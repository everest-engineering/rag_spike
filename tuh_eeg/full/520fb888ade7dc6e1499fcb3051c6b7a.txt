CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of seizures, now seizure-free for the last 20 years, also history of migraines, TIA.  She presented with a breakthrough seizure on September 16, 2013, with loss of consciousness and post-ictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal
INTRODUCTION:  This is a 20 min digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  There were some technical limitations with this record due to construction.  The EEG was satisfactory overall.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 12 Hz.  Stage II sleep was characterized by sleep spindles and vertex waves and K complexes.
There was intermittent left temporal focal slowing noted during drowsiness.  Hyperventilation seem to accentuate the focal slowing in the left temporal area.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving with Harmonic and super Harmonic driving.
The heart rate:  72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to
intermittent left temporal focal slowing; intermittent in drowsiness, more sustained during hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this patient.  Left temporal focal slowing has been previously described.  This is the patient's 5th EEG and only 1 single sharp wave was ever recorded on any of the studies.
