History:	20 YR MALE STUDENT TUH PRESENTS WITH CC OF FATIGUE, HA, MOOD
SWINGS, MEMORY PROBLEMS. S/P MULTI CONCUSSIONS. (FOOTBALL). HAD 2
CONCUS IN 2 WKS NOVEMBER 2014.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2
sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles.
No focal slowing.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
