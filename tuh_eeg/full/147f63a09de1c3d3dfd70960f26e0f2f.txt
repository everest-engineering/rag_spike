CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old male with new onset embolic stroke, focal tonic
clonic seizures, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, skin cancer, and prostate cancer.
Fosphenytoin, Heparin, Famotidine, Zosyn, Acetaminophen,
Lorazepam, Vancomycin, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is awake with eye
movement. There is a mixed frequency, but slow pattern with primarily theta frequency
activity, suggestion of an alpha rhythm, and intermittent bursts of delta. There are
shifting asymmetries noted. As he drifts off to sleep, the activity is a little slower on the
right and then the patient arouses spontaneously.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Prominent shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed. There is
independent focal slowing from either hemisphere, suggesting a bihemispheric process.
This may represent acute and/or chronic pathology.
