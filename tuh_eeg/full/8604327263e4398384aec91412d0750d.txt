History:	54 YO MALE, RT. SDH, RT. FRONTO-PARIETAL CRANIOTOMY. NOTED 2
EPISODES OF WITNESSED SZ TWITCHING WITHOUT CONFUSION LASTING
FEW SEC.  PMH: ETOH ABUSE, SZS. D/O, DEAF
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eye
opening.  Diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over the right hemisphere.  No sleep architecture
was present.
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the right temporal region (maximum at T4)
during wakefulness.  There is breach rhythm over the right hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 80.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal
Beta, bilateral diffuse, higher amplitude on the right
Breach artifact, right
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is an abnormal awake EEG due to  intermittent focal slowing in the right
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with a
history of ICH.  Breach artifact is also consistent with a history of right craniotomy.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
