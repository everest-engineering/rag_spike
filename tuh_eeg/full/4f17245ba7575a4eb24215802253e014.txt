DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a diffuse amount of beta seen excessively throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
