History:	28 year old man who was found down after a prolonged period of time.  He now
remains nearly comatose.
Medications:	Fentanyl, versed
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  There is continuous significant EMG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EMG
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absence of clear
background reactivity.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  There is large amount of EMG artifact that limits interpretation of the study.
