History:  27 year old woman with seizure since age 20. Has two types. Type 1: sudden stiffening/shaking of lower extremities without LOC. Type 2: Generalized shaking with loss of consciousness. Come to EMU for differential and possible pre-surgical evaluation.
Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:
The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk. Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options. If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate.
Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked,which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus ;
The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient safety during seizures;
The full hospital team must be present to deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient's exam (9) there have been 13 reported deaths during various video-EEG monitoring procedures, so this is not a "low risk" service
Conditions of the recording:
A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring. The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system. Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system. Sphenoidal electrodes were not used in this case. Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms. EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive. Periods of interest were subsequently reformatted to the montage of interest and reviewed in detail.
Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior. For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician . A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a registered nurse with special training in seizure recognition and testing. During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.
Samples of EEG were recorded periodically. Detections were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
DESCRIPTION OF EMU EVALUATION:
Initial EEG:
A routine 21-channel initial EEG was performed with the patient awake. The posterior dominant rhythm was a symmetric 1O Hz.

Event #1:PNES Date:  06/08/2015 Baseline:
Clinical features:
Time:   11:28PM
EEG features :
At onset there is slight drowsiness followed by
While in bed the patient suddenly lifts up her arms in a quick jolt and at the same time starts having rapid low amplitude irregular shaking both legs (not well visualized under the covers). She looks for the alarm button and pushes it.. She is not tested and the event last for 11 seconds.
muscle artifact but no clear EEG change or correlate to the behavior.
Event #2: PNES
Date: 06/1212015	Time:  12:50PM
Baseline:
Clinical features :
Patient complains of feeling dizzy for minutes, then suddenly her legs begin to tremble irregularly and her arms flex in front of her. She then extends her arms and turns to the right while arching her back. She remains in this position through the rest of the event which last about 2.5 minutes. She does not follow commands during the event but afterwards she remembers the code word. She states that was the only word she was able to hear during the event and does not remember anything else.
EEG features :
No clear EEG change or correlate to the behavior. Normal awake background.
INDUCTION PROCEDURES:
Sleep deprivation
Exercise
SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:
lnterictal Findings:
None
lctal Findings:
The patient had 2 clinical events while hooked up to continuous video EEG monitoring in the epilepsy monitoring unit.
SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Psychogenic non-epileptic events (PNEE)
CONCLUSION:
Patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 4 days with continuous video EEG.
The interictal EEG was normal awake and asleep. The patient was weaned off Zonisamide and Trileptal over the course of her admission. She was restarted on Zonisamide prior to her discharge from the hospital. No other medication changes were made during the hospitalization.
The patient had a discussion with doctor about nonepileptic events and their association with underlying psychiatric co-morbidities and the fact that they are not due to abnormal electrical discharges of the brain/cortex.
We recommend her to see a psychiatrist or therapist for assessment of underlying psychopathology and diagnosis.
