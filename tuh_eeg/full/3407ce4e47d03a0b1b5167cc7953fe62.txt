History:	76 YR FEMALE PRESENTED TO TUH W/ DIFFICULT SPEECH, AT DECREASED
PO. PMHX: NSCLC (DX 2013), STAGE 4 WITH METS BRAIN. BONE CA, S/P CTX,
STEREOTACTIC RADIATION 12/13,  HTN, TIA. PT IS FLAT. CT 2 R
CEREBELLAR HYPODEN, LEFT FRONTAL HYPOD, AND SYLVIAN FISSURE
Medications:	ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is nearly continuous theta, and occasionally delta, activity noted
over the left and right hemispheres independently.  The slowing disrupts the background posterior
dominant rhythm.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
There is focal left hemisphere slowing noted intermittently throughout the recording.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG due to focal left hemisphere slowing superimposed on diffuse
bihemispheric slowing. These findings suggest a structural brain lesion in the left hemisphere and
diffuse brain injury or a toxic-metabolic effect.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
