CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman who was treated with Levaquin for a sinus infection and began to have increasing small seizure-like symptoms characterized by an electrical feeling followed by a spacey feeling.  The patient then began to take more Ativan.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is generous beta noted throughout.  In this very sharply contoured record, there is isolated, left to right temporal focal slowing.  Drowsiness produces an increase in beta with anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  POSTS were noted in stage I sleep.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent excess beta.
Occasional, isolated right or left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a previous EEG in 2002, which identified wicket and independent right or left temporal sharply contoured slowing.  The 2007 EEG was not available for comparison.  The generous beta noted in this EEG may reflect this patient's medications.  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.
The focal slowing is in the temporal region, but there are no definitive sharp waves or spikes.
