HISTORY:
An 87-year-old woman,  with heart failure exacerbation. Past history of a large left MCA
infarct. The patient had experienced abrupt impaired responsiveness and was transferred to Temple. New R MCA CVA
MEDICATIONS:
Coumadin, Norvasc, digoxin, others
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background of EEG demonstrates a pattern of primarily rhythmic background slowing
with 6 to 7 Hz background. Stimulation, the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity with at times a 7 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm. There is intermittent bilateral attenuation, somewhat asymmetric attenuation. The left is lower
voltage on the left than the right. There are some simple T 4 sharp waves noted. Occasional R Centrotemporal focal
slowing is noted
Heart rate irregular at 90 bpm
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Background attenuation.
3. Reduced amplitude on the left.
4. Handful of simple T 4 sharp waves.
5. Occasional R Centrotemporal focal slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall, this is a diffusely slow record. Given this patient's clinical history, there is very little
in the way of focal slowing from the left. Correlation with additional imaging and/or clinical history is suggested.
