CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old male, status post subdural hematoma on December 20, 2010, bilateral subdural hematomas, ultimately developing simple partial seizures which include speech arrest without impairment of awareness.  Others included left facial droop or left sided numbness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Antibiotics, Atenolol, Simvastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is prominent beta.  A breech rhythm can be identified in the transition to drowsiness and it can be seen in the right central or occasionally left frontal regions. In hyperventilation and in the transition to sleep occasional focal slowing is noted in the right central region.  As the patient becomes a little bit more drowsy, there are also some bursts of focal slowing, lower voltage, a bit more subtle in the left frontal region. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right central region.
More subtle bursts of slowing in the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings have been identified in previous EEGs.  Of note, only the first EEG recorded in May 2011 identified sharp waves.  Those sharp waves were in the left frontal central region.
