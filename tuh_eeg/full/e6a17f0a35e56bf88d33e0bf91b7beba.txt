CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed woman with a long history of epilepsy and left frontal mass, vagal nerve stimulator, bipolar disease, and depression.  Seizures characterized by tremoring of the left arm, staring, then the right shoulder, followed by postictal drowsiness accompanied by tachycardia.

MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, Vancomycin, Dexamethasone, Risperidone, Ativan

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has a recent left frontal craniotomy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow.  There is primarily a theta frequency pattern.  In addition to a craniotomy defect, there are some T1 sharp waves as well as a handful of sharp waves noted in the right frontotemporal region.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Slight attenuation of faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region relative to the right.
3. A handful of sharp waves, some on the left, but occasionally in the right frontotemporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is more supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Some of the sharp waves are in the region of her recent craniotomy.
