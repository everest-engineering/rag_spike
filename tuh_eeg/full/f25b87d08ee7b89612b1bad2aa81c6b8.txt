AGE: 38 y.o.
SEX :male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/30/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG # : 15-1740
HISTORY :
38 y.o. male with a history of reported seizures since age 14, cerebral aneurysm, schizophrenia , anxiety,
and OM referred for routine EEG after presenting with seizure (shaking + tongue bitten) followed by left sided weakness and slurred speech .
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox , insulin SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The study consists of mostly drowsiness and stage II sleep.
During brief periods of wakefulness, the background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTs, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
