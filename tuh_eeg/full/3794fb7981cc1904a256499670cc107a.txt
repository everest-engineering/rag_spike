CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year female , status post cardiac arrest on March 21, 2012, now with head bobbing, comatose, unresponsive with dilated pupils.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Mannitol, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a greater than 40 minute record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern with burst suppression activity. There are brief bursts of rhythmic, higher amplitude sharply contoured theta frequency activity. Tactile stimulation does not activate the record. Most bursts are about 3 seconds in duration. Head bobbing artifact was noted.  With the use of vecuronium it disappeared.
HR:    120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern.
Absence of reactivity.
Absence of variability.
Bursts of activity which are high amplitude with rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity.  Some of these seem to have a sharp wave in the frontal region.  They are asynchronous and may start in the right or left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is characteristic of a severe, underlying encephalopathy.  No prolonged seizures were recorded.
