CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old left handed man with history of seizures, hepatitis C cirrhosis, traumatic brain injury, and myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Metoprolol, Zosyn, Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during coma.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some frequent muscle artifact seen throughout the recording, mainly in the temporal region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a disorganized background with no real posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  No activating procedures were performed. During the recording the technician tries to involve the patient with verbal stimuli, as well as noxious stimuli, and ocular pressures, however, there is no change in the EEG pattern.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 1-2 Hz with an amplitude of around 10 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked generalized slow waves.
Low amplitude.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
