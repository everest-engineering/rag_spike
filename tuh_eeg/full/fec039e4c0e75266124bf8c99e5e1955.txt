CLINICAL HISTORY: Gunshot wound to the head, admitted December 30th.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Mannitol, fentanyl, Versed, Zofran, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard
10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is
responsive and has eye movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively
continuous low-voltage pattern. It is a mixed frequency pattern with generous 8-9 Hz
alpha frequency activity and some theta frequency activity. There is occasional 9 Hz
activity in the background with some frontal 8-9 Hz activity. On the few occasions with
eye opening and eye closure, that seems to produce approximately 6 Hz posterior
dominant activity. The background demonstrates intermittent attenuation.
Using slow paper speed the attenuation in the slow delta seems to be a little slower on
)the right compared to the left.
Heart rate is 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to
1. A mixed frequency background with paucity of the normal waveforms.
2. Slower delta on the right.
3. The normal waveforms that are identified are somewhat slow.
