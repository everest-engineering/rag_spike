MEDICATIONS: Xanax, propranolol, and others.
PROCEDURE NOTE: This is a 40-year-old right-handed pediatric dentist with chronic daily headaches characterized by pain in the right periorbital
region and in the right trapezius.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low voltage about 10Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage frontal central beta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits generous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
Heart rate 54 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG is an anticipated finding in migraine headache.
