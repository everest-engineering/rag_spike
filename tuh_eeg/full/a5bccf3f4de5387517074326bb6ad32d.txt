History:	43yo M with a history of TBI and right sided craniotomy and epilepsy presents for
follow up EEG
Medications:	dilantin, phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Increased in amplitude with associated faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  Intermittent
polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region.  Rare focal sharp waves are
present in the right frontotemporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F8.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare, right temporal, anterior, F8
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, right temporal, anterior
Breach artifact, right
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to occasional focal slowing and and
sharp waves in the right anterior temporal region.  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy.
