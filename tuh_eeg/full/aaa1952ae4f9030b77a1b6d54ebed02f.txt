CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old female with diabetes.  Evaluate for seizures.  Episodes of loss of consciousness with tongue biting and eyes rolling back.  Some of these preceded by an aura, as if she is someone else.
MEDICATIONS:  Vicodin, Lantus, metformin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically challenging record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  There is an amplitude asymmetry with a suggestion of her breach rhythm on the right.  In this sharply contoured record, there is both rhythmic and arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right temporal region.  This becomes a bit more prominent, as the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude and seems to accentuate the focal slowing in the right hemisphere as well as some right temporal sharply contoured slowing maximum at T4.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Right temporal focal slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing with underlying sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although, there is a fair amount of artifact in this EEG, the right temporal features are well defined in consideration for a focal mechanism for epilepsy is appropriate.
