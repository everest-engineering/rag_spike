CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old woman with osteoarthritis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia with intermittent facial numbness, face feels like it falls asleep.  It is an outpatient EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol, metoprolol, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory 20-minute routine EEG in a patient found who seemed to be very tense.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage.  There is a 7.7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of background theta.
Photic stimulation was performed early on in the record producing vigorous bilateral driving.  This is a technically challenging EEG with a great deal of artifact noted, but there is excess theta, some shifting slowing, and at times an asymmetry in which the background seems to be a little slower on the right compared to the left.
Heart rate 55 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing with at times, appearance of a slower pattern on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be considered.
