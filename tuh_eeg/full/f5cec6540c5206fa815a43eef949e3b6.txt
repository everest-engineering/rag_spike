ADDENDUM:
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation activated the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 26-minute EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing sleep may be of value.
