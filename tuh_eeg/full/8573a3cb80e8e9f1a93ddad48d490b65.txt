CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old woman with status post clip a right MCA and left MCA aneurysms, surgery was 18 months ago.  Previous EEG monitoring 1 year ago.  Currently, seizure-free.  She did experience seizures in June of 2013, however.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Notable in this record as the breach rhythm noted from the left temporal region.  There is intermittent, rhythmic, higher amplitude more prominent, left temporal focal slowing, as well as underlying more subtle slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity in the context of her breach rhythm.  At times, the focal slowing is sharply contoured.
In maximal wakefulness, the focal slowing is less prominent.  It does seem to be accentuated by hyperventilation and by drowsiness.
Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response, identifiable bilaterally.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left temporal region, more prominent in drowsiness or hyperventilation.
Rare bursts of shifting, slowing with a single burst of slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this patient.  Since her initial recovery, the EEGs have consistently demonstrated a pattern of focal slowing, but not epileptiform activity.  If there is any question, a more prolonged study capturing sleep may be evaluated.
