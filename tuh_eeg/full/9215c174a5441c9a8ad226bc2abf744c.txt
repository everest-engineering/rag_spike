REFLUX,  THYROID CA.  R/O MIGRAINES.
Medications:	ZANTAC, VITAMIN, SYNTHROID, PARAGARD (IUD)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a PDR that at best reaches 8.5-9Hz, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 66.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.
