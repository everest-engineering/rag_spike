CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 61-year-old male for repair of aortic root pathology, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial flutter, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity and pacemaker.
MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, Toprol, flecainide others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed. This is a technically acceptable, greater than 20 minute EEG.  T1-T2 impedances were not ideal.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm present bilaterally.  There is a small amount of background theta noted in wakefulness.  The patient is quite tense, with frequent bruxism.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Occasional theta noted in the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background theta described above is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There were rare bursts of shifting slowing noted in the record, but none outside of the range of normal for a subject of this age.
