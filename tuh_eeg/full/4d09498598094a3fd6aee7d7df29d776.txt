MEDICATIONS: Zofran, Plavix, Paricalcitol, Phoslo, Advair, ASA, Metoprolol, Nifedipine, Heparin, Gabapentin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated but somewhat responsive.   DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a rhythmic theta pattern for much of the record with rhythmic 3.5 to 4Hz activity. This is followed by an intermittently discontinuous pattern with eye movement. There are a handful of triphasic waves observed in the background, Some of the waveforms resemble eye movement but they do not seem to be associated with movement of the eyes. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not clearly produce a change in the EEG  HR: 100 bpm  IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a number of concerning patterns. These include: 1. A theta background. 2. An intermittent burst suppression pattern. 3. Triphasic waves 2. An EEG which fails to demonstrate reactivity or variability.

Clinical CORRELATION: These findings suggest a significant CNS injury and additional clinical evaluation may be appropriate.
