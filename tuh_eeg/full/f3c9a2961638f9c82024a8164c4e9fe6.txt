MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Heparin, Hydralazine, Amlodipine, Warfarin, Advair.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of dizziness
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient also has some normal frontal central beta while awake, however, the patient easily drowses up and goes into sleep and quickly goes into stage I, stage II sleep.  The majority of the recording is in sleep as the patient easily falls asleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.   Please note that the shortened sleep latency may represent sleep architecture abnormality and further evaluation with a sleep consultation study may be helpful.
