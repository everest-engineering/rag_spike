History:	48 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF CVA 6/12 LEFT HEMIPARESIS., SCHIZOPHRENIA.
CC OF LIGHTHEADEDNESS AND FALLS.  HEAD 55CM
Medications:	PLAVIX, LIPITOR, TRAZODONE, DEPAKOTE, COGENTIN, RISPERDAL,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which is best seen over the
left hemisphere and attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over the left frontal regions and not well seen over the right hemisphere.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
There is continuous right hemispheric slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing and loss of
faster frequencies in the right hemisphere.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in
this region and consistent with the known stroke.
