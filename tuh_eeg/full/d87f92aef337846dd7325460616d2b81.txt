CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old right handed male preoperative for left carotid
endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background demonstrates an alpha pattern of 9.8
Hz activity. There was wickets, but there was also T3 sharp waves in stage 1 sleep.
There was a limited stage 2 sleep. There was subtle left temporal slowing.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves in T3.
2. Some left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Left temporal focal slowing could be due .to
cerebrovascular ischemia. Sharp waves were seen in T3. The sharp waves were
simple in pathology, but very distinct May need to get a repeat EEG in the future.
Sharp waves may be related to the cerebrovascular ischemia. No clinical seizures were
identified in the video EEG, but the sharp waves could support epileptiform activity.
Repeat EEG would be needed.
