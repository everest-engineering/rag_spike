History:	52 YR OLD MALE R HANDED FOUND DOWN OUTSIDE ED. PT HAD A SDH PMHX
HTN DM.60 CM HEAD
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of faster frequencies with an absence on the
left.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right central
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right central region.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is loss of faster
frequencies on the left hemisphere which is indicative of a cortical structural  lesion or subdural
collection in that region. Lastly there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
