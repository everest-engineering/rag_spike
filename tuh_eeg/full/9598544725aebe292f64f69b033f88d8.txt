electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
There is continuous focal delta slowing present over the right hemisphere maxima in the fronto-
temporal region.  There are very frequent right fronto-temporal sharp waves seen maximal at F8-
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, right temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to focal slowing and spikes in the right
fronto-temporal region. These findings are indicative of a structural brain lesion and potentially
epileptogenic focus in this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent
with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy.
