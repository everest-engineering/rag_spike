CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old woman, status post code on the 22nd with myoclonus and clinical seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Midazolam, Depakote, Atropine, Lasix, Lipitor, Heparin, Pantoprazole, Hydralazine

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Propofol was initiated on the 24th.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial seconds of the record demonstrate a highly irritative pattern.  Although there are no clinical seizures, there are focal sharp waves noted on the left.  By 6:50 p.m., there is an intermittently discontinuous pattern.  There is also an asymmetry with a bit more suppressed pattern on the right than the left.  Some sections demonstrate more beta than others.

There are no sustained seizures at this point, just an irritative pattern.  Over the course of the night, and even in the early morning, the EEG demonstrates a richer background.  There are left temporal sharp waves, but they are improving.  Despite the use of sedative hypnotic medications, the EEG is increasingly reactive.

HR:    90 bpm

IMPRESSION/CORRELATION; This is a markedly abnormal and irritative EEG but one that shows improvement over time with a reduction in epileptiform activity and an overall improvement in the background.
