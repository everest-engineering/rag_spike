CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old found unresponsive with a pontine hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Cardene, Versed drip, fentanyl and others.
ROOM NUMBER:  ED-10.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a pattern with generalized beta.  The beta is most prominent frontal.  There are minor asymmetries noted in the posterior region.  Occasional rhythmic isolated waves of theta or delta were noted.
Tactile stimulation of the patient did not significantly activate the record.
As the recording continues, there a bit more slowing in the right posterior quadrant relevant to the left.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Replacement of normal background with excess beta.
Minor asymmetry with a bit more slowing in the right posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generous beta may reflect this patient's medications.  The slight focality described above may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.
