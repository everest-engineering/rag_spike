History:	41 year old man who presents after a prolonged cardiovascular arrest.  He is now
unresponsive and has continuous left eyelid rapid twitching.
Medications:	no AEDs, no sedation recently
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background is attenuated and consists of frequent bursts of
polymorphic various frequency delta activity.  Some of this activity is clearly a result of respiration
and ventilator artifacts.  No normal sleep architecture is present
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked
Attenuation
Artifact, respiration
Artifact, ventilator
Artifact, 60Hz
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 22-minute portable comatose EEG due to marked diffuse slowing. These
findings are indicative of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
The technologist does not comment on presence or absence of eyelid twitching during the
