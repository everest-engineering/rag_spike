History:	26 YO FEMALE WITH C/C OF CONTINUOUS NAUSEA AND OCCASIONAL
VOMITING WITH DIZZINESS. STARTED IN 2003 POST RIGHT FRONTO-
TEMPORAL TUMOR REMOVAL.
Medications:	ZOFRAN, PAMELOR, AMPHETAMINE-DEXTROAMPHETAMINE,  AND OTHERS IN
RECORD.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an associated breach in this region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid, associated breach
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region, which is
consistent with the known tumor and removal.
