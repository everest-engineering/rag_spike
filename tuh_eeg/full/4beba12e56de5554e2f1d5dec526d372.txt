CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old nursing home resident with previous right posterior fossa tumor, multiple medical problems including renal failure, hypertension, lung mass, metastatic brain tumor, possible interval stroke, declining mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, metoprolol, aspirin, Megace, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had difficulty understanding the task.  This was a technically acceptable EEG with impedances generally under 5 kilo ohms.  Photic stimulation was performed, but hyperventilation was not possible.  The patient was able to follow commands during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall background EEG is markedly disorganized.  There is excess theta, and there is no well-defined posterior dominant rhythm.  The central regions have more beta than other areas.  Arrhythmic delta is noted from either posterior region.
Broadly contoured periodic complexes are noted intermittently from the right occipital or posterior temporal region with variable field and variable spread.  These do not evolve.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Stimulation of the patient seems to ameliorate some of the periodic complexes in the right posterior quadrant and on rare occasions, with stimulation, there is a glimpse of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with some shifting asymmetries right or left.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly abnormal background with bilateral slowing and disruption of faster frequency activity.
Poorly formed periodic complexes in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bilateral disturbance of cerebral function.  The epileptiform activity is in the region of the patient's previous tumor resection.  No seizures were recorded, but ongoing vigilance for recurrent seizures is suggested.
