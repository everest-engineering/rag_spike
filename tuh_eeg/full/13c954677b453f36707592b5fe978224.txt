CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed man with past medical history of seizures who now presents with an episode of witnessed syncope when he stood up from a chair yesterday.  The patient states that he felt like he was going to pass out, felt lightheaded.  He was out for approximately 30-45 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Advair, Keppra, Neurontin, Lisinopril, Protonix, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 11-12 Hz fast activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During sleep, vertex waves and bursts of theta are captured; however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  Hyperventilation produces mild diffuse background slowing.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  Sinus bradycardia with heart rate less than 60 beats a minute is captured on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Sinus bradycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical suspicion for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Sinus bradycardia with heart rate less than 60 is captured in a single EKG lead.
