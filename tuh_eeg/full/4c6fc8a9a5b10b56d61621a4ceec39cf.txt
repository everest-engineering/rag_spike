CLINICAL HISTORY:   65 year old right handed woman with significant atherosclerosis, recent bypass surgery, admitted to the hospital earlier this month for dizzy spells.  She continues to have positional feeling of vertigo, as well as an electrical sensation in her left neck.  Impaired feeling in the right arm.   She has a past history of TIA.

MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, Oxybutynin, Plavix, Methimazole, Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Pantoprazole, Metoprolol, Isosorbide, Meclizine, ASA, Amiodarone, Hydro-morphine

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a 10 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. In the transition to drowsiness, there is some independent right or left temporal theta.

HR:    54 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, although that does not seem to be a big part of this
patient's consideration.  In this individual with significant vascular disease, this is a normal EEG.
