CLINICAL HISTORY:  History of migraine headache, epilepsy following head trauma.  Patient reports a 2-week history of coma followed by a handful of seizures, currently seizure free for 3 years.  Does not take seizure medications regularly.  Has an occipital headache or a vertex headache
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable, routine EEG, aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation produced bilateral driving.
HEART RATE:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  This is the second normal EEG for this adult.
