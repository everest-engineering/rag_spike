CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old left handed female with dementia, delirium, confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Metformin, Hydrocodone, ASA,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background is relatively low voltage with a scant, 8 Hz alpha rhythm and generous beta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in the amplitude of the background. Following hyperventilation as the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta, rare bursts of temporal slowing followed by vertex waves and posts. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this record. This EEG is within the limits of normal. It is overall a lower voltage pattern. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered. In addition, repeat studies may be helpful in monitoring the patient's cerebral pattern in the context of dementia/delirium.
