CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old right-handed woman with adult-onset recurrent seizures with previous normal EEG, events without aura, loss of consciousness, and associated injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as a focal response.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Notable findings in this EEG include rhythmic left temporal theta which waxes and wanes, increasing in drowsiness.  In addition, occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves with after-going slow waves, medium to high amplitude were noted in wakefulness around the time of photic stimulation.  Photic stimulation also seems to accentuate the rhythmic slowing and sharp waves.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic left temporal slowing.
Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These are new findings for this individual and support a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
