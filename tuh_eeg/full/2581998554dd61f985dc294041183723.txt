CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old woman with right temporal hemorrhage in 2009, headaches, chest pain, seizure free for more than 4 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Folate, Zocor, prednisone, niacin, calcium, aspirin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with most impedance below 5 kilohms.  Hyperventilation was performed, but photic stimulation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally.  There is generous, frontal central beta.  Nearly continuous focal slowing is noted in the right hemisphere primarily in the right temporal region and at times a bit more prominent in the mid temporal or posterior temporal region.  Features of sleep include an increase in beta and drowsiness, followed by theta and then a glimpse of spindle activity.  Sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to the 2010 and 2012 EEGs, which demonstrated focal slowing, but no sharp waves.  The EEG from November 15, 2009 was not available today.  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality in the right hemisphere, congruent with a history of previous right temporal hemorrhage.
