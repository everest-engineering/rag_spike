History:	47 year old man with a history of seizures secondary to a prior TBI.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
No clear focal slowing is captured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Excess low amplitude EMG artifact is present throughout the recording, so
subtle findings could have been missed.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, EMG
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a normal awake-only 22 minute EEG  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.  Excess low amplitude EMG artifact is present throughout the recording, so
subtle findings could have been missed.
