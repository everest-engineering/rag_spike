CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with dementia, frequent falling, and back pain, previously evaluated for syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was restless, but was able to cooperate with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the patient's restlessness in true artifact, the background EEG includes diffuse theta without a clearly defined posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation did not clearly activate the record, although the patient was moving about quite a bit.  At the close of the record, there is some additional frontal delta noted.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to.
Replacement of normal background with primarily theta frequency pattern.
Prominent frontal delta which may represent a drowsy pattern, although the patient does seem to be somewhat restless at that time.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to the previous EEG of December 17, 2014.  No epileptiform features were identified in either record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing more prolonged sleep may be of value.
