CLINICAL HISTORY:	23 year old right handed woman with complex partial epilepsy, seizure-free,  with recurrent seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is a one-hour sleep-deprived record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well-organized background with 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly drifts in and out of sleep with POSTS. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, but the patient is drifting
into stage II  sleep. Spikey POSTS are observed in the abundant stage II  sleep record. In  the sleep recording, there is an amplitude asymmetry for the POSTS which are high amplitude and on one occasion a left parietal sharp wave.  Additionally, with this subtle asymmetry there is also noted asymmetry with more muscle artifact on the right. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is essentially asleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR:	78 bpm


IMPRESSION: Questionably abnormal EEG due to:
1.  A single left parietal sharp wave.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The amplitude asymmetry of the POSTS is an acceptable variant. A single sharp wave is a nonspecific finding. It may represent artifact, and there are other artifacts noted in this record at this time.
