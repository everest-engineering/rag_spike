REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease, CAD, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and hepatitis who presents with chest pain and found to have osteomyelitis in the sternum as well as episodes of unresponsiveness and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  None written.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic and uncooperative and agitated.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T5 electrode artifact and some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse slow background with various frequencies intermixed mainly in theta and delta range with a posterior dominant rhythm that at times appears to be in the theta range of 5-6 Hz intermixed with an overall delta frequency background and triphasic waves.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures are performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts is seen continuously throughout the recording, at times with intermittent theta frequencies.
Triphasic waves seen frequently throughout the recording and appeared to be maximal anteriorly, at times with a frequency 1-5 to 2 Hz seen frequently throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing and triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which may be at least due in part to metabolic encephalopathy.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
