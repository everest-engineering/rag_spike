CLINICAL HISTORY:   25 year old woman 8 months pregnancy with epilepsy since age
18.  The last tonic clonic seizure was in August 2009 during sleep. MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed. This an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a 10 Hz 30 microvolt alpha rhythm.   Drowsiness is characterized by generous beta.  Beta spindles, vertex waves, and POSTS are identified in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 	96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this awake and asleep EEG.  After this the patient delivers her infant, additional EEG recording with activation techniques may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity. Alternatively, comparison with previous EEG's may also be beneficial.  The generous beta activity could be associated with medications or anxiety.
