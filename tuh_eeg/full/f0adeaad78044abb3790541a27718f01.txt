CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old male status post intracerebral hemorrhage many years ago involving the cerebellum, now with bitemporal headaches and intermittent episodes in which the patient is somewhat confused.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-organized pattern with an 11 hertz alpha rhythm. In the transition to drowsiness, there is some shifting slowing identified and at one point in drowsiness, there is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more slowing in the left hemisphere compared to the right. Photic stimulation elicits subtle driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: The shifting slowing is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in atherosclerosis or other underlying pathology. There were no definitive sharp waves. If epilepsy is an important consideration, either a repeat tracing capturing one of his confusional spells or a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
