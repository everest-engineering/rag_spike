CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed male with head injury, right frontal
craniotomy and history of epilepsy, but seizure free for a year.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Topiramate, Trazodone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are preformed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is an 11 hertz alpha, symmetric and reactive.
There is intermittent lower voltage delta seen in the central regions bilaterally, central,
frontocentral, at the midline and perhaps slightly higher amplitude on the right.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Following
hyperventilation, as the patient become drowsy, there are bursts of delta and some of
the bursts of delta in the frontal region occur while the alpha is actually relatively
vigorous. The patient transitions in and out of asleep state with vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess delta in the central regions, right more than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The features
described above were relatively modest.
