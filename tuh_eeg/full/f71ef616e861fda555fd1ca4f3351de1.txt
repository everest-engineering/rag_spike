+TOBACCO, ETOH (2/2014) NO CHANGES SINCE THEN PER PT
Medications:	TEGRETOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  Brief bursts (3-4 seconds) of frontally-maximal spike-and-wave
discharges occur with a repetition rate of 2.5 Hz.  At times they appear to be asymmetric in onset
more pronounced on the right or the left.
Stepped photic stimulation of 1 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, slow, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) generalized, Frontal predominant.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent frontal predominant spike-and-
wave, which are epileptogenic.  These are at times asymmetric in onset. The findings may
represent a discharge seen in a symptomatic generalized epilepsy or alternatively this is part of a
focal epilepsy with rapid  bilateral synchrony.
