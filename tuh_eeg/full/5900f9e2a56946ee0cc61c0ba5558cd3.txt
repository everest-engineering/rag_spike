History:	63 YO WOMAN WHO WAS DX WITH EPILEPSY AT 17 YO. SHE HAD GTC SZ,
AND CAN NOT REMEMBER THE DETAILS OF THE SZ. LAST SZ WAS 14-15
YEARS AGO. HER DR. WANTS TO TAKE HER OFF DILANTIN. ANOTHER F/U EEG
NO CHANGES SINCE LAST EEG.
Medications:	DILANTIN, LOSARTAN, NAPROXEN, SIMVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
