CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old male who says "I feel like I'm having a stroke" with
generalized weakness, dizziness, acute renal failure, diabetes, hypertension and
previous stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Warfarin, Pantoprazole, Tylenol, HCTZ, Lasix, Lovastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake record. There
is no hyperventilation. There is no photic simulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a somewhat disorganized
pattern with an alpha rhythm that includes some 7.5 and 8.7 Hz activity. There are
some shifting asymmetries and some excess theta. The patient is awake throughout
much of the record, but as he becomes drowsy, there are some bursts of rhythmic
slowing.
HR: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the magnitude of this patient's concomitant medical
problems, the findings described above are quite modest. No epileptiform features
were observed.
