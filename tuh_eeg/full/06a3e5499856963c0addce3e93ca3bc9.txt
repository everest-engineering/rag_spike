History: 45 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES AND MIGRAINES. PT STATES SHE IS HAVING SEIZURES EVERY NIGHT. PMHX: SZS SINCE CHILD.
Medications: Keppra
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine. Awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background Is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is Present maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent rhythmic theta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness. Increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which Is etiologically non-specific. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
