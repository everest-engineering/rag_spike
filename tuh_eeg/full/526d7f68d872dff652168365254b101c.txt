LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 73-year-old man with a past medical history of seizures, dementia and hepatitis C.  He is now admitted with acute respiratory distress.  On 05/26/2013, he was found to be unresponsive with generalized tonic clonic convulsions.

MEDICATIONS:

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed at the patient's bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 to 8.5 Hz activity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is weak.  There is small polymorphic theta and delta captured.  During drowsiness the background is replaced by diffuse theta mixed with delta activity.  Frequent polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the left hemisphere, more so over the central leads.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

FINDINGS:
1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
2. Intermittent focal left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the central leads.
3. No clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
