REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old man in septic shock and change in mental status.  He has multiple liver abscesses and Candidemia.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hepatitis C, lung transplant, depression, osteoarthritis, COPD and biliary stents.
MEDICATIONS:  CellCept, Prograf, prednisone, Lopressor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  The patient was in a stuporous condition.  Activation procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  EKG lead was nonfunctional for the first few minutes of the recording and was fixed early in the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background is diffusely slow in the delta range bilaterally.  There is some variability in the background during the recording.
Frequent eye movement artifact and chin artifacts were noted.  There is infrequent intermittent suppression of the background.
There is no clear distinction between sleep and wakefulness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Rare anteriorly predominant triphasic morphology waves were noted.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slowing with intermittent suppression.
Rare anteriorly predominant triphasic morphology waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of a diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as toxic metabolic encephalopathy as suggested by the diffuse slowing and rare waves of triphasic morphology.  No clear epileptiform activity was seen.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
