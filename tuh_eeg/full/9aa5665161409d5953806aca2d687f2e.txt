REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 79-year-old man presents with a history of Parkinson's, a previous stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and admission for altered mental status.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some A1/A2 electrode artifact.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zosyn, Cardizem, potassium, lisinopril, Lovenox, senna, Colace, Sinemet, hydrochlorothiazide, vancomycin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7-8 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some slowing of the normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow wave F7/T3 as well as T3 and independently less frequently at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
Heart rate: 78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid and anterior temporal focal slowing, much more frequently than right.  Anterior temporal slowing in addition to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral independent anterior temporal as well as focal cerebral dysfunction in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
