CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old woman with a history of seizures since she was 18 months old.  Feels that she has many types of seizures including grand mal, petit mal, and complex partial.  Also some seizures during sleep.  Last one was in February 2013.  This is a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, folic acid, Elavil, and Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive frontal beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and limited stage I sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation reveal no abnormal discharges.  Please note that the patient has permanent 8-9 Hz rhythmic discharges maximally seen over C4 and at times over C3 in a very monomorphic benign fashion most consistent with MU rhythm.
HEART RATE:  72.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen infrequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
