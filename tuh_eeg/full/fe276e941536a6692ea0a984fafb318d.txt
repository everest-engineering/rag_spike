History:	64 YR FEMALE KNOWN NEURO WITH BREAKTHROUGH SZS. RIGHT SIDE TWITCHING AND JERKING. STOPPED POST 2MG ATIVAN. PMHX: STATUS, CVA, HLD, GERO, . CT. LEFT POST MCA
Medications:	Keppra Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy


Description:
No anteroposterior gradient was seen. No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.

Left hemisphere focal slow maximal in the midtemporal region with associated attenuation of faster frequencies.  Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the T3 region at a rate of 1 Hz. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. HR was 110

Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), left Focal slowing, polymorphic, left
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in the left midtemporal region. These findings are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the left midtemporal region. In addition there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. No electrographic seizures are present.
Please note that patient is tachycardic. The patient is on LTM in NICU.
