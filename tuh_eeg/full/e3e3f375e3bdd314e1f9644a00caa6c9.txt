REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with history of hypertension, right posterior brain mass with change in mental status for 4 days.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonazepam, baclofen, gabapentin, hydralazine, K-Dur.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a diffuse amount of beta seen throughout the recording which is excessive.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the right hemisphere at T4, an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  Please note that there is a slight decrease in the faster frequencies also over this region.
Intermittent focal slowing at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz.  Amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Heart rate 66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right mid temporal focal slowing in addition to some left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is consistent with a known mass.  In addition there is evidence of left focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.
