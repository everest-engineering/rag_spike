History:	83 YR FEMALE WITH COLITIS ( BLEEDING),  NOW WITH VENOUS SINUS
THROMBUS.  EEG FOR PT WITH CHANGE IN MS.
Medications:	flagyl, imipenem, tylenol, atorvastatin, protonix, vancomycin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90  There is an intermittent
central central alpha/beta which at time overrides the temporal delta.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The excessive beta may be due to medication effect.
