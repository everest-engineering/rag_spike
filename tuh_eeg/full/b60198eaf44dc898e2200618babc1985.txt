History:	50 YEAR OLD FEMALE R HANDED FOUND DOWN AT HOME FOR UNKNOWN
PERIOD OF TIME BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL ELEVATED TO 1300.
Medications:	None noted.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and at times central theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Some reactivity was noted.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of marked diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
