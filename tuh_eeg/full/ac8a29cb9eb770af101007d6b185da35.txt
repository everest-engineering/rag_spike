CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year old left handed male with hepatitis B, history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, kidney disease, liver dysfunction, transferred from Episcopal after a seizure and unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, Amlodipine, Zocor, Hydralazine, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins the patient is asleep.  There are some features of stage I sleep.  A prominent breech rhythm is noted in the left central region with prominent accentuation of fast activity.  In addition, focal slowing is observed in that region. Stimulation of the patient produces a brief alerting response with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm at 9.5 Hz.  Mu is also noted.  It is difficult to identify the alpha on the left, but limited wakefulness was noted. In the transition in and out of drowsiness, a theta pattern is seen and there are some shifting asymmetries.  There is a glimpse of the alpha on the right identified later in the record. As the recording continues the patient is restless, arousing, moving about, and then drifting off to sleep.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the left central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  The focal slowing is adjacent to this patient's previous craniotomy.  Of note, the patient was
restless and poorly cooperative.  A metabolic encephalopathy or postictal state may be considered.
