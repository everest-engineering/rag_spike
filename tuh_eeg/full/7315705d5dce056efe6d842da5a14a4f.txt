CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old light handed woman with a tonic-clonic seizure, 8/10/2010, lasting 35 minutes followed by postictal confusion.

MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. During hyperventilation, there are 2 bursts of asynchronous slowing noted with hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness included an increase in beta as well as hypnagogic hypersynchrony. Vertex waves are observed stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 160 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. The 2 asynchronous bursts are of unclear clinical significance. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
