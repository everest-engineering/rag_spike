CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male with tonic-clonic seizures lasting 2 to 3
minutes. He experiences 1 to 3 seizures per year.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a low voltage 8.5 to 9Hz
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Stage
2 sleep was characterized by vertex waves and spindles and POSTS. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving.
HR: 48 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted today. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a
repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered.
