History:	58 YR OLD MALE UNKNOWN HAND DOMINANCE. FOUND IN A BLDG
COLLAPSED 3 STORIES MULTIPLE HEAD FRACTURES AND BLEEDS IN BRAIN.
UNRESPONSIVE INTUBATED. 56 CM HEAD.
Medications:	FENTANYL DRIP KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the mid temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 86
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent focal slowing in the bilateral temporal region.
This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in
origin.In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
