History:	73 year old woman with change in mental status.
Medications:	Fentanyl Drip, (17.5ML) Ativan PRN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm is present.  Background activity is characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and occasional theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Occasional vertex-like waveforms are captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing and lack of
clear reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate-to-severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
