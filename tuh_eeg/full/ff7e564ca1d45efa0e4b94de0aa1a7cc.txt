CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old woman with confusion, right sided shaking, right leg weakness and numbness for a week, possible seizures, kidney stone and hepatitis C.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Zofran, Propranolol, Dilaudid, Hydroxyzine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG shows the background is somewhat slow and mobile with an alpha rhythm of 7-9 Hz.  There are intermittent bursts of paroxysmal higher amplitude rhythmic data and there are also bursts of rhythmic frontal delta which are relatively symmetric.  On rare occasions, there is a tiny, discreet right frontal sharp wave. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Paroxysmal slowing.
A discreet right frontal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features on the left.  This EEG is more suggestive of a metabolic pattern.  If the leg shakiness thought to be epileptiform in nature, the  search for a focus near the midline may be considered.
