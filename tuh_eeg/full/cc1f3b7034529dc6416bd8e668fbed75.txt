History:	72 YR MALE WITH EPISODE LAST THURS OF SHAKING LEANED TO RIGHT,
COULD HEAR WIFE NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE. STOPPED <1 MIN.
DISORIENTED FOR SECONDS.
Medications:	PRIMIDONE, GABAPENTIN,  SEE CHART FOR OTHER MEDS.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Focal slowing may a normal finding for the
patients age.
