CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old man who presented with a chief complaint of left-sided numbness and shaking.  While in the emergency room he was observed having shaking while in the CAT scan.  Past medical history is notable for diabetes, hypertension and neuropathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zolpidem, lisinopril, aspirin, insulin, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well modulated low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No clear sleep is captured.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is captured over the right anterior temporal region.  Hyperventilation produces no change in the background.  Photic stimulation induces symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent moderate right anterior temporal slowing.
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake only, 24 minute EEG due to intermittent moderate anterior right temporal slowing.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction and this case could be structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persistent a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
