EEG LENGTH:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 31-year-old woman with a history of right meningioma.  The patient now has episodes of right-sided hand numbness that starts in the morning and lessens throughout the day.
MEDICATIONS:  Ciprofloxacin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep abundant POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves, and sleep spindles are all captured.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and resolves in mild diffuse symmetrical background slowing.  Stepped photic simulation resolves in symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash rate frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
