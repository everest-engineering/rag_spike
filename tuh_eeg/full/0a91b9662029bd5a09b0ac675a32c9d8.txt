History:	27 year old man with a history of brain tumor, status post resection, and a history of
seizures.
Medications:	LAMICTAL, Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left anterior
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG because of continuous focal slowing in
the left anterior region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  The lack
of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
