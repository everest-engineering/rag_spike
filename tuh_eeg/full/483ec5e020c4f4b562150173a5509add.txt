CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 48-year-old woman found unresponsive on the 5th of February, with a past medical history of drug abuse, hypertension and visual hallucinations, has a CT with an intracerebral hemorrhage and now some hydrocephalus.  She remains lethargic.
MEDICATIONS:  Nicardipine, gentamicin, Ativan, Zosyn, Protonix, metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG is performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system of with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while fully responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  However, when the patient is stimulated, there appears to be some reactivity.  Overall, the background consists of anterior maximal delta slowing that at times, becomes pseudoperiodic and morphology of triphasics waves.  There is a slight increase in faster frequencies over the left compared to the right, but no clear asymmetry can be seen over the hemispheres.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-60 microvolts, at times, a pseudoperiodic pattern and a triphasic morphology.
Slight decrease in faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  Maximally frontal leads.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing, as well as some right frontal loss of faster frequencies.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  However, the presence of pseudoperiodic pattern and triphasic morphology, suggests that it is at least in part, due to metabolic effect. The loss of faster frequencies over the right frontal region may suggest cortical damage in that region or alternatively a fluid collection over that region.
