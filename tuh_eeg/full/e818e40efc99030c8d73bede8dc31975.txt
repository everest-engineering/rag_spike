History:	63 year old female with a history of right ICH and left MCA stroke.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan PRN, Trazodone, Furosemide, Metoprolol, Prilosec, Lisinopril,
Remeron, Simvastatin, Zoloft, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
There is right to left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The
background over the right consists of 9 Hz moderate amplitude PDR with weak anterior-to-posterior
frequency-amplitude gradient and nearly continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity over the
anterior quadrant.  There is no anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient or PDR over the
left.  The background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.
Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Heart rate of 56 bpm is noted on a single
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right anterior, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23-minute EEG due to continuous moderate left hemispheric
slowing and focal right anterior slowing. These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction over the
left hemisphere and right anterior region, respectively, likely structural in etiology, and are
consistent with patient's history of prior strokes.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
