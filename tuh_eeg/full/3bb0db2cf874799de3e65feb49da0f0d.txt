History:	59 YO MALE P/W APHASIA AND RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS. WHEN THE PT GOT
TO THE ED HE WAS TALKING AGAIN AND MOVING THE RIGHT SIDE BUT NOT
BACK TO BASELINE. PMH: HTN, DM HEAD CT AND MRI NEGATIVE
Medications:	LOPRESSOR, ASA, LASIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a (low amplitude) 10uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric <10uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta
activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
