CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old male with a history of stroke and 11-month history of seizures, right-sided weakness.  The patient had a seizure 1 month ago with dizziness, visual scintillations.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was noted to have a left cranial defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage.  There is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is somewhat higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is some subtle focal slowing noted in the left hemisphere.  Vertex waves were noted in sleep. Breach rhythm was characterized by amplitude accentuation in the left frontal region in drowsiness
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm. Occ PVCs
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A relatively low-voltage pattern.
Intermittent focal slowing from the left.
Subtle infrequent breach rhythm characterized by amplitude accentuation in the left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The focal slowing may be correlated with this patient's imaging and occasional PVCs were noted in the EKG lead.
