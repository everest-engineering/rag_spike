CLINICAL HISTORY:  74 year old right handed man with hypertension and end-stage renal disease, CAD, an ICH in 2010, prostate cancer, presented with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl, Keppra, Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness as well as lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness with some stage changes, but no normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen continuously.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild-to-moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
