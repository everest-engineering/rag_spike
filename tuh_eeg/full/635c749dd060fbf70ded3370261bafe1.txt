History:	79 YO WOMAN S/P VT CODE 50 MINUTES, HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL,
UNRESPONSIVE.
Medications:	HYDROGEN,INSULIN,LIDOCAINE,VASOPRESSIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was at best characterized by
diffusely attenuated activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 72  Technical difficulties: There is a continuous marked
bitemporal muscle artifact and diffuse impedance artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an very limited ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background attenuation and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cortical
dysfunction.  Please note that due to technical issues this is a markedly limited EEG and no clear
conclusions can be made about cerebral activity. A repeat EEG with paralytics and after hair
cleaning maybe beneficial if clinically desired.
