CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with hepatitis C, coronary artery disease, and change in mental status.  The patient recently treated with interferon, ribavirin, and Incivek.
MEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Protonix, methylprednisolone, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  The patient was quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG was diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and irregular delta.  Prominent shifting slowing was noted.  Occasional FIRDA was observed.  Rare triphasic waves were noted and seemed to be augmented by photic stimulation.  Rare lambda was also noted.  No significant driving response was seen.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
Poor organization.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are nonspecific and are relatively characteristic of toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up EEG may be valuable.
