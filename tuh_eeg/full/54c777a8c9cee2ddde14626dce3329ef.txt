History:	20 YR MALE S/P GSW CHEEK BELOW T1 ON 4/5/14.  THEN 1 WK LATER GTC
SZ. . PT WITH EXTRA AXIAL HEMATOMA/MANDIBULAR CONDYLE AND
ZYGOMATIC ARCH FXS. PT ALSO COMPLAINING OF VERTIGO WHEN TURNS
Medications:
KEPPRA, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
78  Technical difficulty: abnormal eye movement artifact
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
