History:	70 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS W/ GEN
INCREASE IN TONE IN ARMS-LEGS ( FINE TREMORS) LASTING 20 MIN. LOADED
WITH VERSED, ATIVAN AND KEPPRA IN ED. PMHX SIG FOR IDDM, HIV
Medications:	Dilantin, Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were
correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the
bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by polymorphic
and monomorphic diffuse low voltage1-3 Hz delta and 5-6Hz theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There is excess beta activity seen as well.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
