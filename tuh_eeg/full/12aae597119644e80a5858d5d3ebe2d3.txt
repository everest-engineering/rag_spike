MEDICATIONS: Keppra, prednisone. and others.
CLINICAL HISTORY: An 86-year-old male with previous right temporal lobe hemorrhage, progressive dementia, and Increasing forgetfulness.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred. Photic stimulation was completed.
Previous EEGs were not provided for review.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Intermittently, in wakefulness, there is generalized background slowing. In the transition to sleep, focal slowing is noted from the left hemisphere with dropout of the alpha rhythm earlier on the left in comparison to the right and an asymmetry with a bit more theta from the left hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation was obscured by muscle movement artifact and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 58 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to: Left temporal focal slowing.
In this Individual with progressive cognitive decline, previous EEGs were not available for comparison. In any case, no epileptiform features were noted.
