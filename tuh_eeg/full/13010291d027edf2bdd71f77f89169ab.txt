History:	79 year old woman with a history of meningioma resection and seizures prior to
meningioma resection.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 18.5-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During brief stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  A single EKG lead shows irregular heart rate, prolonged runs of
abnormal QRS complexes (possible PVCs) and occasional up to 2 second inter-QRS pauses.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2, brief
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1-hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and briefly asleep. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead
shows irregular heart rate, prolonged runs of abnormal QRS complexes (possible PVCs) and
occasional up to 2 second inter-QRS pauses.  Samples of these findings were printed and faxed to
patient's PCP and cardiologist.
