CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old male with refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, ZONISAMIDE, Buspar, Folate Acid, Seroquel, Diazepam,
Clorazepate, Valium
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern lacking in the Typical wave forms of an awake adult. It is relatively low voltage and featureless with frequent high amplitude slow spike and wave activity of approximately 2-3 Hz. In addition, there is predominant polyspike activity, focal epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, frontal central, and some isolated discharges from the left. There is likely 1 seizure in this EEG during photic stimulation, but after the 7 Hz stimulation concludes when the Patient has a burst of alpha frequency activity on the right with head turning to the left.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: markedly ABNORMAL EEG due to:
1. Absence of normal wave forms for an adult of this age.
2. High amplitude spike and wave activity and polyspike and wave activity.
3. Focal activity more prominent on the right, but seen independently from the left.
4. Seizure in right
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are seen In Lennox-Gastaut type syndrome and are quite typical. Is focal activity and in this EEG, at least, it is a bit more prominent on the right.
