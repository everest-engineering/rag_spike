CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old, right-handed woman with intermittent left-head tremulousness, left-sided tingling and wooziness.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Benadryl, others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the Long-Term Monitoring Unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm and small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with one portion of the record demonstrating possible REM sleep. Sleep appears to be disrupted throughout the night with multiple arousals from sleep.
There are multiple push buttons throughout the day. The alarm makes an obnoxious sound, which can be heard, but the patient never seems to hear this sound.  Looking at the video, she doesnâ€™t seem to be pushing the button and is perhaps lying on the button.
No electrographic and no clinical seizures were identified.
HR:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal 24-hour video EEG recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Looking through the video, it is not possible to determine if this patient had one of her typical events during the recording.
