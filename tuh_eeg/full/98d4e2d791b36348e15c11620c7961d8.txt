History:	51 yo female with a hx of migraines (many years) increasing over the last month. R
sided scalp / behind R eye.described as a pressure, tingling. aggravated by lights. hx
of facial paralysis in 2002. ? Bell's Palsy., diabetes. normal ortho exam
Medications:	Fioricet, Percocet, Metformin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a low amplitude, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
was 102  T4 artifact seen almost continuously.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a limited NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
