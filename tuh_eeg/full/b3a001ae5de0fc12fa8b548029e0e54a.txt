CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old woman with seizures and episodes of unresponsiveness, noncompliant with seizure medications, questionable nonepileptic seizure versus epileptic
seizure followed by sedation following Ativan. The patient was intermittently awake, interactive, but nonverbal on the 19th. Known temporal lobe epilepsy with sharp waves identified on the left or the right.
MEDICATIONS: Potassium, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is markedly slow with
an expressed theta and delta. In sleep, there are POSTS identified on the left, but not the right. .Prominent in the sleep recording are right anterior temporal sharp waves. Arousal is associated with an increase in theta, but the background remains quite slow with arousal. In addition, there is beta asymmetry. There is a bit more beta on the right compared to the left. Discrete bilateral frontotemporal sharp waves are noted as well.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abdomen EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Right anterotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above have been previous reported for this
individual. The background slowing may be due to postictal state or medications. No seizures were recorded.
