CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old gentlemen admitted on the 13th with acute intracerebral hemorrhage on Coumadin. Hypothermic now with temperature 95.8.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Nicardipine, Pantoprazole, Hydralazine, Phenylephrine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The data can be re-reviewed with the ECS montage.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is suppressed. There is no change in the background with tactile stimulation. Electrode integrity is confirmed.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Absence of definitive cerebral activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Confirmation of this patient's body temperature is necessary, but at a temperature of 95, this EEG would be satisfactory for an assessment of electrocerebral inactivity.
