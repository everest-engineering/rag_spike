CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old male who has a history of post traumatic epilepsy, admitted on Friday with isolated language disorder which was different that his usual seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Lamictal, Lovenox, Lisinopril, Xalatan, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Frontal delta is observed.  There is also a fair amount of eye blink.  As the patient becomes drowsy with slow rolling eye movements, there is a mixture of subtle, lower voltage frontal theta delta. Minor asymmetries are noted in the background.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the left hemisphere is slightly slower than the right.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Some subtle, frontal mixed theta delta which can be distinguished from this patient's frequent eye blinks.
A subtle asymmetry as he drops off into a sleep with an overall slower pattern from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG in a week for this patient which did not identify epileptiform activity.  Additional EEG recording, perhaps capturing one of
his seizures may be important to characterize his epilepsy.
