History:	78 year old man presents after a fall, likely syncopal in etiology.  Patient is currently
agitated.  He is blind at baseline.  CT head showed small post-traumatic SAH.
Medications:	Keppra for seizure prophylaxis
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The background consists of low amplitude diffuse fast activity.  Patient is agitated throughout the
study, so intermittent movement artifact is captured.  During periods of quiescence, movement
artifact stops and occasional brief bursts of diffuse slow delta activity appear.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
regular heart rate at ~ 100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable 21-minute portable awake and briefly drowsy EEG. The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
