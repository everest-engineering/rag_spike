CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old gentleman admitted after a cluster of seizures with
slurred speech.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Zonisamide, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat fidgety.
There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes generous muscle
artifact. There is also diffuse beta. Prominent rhythmic theta is noted from the right
temporal region. Despite the artifacts described in this EEG, there does appear to be
some more rhythmic theta and some sharply contoured activity in the right mid and
central temporal regions.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Superimposed rhythmic theta with sharply contoured slowing in the right temporal
region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If additional information is needed, a repeat study in the
Lab is suggested. Alternatively a review of this patient's previous EEGs would be of use
.
