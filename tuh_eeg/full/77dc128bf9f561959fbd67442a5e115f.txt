History:	46 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SUDDEN ONSET OF LOSS OF
SHORT TERM MEMORY / CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS DUE TO HIGH
AMMONIA EVENT OCCURRED  7/2014
Medications:	ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE, ARIPIPRAZOLE, AMLODIPINE, ASPIRIN,
LOSARTAN, METOPROLOL, ATORVASTATIN, FUROSEMIDE, MULTI VIT W/IRON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild bifrontal
slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a minimal photic
driving response.  HR is 72.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of rare focal slowing in the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
