CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old female found down and unresponsive. Locked in state following multiple infarcts.
MEDICATIONS: Digoxin, Levalbuterol, Digoxin, Pantoprazole, SSI, CEFEPIME,
Coumadin, Metoprolol, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow and
disorganized with a pattern of rhythmic theta and delta. The initial sections of the record are significantly slower, but with stimulation there is eye opening and faster theta frequency activity. There were right occipital sharp waves. Particularly in the early portion of the record, there is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the posterior regions, right more so than the left.
HR: 110bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the previous study although
at the close of the record there is a bit more faster frequency activity.
