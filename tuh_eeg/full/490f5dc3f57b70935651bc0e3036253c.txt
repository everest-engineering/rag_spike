History:	66 year old woman with a long-standing history of seizures.
Medications:	"seizure" medications but patient cannot recall them.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The background consists of moderate amplitude somewhat monomorphic 7.5-8 Hz theta activity.
The AP gradient is very weak.  During brief drowsiness, there is attenuation of the waveforms
Subtle occasional polymorphic delta activity is observed over the left anterior temporal region,
seen most during drowsiness.  A single high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp wave with
aftergoing slow wave is captured.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F7/T1 electrode.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, one, left temporal, anterior, F7/T1 electrode maximally
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 22-minute EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization; (2) occasional moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing and (3) a single left
anterior temporal epileptiform discharge. Diffuse slowing and disorganization are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Left anterior temporal focal slowing and
a single left anterior temporal epileptiform discharge are suggestive of a potentially epileptogenic
focal structural cerebral abnormality over the left anterior temporal region.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
