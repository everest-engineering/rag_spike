CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with epilepsy which began a year ago.  Previous rehab treatment for alcohol abuse.  The patient has episodes of loss of consciousness with tongue-biting.  She started on Zoloft and Seroquel 2 years ago, in 2011, and had 6 more episodes following treatment with those medications but has been seizure-free in 2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medication is Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake through stage 2 sleep record for a drowsy patient who rapidly transitioned from wakefulness to sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was an 11-Hz alpha rhythm which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The patient transitioned in and out of stage 2 sleep with posts and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  There were no previous EEGs available for comparison.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of value.
