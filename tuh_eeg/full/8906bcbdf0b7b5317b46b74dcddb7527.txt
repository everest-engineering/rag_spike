History:	55 year old with a history of stroke and seizures.  Now he has been seizure-free for 2
years.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Intermittent brief 1-3 second bursts of monomorphic 6.5-7 Hz theta activity is present in the left
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing in frequency and duration during drowsiness.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal, bursts of monomorphic theta activity
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG due to intermittent mild left temporal
slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 56 bmp.
