MEDICATIONS:  Percocet.
HISTORY:  A 35-year-old right handed woman, with left-sided tingling 3-4 times per day, lasting 1-7 minutes for the last 30 days.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta with vertex waves noted in stage I sleep.
Hyperventilation produced a small amount of background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous driving response.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If this patient continues to have symptoms, additional recording may be of value.
