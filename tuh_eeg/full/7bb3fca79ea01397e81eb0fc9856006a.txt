History:	29 year old man with a history of 2 lifetime seizures.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also
seen.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 45-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
