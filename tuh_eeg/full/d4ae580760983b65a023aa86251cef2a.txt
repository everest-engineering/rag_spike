CLINICAL HISTORY:  30 year old right handed woman with history of chronic headaches and an episode of loosing consciousness about a year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Naproxen, Fioricet, Topamax, Propranolol.
REASON FOR EEG:  Headache and episode of loss of consciousness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Infrequent focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 and rarely at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At times over the left hemisphere they are sharply contoured and were consistent with wickets.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild focal cerebral dysfunction seen in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (left more than right), which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
