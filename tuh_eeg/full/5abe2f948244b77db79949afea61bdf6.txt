Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
