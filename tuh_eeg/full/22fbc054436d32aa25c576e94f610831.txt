CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with epilepsy since age 14, last seizure nearly a year ago, tonic-clonic seizures followed by postictal confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features or drowsiness are characterized by an increase in beta frequency activity. Photic stimulation elicits
scant bilateral driving.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG for this patient If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat sleep deprived record can be considered although this EEG last year did identify stage II sleep.
