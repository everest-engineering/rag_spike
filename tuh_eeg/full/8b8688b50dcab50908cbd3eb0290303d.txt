CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recurrent syncope with shaking, status post placement of a pacemaker.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Toradol, Xanax, oxycodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was recorded using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta.  In drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of shifting delta. In maximal wakefulness, the overall background is slightly disorganized.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm and occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
A small amount of background theta.
A few more bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity than anticipated for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Long term video EEG monitoring will follow.
