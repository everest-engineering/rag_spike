Medications:	KEPPRA, COLACE, MARINOL, VIT. D, NICOTINE PATCH, ASA, PRAVASTATIN,

Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eye
opening.  beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions with higher amplitude on
the right.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by vertex waves with higher amplitude on the right.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the right hemisphere most pronounced in
frontocentral region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is right parasagittal
breach rhythm.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present in the right parasagittal region, with
amplitude maximum at F4 and C4.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 65 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right
Breach artifact, right
Sharp waves, occasional, right central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
frontocentral region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  occasional
epileptiform discharges in the right frontocentral region.  These findings are indicative of a
potentially epileptogenic focus in this region.  No electrographic seizures are present.
