CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old right-handed male who has a history of epilepsy since 2007, has about 1 seizure every 1-2 years, presently not on any medications.  Last seizure was several nights ago.  The seizure was preceded by a severe headache.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  There was a technical limitation with the T6 electrode which persisted even after it was fixed by the technician.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz in frequency and 20-40 microvolts in amplitude best seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  In drowsiness there is diffuse rhythmic theta bursts in all the channels.

There is an occasional burst of focal slowing seen in the left frontocentral region.

Hyperventilation was performed which showed a diffuse slowing of the record and increase in amplitude.

Photic stimulation showed minimal driving at 13 Hz but no abnormalities.

Heart rate 60 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to occasional bursts of focal slowing on the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of a possible underlying structural abnormality in the left frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges were identified.  A more prolonged EEG recording may be more helpful to identify spikes or sharp waves.

Attestation: I personally reviewed the EEG with the trainee and agree with the report.
