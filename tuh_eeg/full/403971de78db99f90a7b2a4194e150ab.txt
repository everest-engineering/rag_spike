CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old woman with generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, anxiety, occipital neuralgia, and episodes with severe pain then shakiness, and blurry vision.  The patient is pregnant at this time.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin and others.
INTRODUCTION:  This is day 2 of continuous video EEG monitoring for a young adult.
During this section of the record the patient has a single, typical event and the boyfriend pushes the alarm at 8:18, but the symptoms are present at 8:07.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Drowsiness includes vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Stage II sleep is frequently disrupted with spontaneous arousals from sleep.
Event:  8:10 p.m. the patient is awake.  She lays on her left side.  She appears to be tearful with a headache.  Using the video, it is difficult to see twitching.  The spouse comforts the patient for about 10 minutes then pushes the seizure alarm.  A nurse comes and interviews the patient who is communicative.
Heart rate:  60-90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This 48-hour continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
A single, typical event for this patient which did not have an EEG correlate.
Somewhat limited video.  The patient does describe twitching which could not be seen on the video, but the remainder of the description of the event was similar to the patient's previous symptoms in terms of the pain and the preserved sensorium during the procedure.
