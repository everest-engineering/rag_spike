History:	55 YR MALE WITH CC OF RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS FOUND TO HAVE CVA.
PMHX:  ETOH ABUSE AND SZS.  PRIOR EEG.  NEEDED TO USE LTM MACHINE
Medications:	PROTONIX, ASA, HEPARIN,  LISINOPRIL, HYDRALAZINE PRN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep, Normal EEG

This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
