CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old with TBI and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, topiramate, and Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is a technically acceptable record.  The patient was unable to cooperate with hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is generous, low voltage frontocentral beta.  A breach rhythm is noted with accentuation of amplitude in the left hemisphere in comparison to the right.  This includes an increase in amplitude of the alpha frequency activity and increase in the beta as the patient becomes drowsy, and an overall amplitude increase.  As the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing is a bit more prominent in the left hemisphere with some underlying theta/delta noted from the left.  Other features of drowsiness include posts.
Rare left frontotemporal sharp waves can be differentiated from artifacts.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep, but did elicit a driving response bilaterally at faster frequencies.  Very brief stage 2 sleep is noted at the close of the record.
Heart rate 78 bmp.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
Subtle focal slowing from the left hemisphere with more rhythmic slowing noted in drowsiness.
Rare left frontotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing, breach rhythm, and rare sharp waves are in the region of this patient's previous cranial defect.  No seizures were identified.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.
