CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy on Dilantin with subtherapeutic levels (undetectable) and 6-8 seizures in the past month.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl, prednisone, Symbicort, phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  Introduction digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is primarily an awake EEG with photic stimulation.   Hyperventilation was deferred.  The patient was very restless with continuous movements through out.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In wakefulness, the patient has lambda waves. The overall background is somewhat disorganized in wakefulness, but as the patient becomes a bit more relaxed and transitions into drowsiness, hypnagogic hypersynchrony was noted.
In this technically challenging EEG, there are subtle asymmetries.   These include rare focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly the temporal region which can be differentiated from artifact.  On one or 2 occasions there is a suggestion of disruption of faster frequency activity in the left posterior region, but there is a great deal of artifact in that region.  Rare left temporal sharp waves were noted.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  To more completely evaluate this patient's epileptiform pattern, a more prolonged tracing capturing sleep may be of value.  In addition, relaxation methods might facilitate better recording
