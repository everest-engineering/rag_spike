CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed gentleman admitted on the 27th with altered mental status, inappropriate behavior, history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, stroke, and TIA.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Insulin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG includes a mixture of theta and delta.  There is little in the way of a posterior dominant rhythm.  Features of sleep include spindles and a handful of vertex waves.  Photic stimulation serves to awaken the patient and increase both the beta and theta, but there is no definitive driving response.

HR:    96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Paucity of some of the normal wave forms anticipated in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function effecting gray and white matter.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered.
