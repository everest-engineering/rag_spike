CLINICAL HISTORY:  23 year old right handed male with epilepsy, seizure free since 2009, history of postictal agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG in wakefulness demonstrates a primarily diffuse beta pattern.  The patient seems to be very anxious during the EEG.  There is a great deal of muscle movement and eye movement.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving. At the close of the record, there is a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with an alpha supraharmonic of 20 Hz.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Prominent beta.
An alpha supraharmonic.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG contrasts to a 2009 study which demonstrated 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity and a tonic-clonic convulsion.  Given the past EEG which demonstrated a seizure, this patient may have been particularly anxious this
study.  A follow-up study may be of value to more completely evaluate the generalized spike and wave activity seen 3 years ago.
