CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old male with epilepsy with seizures since 2008.

MEDICATIONS:  Magnesium Oxide, ASA, Metoprolol, Enalapril, HCTZ, Keppra

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage with 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:    78 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second normal EEG for this adult.  If further characterization of his epilepsy is important, a follow up study capturing more extended sleep is suggested.
