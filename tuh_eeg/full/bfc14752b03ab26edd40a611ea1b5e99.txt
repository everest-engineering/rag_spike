CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 67-year-old female with history of epilepsy and depression who presents for followup.  Her last seizure was more than 2 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 7-7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness was characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute with arrhythmia.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The general clinical correlation was recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures are identified in this record.  Note that the patient has arrhythmia.
