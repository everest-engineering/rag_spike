History:	42 Y/O RH FEMALE AT THE TIME WAS 8 MONTH PREGNANT. WHILE SITTING
ON THE SOFA HUSBAND DESCRIBED THAT SHE STARTED TO SHAKE AND
BECAME UNRESPONSIVE, FOAMING FROM THE MOUTH EYE ROLLING TAKEN
TO ED. AT THAT TIME SHE HAD AN MRI AND SHOWS WHITE LESIONS
Medications:	NO AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 11 to 13 fps.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
