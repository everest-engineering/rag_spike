History:	18 year old man with a history of a recent GSW to the left hemisphere, status post
craniotomy.  Patient had an acute change in his mental status today, concerning for
subclinical seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Morphine PRN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The
background over the right consists of 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity posteriorly with expected AP gradient.
The background over the left consists of fragmented polymorphic 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly with
weak AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Theta and delta activity is
especially pronounced over the left temporal region and  left posterior quadrant.  During
drowsiness, there is increase in theta activity diffusely.
No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left, temporal and posterior quadrant region
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 23-minute portable EEG due to focal mild left
hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the left temporal region and posterior
quadrant. This finding is indicative of a focal structural cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology and is consistent with patient's history of left hemispheric GSW and craniotomy.  The lack
of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
