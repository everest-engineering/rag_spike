LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man who had a single convulsion on 01/28/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Not known.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  EKG artifact is noted throughout the recording.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 21-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
