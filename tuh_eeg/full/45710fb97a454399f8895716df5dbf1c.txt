CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 88-year-old woman with diabetes and possible stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix and atorvastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern.  The patient tends to be quite drowsy, drifting off to sleep.  With stimulation, an arousal pattern is noted with 7.5 Hz activity in the background and a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hz.  In wakefulness, there are intermittent bursts of shifting irregular delta, but the overall awake pattern is one a diffuse of modestly slow background.
Heart rate irregular, 66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Somewhat poor organization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are nonspecific, but it can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  If additional information is needed, a followup study as an outpatient may be helpful to exclude seizures..
