CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 18 -year-old male with new onset tonic clonic seizures after development of a sore throat on March 14, 2013.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient seemed to be very sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, there was a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm but the patient rapidly transitioned from wakefulness into stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.  Hyperventilation was attempted but the patient drifted back into sleep.  With stimulation, occasional alpha squeak was noted.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.  Photic stimulation also served to alert the patient.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This individual demonstrated excessive drowsiness, rapidly drifting into stage II sleep.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
