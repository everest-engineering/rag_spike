INTRODUCTION
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10â•–20
electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes . The patient
was recorded in wakefulness and sleep. Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES
None.
DESCRIPTION OF The record
opens to a well defined posterior
dominant rhythm of 9Hz which is reacted to eye opening and normal frontal central
beta seen. Sleep stage 1 is seen. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal
discharges.
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves.
None.
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves.
This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in
the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No
epileptiform discharges were seen.
