History:	88 YO FEMALE PRESENTS S/P FALL. BILATERAL SDH S/P EVACUATION. PT
HAD ? SZ AT 6 AM 10/02/2015. PMH: STROKE 6/2014 AND LEFT EYE
NEUROBLASTOMA AT AGE 5.
Medications:	KEPPRA, INSULIN, ZOSYN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta/theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. Best seen over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontocentral region during with mild
attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere. At times the focal slowing is sharply
countoured.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontocentral region with
severe attenuation of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 90 irregular and frequent PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral frontal
Attenuation, continuous, bilateral (R>L) frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing and attenuation in the in the
bilateral hemispheres but mainly frontocentral region (right more than left).  This finding is
indicative of a focal structural lesion in these regions, consistent with the known subdurals.   In
addition there is marked diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of marked diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
