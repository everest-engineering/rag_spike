CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old woman with morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes,
heart failure, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea found down with acute renal failure.
MEDICATIONS: Risperidone, Metoprolol, Cardizem, Zocor, Aspirin, Divalproex,
Heparin, Synthroid, Pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is resting quietly, the overall
pattern includes a theta frequency pattern with some alpha frequency activity in the
central regions. Stimulation of the patient produces some muscle artifact There is an
alerting response. Features of stage I sleep include vertex waves. There are some
minor amplitude asymmetries in the frontal central regions and vertex waves in this
bedside portable critical care recording. Vertex waves are slightly asymmetric and a bit
more prominent on the left.
HR: 120bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Questionable asymmetric vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this bedside recording, the asymmetry in the vertex
waves could be due to head measurement artifact rather than a true CNS pathology.
Evaluation as this patient recovers and leaves the ICU Is appropriate and an additional
recording may be needed.
