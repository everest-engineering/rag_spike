History:	62 year old man who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	No sedation or seizure meds.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, drowsy,
asleep, lethargic
Description:
Patient is asleep through the majority of the recording.  With stimulation the background changes
to low amplitude diffuse ~ 10 Hz activity with underriding beta activity and 3-10 sec bursts of non-
evolving diffuse moderate amplitude monomorphic 4 Hz activity.  For the majority of the recording,
the background is attenuated and consists of diffuse beta activity admixed with symmetrical sleep
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2, nearly for the entire recording
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and mostly asleep portable 22-minute EEG due to diffuse
background slowing. This finding is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this patient, is at least partially related to excessive drowsiness, given the fact
that patient cannot remain alert for any appreciable period of time.  No electrographic seizures are
present.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
