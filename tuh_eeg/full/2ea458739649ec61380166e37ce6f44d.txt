CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old right handed woman with adult onset epilepsy, occasional auras.
MEDICATIONS:   Gabitril, Zyrtec, Neurontin, Crestor, Esomeprazole Magnesium
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is prominent temporal wicket.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of shifting, right or left temporal arrhythmic delta activity with the wicket.  There are some bursts that look like after an going slow wave, but without a definitive sharp wave or spike.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the shifting right or left temporal slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:     66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slightly slow alpha rhythm.
Prominent shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only one previous EEG was available for comparison, which was a study from 2 years ago in which I identified the same features, but also
right temporal sharp waves.  To more completely characterize this patient's epileptiform activity, a study with stage II sleep is suggested.
