CLINICAL HISTORY:  Epilepsy, currently seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS:   Lamictal, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 38-year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy, current seizureÂ­
free.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard
10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation. This is an awake through stage II sleep record in an individual who is very drowsy.
In maximum wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm. Vertex waves are noted in sleep, as are post.
Hyperventilation produces a small degree of background slowing. The patient is falling asleep in photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits but excessively drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are noted. The excessive drowsiness can be due to sleep deprivations, medications or a warm environment.
