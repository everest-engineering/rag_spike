CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with a grand mal seizure December 2012 characterized by eyes rolling back, foaming at the mouth.  The patient's most recent seizure was 1 week ago.



MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Xanax, Elavil, doxepin.



INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.



TECHNICAL ISSUES:  Impedances were satisfactory, but there is a fair amount of muscle artifact and the patient seemed jittery while awake.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is a bit slower at 7.5 Hz but with stimulation it reaches 10 Hz.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Generous beta was noted in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Wicket was noted as the patient transitioned into sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.



Hyperventilation produced a small amount of slowing.



Heart rate 72 beats per minute.



IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The excess beta may be due to this patient's medications.  The excess muscle may be associated with shivering in this cold environment or nervousness.
