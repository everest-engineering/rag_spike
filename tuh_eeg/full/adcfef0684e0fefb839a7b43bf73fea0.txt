CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed woman status post left frontal resection with ongoing seizures with secondary generalization.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra, Zenchent, Vimpat
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the record begins the patient is asleep and then
transitions towards hyperventilation. There is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. A breech rhythm is identified in the left frontal central region with an accentuation of faster frequency activity in this region. There is also a discrete C3 sharp wave noted in this region. The overall background demonstrates some degree of disorganization and a small amount of excess frontal central theta. The patient transitions in and out of sleep rapidly. Photic stimulation is performed as she is drifting off to sleep, but there does appear to be a brief driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta in the frontal central regions bilaterally.
2. Intermittent focal slowing from the left frontal central region.
3. Left central sharp waves.
4. Occasional paroxysmal bursts of bilateral slowing in apparent wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breech rhythm is an anticipated finding following
craniotomy. The left frontal central focal slowing and sharp waves are in the region of her previous surgery. No sustained seizures were noted. These findings are similar to previous studies.
