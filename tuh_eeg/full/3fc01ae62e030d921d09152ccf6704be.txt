CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old woman with epilepsy, anxiety, depression and left sided numbness.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Doxepin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Abnormal CT scan with frontal encephalomalacia, theta and shifting arrhythmic delta activity. The arrhythmic delta activity is seen in the posterior regions and is a bit slower in the right posterior region than the left. In the right hemisphere, delta at times can be posterior or anterior with occasional bursts of frontal delta. In the transition to sleep, the arrhythmic delta activity becomes a little bit more prominent in tile central regions and a somewhat asymmetric vertex wave starts to emerge. There are sections of the record with a bit more rhythmic theta activity and a bit better organization. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in diffuse disorder of cerebral function effecting gray and white matter. No epileptiform features were seen.
