History:	61 year old man who presents with transient left sided weakness.
Medications:	Protonix, ASA, Heparin, Atorvastatin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  AP gradient is weak.  Frequent 50-75uV, 4-7Hz waves are
interspersed throughout the recording.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No focal slowing
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.
