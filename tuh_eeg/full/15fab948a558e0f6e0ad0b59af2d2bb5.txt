CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old woman with unknown early developmental history, posttraumatic stress syndrome, depression, past history of suicidal ideation, past history of involuntary jerking.  Now, patient reports headaches if she becomes anxious are associated with shaking, incontinence, or tongue biting every 2-4 weeks.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Trileptal, Xanax, Claritin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  It was a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Mu rhythm was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving with vigorous supra-harmonic driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In contrast to a previous EEG 2 years ago, there were no bursts of 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  If this patient is thought to have frequent seizures, more prolonged EEG monitoring may be obtained.  These findings may be carefully correlated with clinical symptoms in this individual, whose previous EEG pattern suggested that she is at risk for myoclonic or tonic-clonic epilepsy.
