History:	73 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH SYNCOPE ON 10/24/14 PT AWOKE IN THE AM ON THE FLOOR WITH NO RECALL OF EVENT. DENIES B/B INCONT, CP . PT NOTED WITH AURAL HEMATOMA ON LT SIDE MOST LIKELY FROM FALL. PMHX SIG FOR CEA OF LT 2008, CAD S/P CABG 1998 , PCI 2006, TIA
Medications:	INSULIN, TRAZODONE, METOPROLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by an alpha rhythm that at best reaches 8.5-9Hz. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. Intermittent brief bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal polymorphic 1 to 2 Hz, 80-100 uV slow waves are observed during wakefulness. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR was 84

Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of diffuse background slowing and FIRDA. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
