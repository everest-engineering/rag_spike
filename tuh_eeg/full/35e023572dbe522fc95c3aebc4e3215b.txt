History: 67 YO FEMALE THAT FELL 2X OUT OF BED WHILE SLEEPING SINCE APRIL 2014. PT DOES NOT RECALL ANYTHING BUT WAKING ON THE FLOOR.PMHX: SUBDURAL HEMATOMA, HTN, DM2, GERD,ASTHMA, ANXIETY, HYPERLIPIDEMIA,HYPOTHYROIDISM
Medications: TOPIRAMATE, LEVETIRACETAM, NEURONTIN, METOPROLOL DIAZEPAM, FLEXERIL XANAX,AND OTHERS IN FILE
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. No sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR 60

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Excessive fast, continuous diffuse

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. ·If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
