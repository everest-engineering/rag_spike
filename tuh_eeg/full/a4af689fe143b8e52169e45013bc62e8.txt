History:	67 year old man with a history of strokes, alcohol abuse and reported staring
episodes that are associated with drooling and confusion.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient rapidly transitions in-and-out of sleep.
There is an asymmetry of background amplitude posteriorly that is >50%. Voltages are attenuated
over the left occipital leads.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Heart rate of <60 bpm is noted on a
single EKG lead.  Additionally, there is prominent continuous EKG artifact in T5 lead.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Voltage attenuation, nearly continuous, left occipital
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 21-minute EEG due to voltage attenuation over
the left occipital leads. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  The lack
of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
