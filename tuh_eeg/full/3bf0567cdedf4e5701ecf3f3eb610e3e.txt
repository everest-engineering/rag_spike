History:	50 year old woman with a history of seizures, who desires to stop seizure
Medications:	None listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 7-9 Hz theta activity.
The AP gradient is poor.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  Symmetrical sleep
spindles and K-complexes are captured.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is present over the left anterior temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rat e <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, anterior, mild-to-moderate
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 28 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
occasional focal mild-to-moderate left anterior temporal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild  diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in
origin.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rat e <60 bpm.
