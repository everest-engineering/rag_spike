CLINICAL HISTORY:  s/p code, for hypothermic protocol
MEDICATIONS:  Norepinephrine, propofol, vancomycin, piperacillin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  The patient received hypothermia treatment during this section of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a technically somewhat challenging record initially with a lower voltage, slow pattern with generous muscle.  Over the course of the record, by 10 p.m., the EEG is low voltage and suppressed and then transitioned over time to a burst suppression pattern with brief bursts of theta frequency activity.  The bursts are 3-5 seconds in duration and periods of suppression, may be 20 seconds or longer.
By 4 a.m., the hypothermia treatment had been discontinued and the patient was rewarmed.  The EEG continues to demonstrate a burst suppression pattern with asynchrony, at times more activity in one hemisphere than the other.  In addition, sharply contoured delta is emerging with maximum at T2 or independently at 71.
The overall pattern remained markedly low voltage relatively suppressed and not reactive to tactile stimuli.
Over the course of the 26, the patient's propofol drip was adjusted.  The patient continued to demonstrate a burst suppression pattern, although by 11 a.m., there are more sharp waves emerging from either hemisphere.  The epileptiform activity that emerges is quite blunted, but does occur in brief bursts.
Heart rate 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Initially very suppressed pattern.
A later pattern, which was a burst suppression pattern.
With re-warming and reduction of medications, the pattern with more significant sharp waves, which was emerging.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are compatible with a severe anoxic encephalopathy, congruent with the clinical examination and imaging findings.
