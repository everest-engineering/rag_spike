AGE: 69 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/28/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1858
HISTORY:
69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, OM presenting with right sided weakness, found to have a. right MCA acute infarct, now with fluctuations in mental status, anemia, and AKI.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ, AMLODIPINE, COREG SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a
fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and further diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured
Mild generalized slowing is present.
There is occasional subtle left temporal and independent occasional subtle right temporal polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
An irregular heart rate in the 60's is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy	routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization
Occasional subtle left temporal polymorphic slowing
Independent occasional subtle right temporal polymorphic slowing
Irregular heart rate
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of bitemporal cerebral dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. An irregular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.
