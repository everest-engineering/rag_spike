CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman status post PCA and left pontine stroke on February 18, 2013, who was on rehab on February 22, 2013, doing well when she began having difficulty with speech, became lethargic and unresponsive.  She was taken to the hospital for a CT and demonstrated large intraparenchymal hemorrhage extension and midline shift.  Now for a brain death exam.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, gentamicin, phenytoin.

REASON FOR THE STUDY:  Brain death.

INTRODUCTION:  Brain death protocol EEG is performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  No activating procedures were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is reviewed using the electrocerebral silence montage in relation to 2 microvolt sensitivity and reveals no normal electrocerebral activity throughout the entire recording.  The electrodes were checked during the recording as per the brain death protocol.  No state changes, posterior dominant rhythm or activating procedures were performed.

Heart rate 76.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to lack of normal electrocerebral activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the electrical diagnosis of brain death.
