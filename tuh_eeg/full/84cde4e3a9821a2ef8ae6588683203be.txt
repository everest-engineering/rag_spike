History:	76 YR MALE WITH HTN, ADRENAL INSUF, CHF, COPD, AFIB, CHF, ETOH ABUSE
CC OF CHANGE IN MS
Medications:	LOVENOX, ASA, SERAX, DIGOXIN, METOPROLOL, SEROQUEL, KEPPRA,
PROTONIX. ATIVAN (YESTERDAY)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
Posterior dominant rhythm reaches at best 8hz seen best over the left hemisphere.  Background
activity was mildly disorganized with diffuse excessive theta activity. However at times there is a
more normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior
temporal region.  Independent Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left
midtemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 72 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal
in the anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region
and consistent with the known stroke. In addition there is evidence of independent  left
midtemporal focal cerebral dysfunction and mild  diffuse background slowing.These findings are
etiologically nonspecific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
