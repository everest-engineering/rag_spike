CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 74-year-old woman who had a syncopal spell January 13. She found herself on the floor, amnestic for the event.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This was an awake and drowsy record in a patient who appeared to be very drowsy although with stimulation, was able to answer questions appropriately.
In most of the EEG, the alpha rhythm reaches only 8 Hz. There is excess theta and a small amount of disorganization The patient transitions in and out of a drowsy state with intermittent features of stage I and stage II sleep including vertex waves. The patient arouses out of drowsy state.
Photic stimulation did not active the record.
Heart rate 114 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Hypersomnolence.
Tachycardia.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. The background slowing and disorganization is a nonspecific finding and may be correlated with clinical history and imaging. Additional evaluation for the rapid heart rate may be appropriate.
