LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old man who had a seizure 4 months ago characterized by loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient does not recall.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes.  Hyperventilation was not performed because the patient refused.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No sleep is captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal, awake only, 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persistent, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
