CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old with past history of meningitis while traveling in Columbia, severe brain injury, nearly vegetative state; chronically with PEG, trach, and ventilated or oxygenated.  One of his nurses was concerned that he might be having seizures characterized by head bobbing.  Father is quite definitive that the patient is not having clinical seizures at this time, but does suffer with spasticity.
MEDICATIONS:   Zonegran, Klonopin, Mysoline, Carnitor, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was awake, somewhat interactive, trached, ventilated and with eye movement.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a low voltage, relatively continuous pattern with a low voltage delta and theta.  There is prominent beta.  The patient has multiple craniotomy defects and a breach rhythm with C4 sharp waves noted in the background, otherwise remarkable for significant muscle and beta.  Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  87 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, relatively featureless pattern.
Focal slowing in the context of a breach rhythm at C4.
Occasional C4 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This is a technically challenging record for the patient with asymmetric eye movements.  None of the patient's involuntary movements today were seizures.
