HISTORY: A 57-year-old woman with adult onset refractory nocturnal convulsions.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra and OXC on hold, Zonisamide

INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring Is performed In the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG and seizure spike detection software. Technically acceptable despite some challenges. No clinical seizures were noted during this section of the record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Is somewhat disorganized. There Is overall excess theta and beta A posterior dominant rhythm was noted.

In comparison to previous sections of the record, there is a little less in the way of epileptiform activity. but epileptiform activity seems to be primarily in the right frontal or temporal region.

Heart rate; 72 bpm.

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This section of 24 hour EEG monitoring was remarkable for:

1. No definitive seizures.
2. A disorganized background.
3. R FT sharps, T2 maximum but frontal involvement
Additional days of EEG will be recorded to capture seizures.
