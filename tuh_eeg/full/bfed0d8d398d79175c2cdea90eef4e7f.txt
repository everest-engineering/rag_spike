REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of loss of conscious.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman with a history of nocturnal seizures and incontinence with recent evidence of loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact and T4 temporal muscle artifact is seen intermittently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate 76.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of right mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is not specific in regard to the etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
