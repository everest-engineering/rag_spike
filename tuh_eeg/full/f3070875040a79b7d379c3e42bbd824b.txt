CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 37-year-old male admitted with recurrent seizures.  Symptoms characterized by ataxia and truncal rigidity.  Past history of fused fontanelle, viral meningitis in 1982, and headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, tramadol, and oxycodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Twenty-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite tense during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a 9.5 hertz, 30-microvolt posterior dominant rhythm was accompanied by a modest amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Intermittent, involuntary jerking was noted during the EEG particularly as the patient became drowsy.  This was a truncal jerk, which produced some artifact and then arousal.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and did not significantly activate at the record.  Following hyperventilation, additional jerking of the right shoulder did not produce any artifact in the EEG.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Of note, this patient's intermittent involuntary jerking was not associated with epileptiform activity.
