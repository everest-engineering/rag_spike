system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation and completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, followed
