CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 26-year-old male with paroxysmal episodes of vertigo and a feeling of depersonalization as well as intermittent sharp headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Truvada, Norvir, Prezista, Symbicort, aspirin, and Singulair.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous in quantity of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is some hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.  There are rare bursts of shifting and slowing noted as the patient transitions into sleep, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is at the limits of normal for a subject of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG without epileptiform activity for this individual.  In this particular EEG, there is minimal isolated temporal slowing in the transition to sleep, at the limits of the range of normal, but certainly not supportive of any specific process.
