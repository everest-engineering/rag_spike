CLINICAL HISTORY:  Admitted today  following clusters of refractory seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, phenobarbital, lacosamide, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  A seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  This EEG captured wakefulness and sleep.  No clinical seizures were noted by the care team.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate a primarily drowsy patient.  The overall activity is reasonably well organized from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere initially does not demonstrate an alpha rhythm and there are bursts of arrhythmic delta activity with a broad field of spread within the left hemisphere including left central, posterior temporal, and occipital regions.
Epileptiform activity is most prominent in the initial sections of the record with phase reversals, which may be left mid to posterior temporal or posterior parietal.
Sleep is characterized by additional paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic slowing from the left hemisphere, some of which were sharply contoured.
By the afternoon of the 22nd, the patient is more consistently awake and alert with alpha identifiable at times bilaterally.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This initial 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
An overall improvement of the background with an increase in the awake state and an increase in alpha frequency activity.
A decrease in the paroxysmal bursts of paroxysmal slowing.
Epileptiform activity from the left temporal region, but with variability and variable spread including occipitoparietal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Overall, this section of the record demonstrates an improvement of the epileptiform activity.  No seizures were identified.
