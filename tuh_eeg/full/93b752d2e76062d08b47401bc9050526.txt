RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The waking record remains devoid of epileptiform activity.  The background is well organized with symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  The epileptiform activity is seen primarily in stage II sleep, which is the primary sleep state that is recorded.  With the use of additional frontal and frontal polar montages, the activity continues to localize to the frontal regions and the vast majority of it is symmetric, at the midline, rare slightly higher amplitude poly spike component on the right, but there are occasional discharges that are a bit more prominent on the left.  The onset of the epileptiform activity is identical in both hemispheres and is coincident with the activity at the midline.
HR:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal continuous video EEG monitoring due to:
Frontally predominant spike and slow wave and poly spike and slow wave activity identified almost exclusively in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The differential diagnosis for this pattern is  primary generalized epilepsy versus frontal lobe focus.  Noe seizures were recorded.
