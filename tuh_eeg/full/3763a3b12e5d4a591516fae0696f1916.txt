History:	30 year old woman with a history of epilepsy since 17 years of age, who continues
to have 3-4 seizures per week.
Medications:	Depakote (patient reports non-compliance)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently noted.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
observed.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excess beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
