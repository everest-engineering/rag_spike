History:	64 YEAR OLD MAN RH PMHX OF ASTHMA. PT SAYS HE HAS AN AURA
SENSATION SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN DOES NOT HAVE LOC, BUT HAS HAD
THIS 15 YEARS.
Medications:	Albuterol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness and drowsiness.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F8/T4.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, right temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 Hour awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of very frequent focal
slowing and frequent epileptiform discharges in the right anterior temporal region.  These findings
are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal lesion.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
