CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed man admitted to the Neurology Service with an episode of difficulty speaking and increasing right hemiparesis. The patient reports that he is still not back to baseline. Past history of stroke, renal failure, head and neck cancer, lung cancer.

MEDICATIONS: Plavix, Renagel, Lisinopril, Senna

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized. In addition, there is a bit of arrhythmic delta activity seen intermittently in the left hemisphere and subtle left temporal sharp waves which are best seen in a referential montage. Sharply contoured left delta is also observed. Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing in the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving, which is subtle but better represented on the right.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Focal slowing in the left temporal region.
3. Left temporal sharp wave.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance effecting gray and white matter. The presence of epileptiform activity suggests a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
