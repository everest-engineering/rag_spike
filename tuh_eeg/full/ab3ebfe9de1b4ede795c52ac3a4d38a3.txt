AGE: 38 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/17/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1684
HISTORY:
38 y.o. male with a history of two lifetime convulsions and additionally smaller episodes with difficulty speaking, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily. lisinopril (PRINIVIL,ZESTRIL) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth daily.
omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily. phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 100 mg by mouth 3 times daily. 3 caps am 2 caps hs
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11-12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities .
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep one-hour EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and asleep one-hour EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
