CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 12, tonic-clonic seizures followed by confusion, depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, topiramate, others.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low-to-medium amplitude with a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and abundant, low voltage, frontal central beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  One-hour digital video EEG monitoring was remarkable for;
Generous beta.
The absence of epileptiform activity.
Inability to record deeper stages of sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG for this adult, this study differs from the previous 20-minute EEG and that we were unable to capture deeper stages of sleep.  In addition, there is generous beta noted today.  This might reflect anxiety or the use of medications that can produce beta.
