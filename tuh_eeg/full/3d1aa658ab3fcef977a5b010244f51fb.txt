CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male with new onset seizures with a family history of
aneurysm and possible abnormality in right temporal lobe. New onset seizures in late
summer 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Spiriva, Diflucan, Bactrim, Zithromax, Ranitidine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE In wakefulness, the background EEG includes
generous beta with a low voltage 11 Hz alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include
the appearance of temporal wicket as well as an increase in the beta described above.
Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. If additional
information is needed, a more prolonged study capturing stage II sleep is suggested.
