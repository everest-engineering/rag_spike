CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old male with renal failure, 2 failed treatments, March 3, 2013, on hemodialysis.  The patient had an episode of confusion which was thought to be related to medications.  Past history of stroke and obstructive sleep apnea.
MEDICATIONS:  Prograf, Cellcept, Dilaudid, Prednisone
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  The patient had frequent hiccups.  Impedances were acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow, disorganized, and asymmetric.  There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left, which is disrupted on the right.  Arrhythmic delta activity is noted in the right hemisphere with variable maximum including right central, temporal, and para-sagittal regions.  In addition, there are bursts of shifting slowing noted.  Intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta were identified.
As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a decrease in muscle and an increase in slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 116 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
Focal slowing with an asymmetry with greater delta on the right.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are congruent with atoxic or metabolic encephalopathy, in addition to a structural abnormality on the right.  No epileptiform features were identified.
