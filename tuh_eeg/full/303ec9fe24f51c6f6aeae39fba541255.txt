CONTINUATION
CLINICAL HISTORY:
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the long term monitoring unit using seizure and spike detection.  Throughout this 24-hour period the patient continued to have episodes of right face and arm twitching.  These were stimulus sensitive and were not noted when then patient was sleeping.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness and sleep there is a pattern of periodic left occipital parietal spiking with a generous field of spread.  Arrhythmic was noted of the left hemisphere.  The right hemisphere is somewhat slow as well, but by the afternoon of October 9, 2012 there is an increase in both alpha and theta frequency activity on the right.
During this section of the record the patient receives phenobarbital.  Clinically, the jerking is not as prominent.  Electrographically no significant change is noted in the spiking on the left which now is sometimes picked up in the right occipital parietal region.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
