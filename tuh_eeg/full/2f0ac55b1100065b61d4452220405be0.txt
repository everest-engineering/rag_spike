History:	42 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES.  PER PT LAST GTC OVER 2 YRS
AGO.  BUT HAD 2 EPISODES OF BLACKOUT AFTER LEAVING ED ON 11/12/14.
SHE STATED TOOK MEDS A LITTLE LATE.  WHEN MEDS LATE ONLY TIME
SHE HAS BLACKOUT.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal temporal region.  Occasional focal
sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Has was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the
left fronto temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left fronto temporal  region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
