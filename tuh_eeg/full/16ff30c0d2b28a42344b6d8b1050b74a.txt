CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old left handed woman with migraine headaches and
confusional spells.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz, 20 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta
activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of theta and this appeared to be alpha
rhythm. Stage 2 sleep included vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. Photic
stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively drowsy and does not activate the
record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features. Normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. A low voltage EEG is a normal finding.
