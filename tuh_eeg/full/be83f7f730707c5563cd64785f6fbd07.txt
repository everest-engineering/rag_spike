AGE: 46 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 10/12/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : ICU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Asleep only EEG #: 15-1497
HISTORY:
46 y.o. female with a history of seizures (1998), presenting with a metabolic encephalopathy and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS: ALBUMIN , METOLAZONE, RIFAXIMIN, FUROSEMIDE
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background consists of a disorganized mixture of mostly delta with admixed theta . There is no clear reactivity to noxious stimulation, nor is there definite variability or state change.
Eye blink artifact is seen during noxious stimulation.
Severe generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES : There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli .
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed .
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed .
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:
Severe generalized slowing, with lack of definite reactivity
Background disorganization
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
