CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old right handed woman, admitted with aphasia and multiple, recurrent, spells of confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Hydralazine, Pantoprazole, Atropine, Insulin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record for a confused individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The activity in the right hemisphere is well organized with a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates disruption of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic 4-6 Hz activity out of the left hemisphere and a little bit of arrhythmic activity in the left central parietal region.
HR:    60 bpm and irregular with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing on the left hemisphere characterized by disruption of the alpha rhythm and rhythmic left temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or sharp waves were identified.  The rhythmic theta identified in the left hemisphere may be an interictal phenomenon.
