Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates and can
be best seen over the left hemisphere.   5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present and can only be seen
on the left hemisphere.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Again this patterns can only be seen over the right hemisphere.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal  sharp waves are present in the with
phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F8 and FP2.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, few, right frontal, Pre frontal and frontal
Attenuation, continuous, right hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake 42 minute EEG because of rare epileptiform discharges in the left
pre-frontal and frontal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region. In addition, the  intermittent focal slowing and continuous attenuation in the left
hemisphere region.  This finding is indicative of focal  structural cerebral dysfunction involving gray
