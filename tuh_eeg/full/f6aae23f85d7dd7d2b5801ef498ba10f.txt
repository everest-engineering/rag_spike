CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 68-year-old woman with seizure and then postictal impairment of awareness on November 20th.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, metoprolol, vancomycin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Patient is poorly cooperative during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized.  With stimulation, the patient alerts with an increase in theta and a glimpse of an alpha rhythm.  When unstimulated, bursts of rhythmic, frontal delta were noted.
Heart rate, irregular, 104 bpm with frequent PVCs
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Poor organization.
Frontal irregular rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  The pattern described above is nonspecific, but is typical of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as may be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
