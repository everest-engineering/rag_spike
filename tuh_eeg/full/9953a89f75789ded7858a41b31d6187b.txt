History:	63 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O TEMPORAL LOBE EPILEPSY SINCE
1966. SEIZURES BEGIN WITH AN AURA OF A ADRENALINE RUSH FEELING.
LAST SZ ON 3/10/14. PT REPORTS 3-4 SZ IN THE LAST YEAR.
Medications:	LAMICTAL, VIMPAT, KLONOPIN, IBUPROFEN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing was seen.  One high voltage, left anterior temporal spike was seen during photic
stimulation.  Four low voltage right temporal sharp waves were seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces rhythmic,
shifting slowing in the temporal regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) induces symmetric photic driving. One high voltage, left anterior temporal spike was seen, as
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, one, left temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, rare, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The independent, bilateral temporal
epileptiform discharges support the patient's diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy.
