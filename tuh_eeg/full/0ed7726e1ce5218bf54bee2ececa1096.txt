CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old right handed female who has a 1 to 2 day history of exacerbation of complex partial seizures. The patient began to have episodes of confusion. She was identifying abnormal visual phenomenon on the 29th. By 8/30/2010 and 8/31/2010, she was having staring spells and presented to the emergency room on 9/1/2010, with recurrent complex partial seizures of which she was aware. She was often aware that she was staring during the seizures and was briefly confused.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Carbamazepine, Diltiazem, Atenolol,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is initially awake and then somewhat drowsy following the use of sedative hypnotic medications. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is not having a seizure, but she starts to have repetitive partial complex seizures out of the right temporal region why rhythmic, 4 Hz to 5Hz activity. Initially there is a break between the seizures which are about
110 seconds in duration but as the recording continues, the seizures start, stop and have not completely stopped before she generates into the last seizure. The EEG ends at 4:07:02, at which point she has stopped having seizures but she has some rhythmic sharp wave contoured activity in the right mid to posterior temporal region.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal complex partial status epilepticus.
2. Right temporal focal slowing.
3. Mild slowing from the left.
CORRELATION: Long term video EEG monitoring was initially edited based in these findings.
