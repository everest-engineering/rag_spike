CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, dizziness and
Impaired memory. Four tonic-clonic seizures 7/20/2010, and 2 seizures 8/10/2010, in
wakefulness.
MEDICATIONS: Paroxetine, Buspirone, Oxcarbazepine, Hydrochlorothiazide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 1 0.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a generous amount of low. voltage, frontocentral beta activity and scant background
theta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces an
increase in theta. Wicket is noted as the patient drifts off to sleep. Photic stimulation
elicits driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Minimal excess theta.
CLINICAL Correlation: This patient medications may produce the theta described
above. This is the third EEG without epileptiform activity. If epilepsy is an important
consideration, a follow-up study or a prolonged study capturing her events is suggested.
