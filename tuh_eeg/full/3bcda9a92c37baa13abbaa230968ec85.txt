History:	54 year old woman with extensive PMH now presents with reported shaking events.
Medications:	Neurontin, Perphentin-Amitriptyline, Depakote, Baclofen, Lasix, Actos, Pravachol,
Januvia, Toprol-XL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal 10 Hz polymorphic alpha activity is noted posteriorly.  The AP gradient is
weak.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  During
drowsiness, the degree of theta activity increases.
Subtle polymorphic delta activity is noted over the right anterior temporal region.  No clear
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, moderate, right temporal, anterior, subtle slowing
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG because of mild diffuse slowing and
subtle focal moderate right anterior temporal slowing.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is suggestive of
focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.
