CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed gentleman with left occipital infarct,
right homonymous hemianopsia, and right-sided tingling.
MEDICATIONS: Lantus, ASA. Protonix. Metoprolol, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a 12-Hz alpha
rhythm. This alpha rhythm is approximately 55 microvolts on the right, 30 on the left
The patient drifts into stage 2 sleep with spindles which are slightly asymmetric, slightly
disrupted on the left relative to the right. POSTS are represented bilaterally. Abundant
stage 2 sleep is recorded which is relatively symmetric. Photic stimulation is performed
while the patient is in stage 2 sleep and does not activate the record.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. An asymmetry in spindle activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the significant PCA infarct, this is a relatively
normal EEG. The failure to identify focal features may represent volume conduction in
the occipital region, but in any case, no epileptiform features were noted.
