REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, dementia and GERD with 3 days of right upper extremity shaking.
Technical difficulties:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan 12 mg, fentanyl 50 mg.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall the record reveals a very suppressed EEG with some intermittent low amplitude spindles and spindle frequency discharges seen throughout.  During the recording the technician applied a sternal rub and there was increase or viability to the EEG.
Seizures:  None.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and a very low amplitude of less than 10 microvolts with intermittent bursts of spindle activity.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, however, the intermittent spindles suggest that it may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
