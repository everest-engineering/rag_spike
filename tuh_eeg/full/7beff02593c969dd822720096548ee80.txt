REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old woman with history of seizures for 27 years, here for follow up EEG.  The patient had a seizure 6 months ago with loss of consciousness, bladder incontinence and postictal back to baseline in half an hour.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 system with one anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I, stage II sleep.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None, however there are 2 left temporal sharp transients that are suspicious but not clearly epileptiform.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG with no seizures or epileptiform discharges that were clearly seen.  However, there are 2 left sharp transients that are suspicious for epileptiform activity.  Please note that this has been seen in the previous EEGs.
