History:	58 YR MALE S/P GAMMA KNIFE FOR CEREBRAL METS.  PT HAD SZ WHEN
THEY FOUND METS BRAIN.  NOW WITH ANOTHER SZ 3 WKS AGO.  PMHX:
MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF COLON, LUNG CA SURGERY, LIVER SURGERY.  PT
GETS CHEMO.  JUST HAD CHEMO TODAY
Medications:	KEPPRA,  MORPHINE, METHADONE, DILAUDID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral temporal region (right more than
left) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 132 irregular and with PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
frontotemporal region (right more than left) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.
These findings are indicative of mild  diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
