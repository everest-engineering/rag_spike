HISTORY: A 57-year-old woman who experienced seizure February 2013 while watching TV.

Trembling With loss of consciousness. Previously admitted to the hospital March 26th for a syncopal

spell.

Tramadol, baclofen, Klonopin, others.

Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode

Placement with one channel EKG. This Is a technically satisfactory routine EEG aside from poor

electrode impedance.

OF

THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there Is 8 high amplitude, 10Hz, 70 microvolt

posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness Is

characterized by slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm and a small increase In

beta.

Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicited

bilateral driving. Rare PVCs were noted.

Heart rate 60 BPM.

Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.

CORRELATION: This is the 2nd normal EEG for this patient If epilepsy is an important

8 repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep or using additional techniques may be of

value.
