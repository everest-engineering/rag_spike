STUDY DATE:  08/28/2013 to 08/29/2013

REASON FOR STUDY:  Hypothermia.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old man status post PEA code on the 26th of August 2013, down for 30 minutes.  Has a past medical history of hypertension, CHF, obstructive sleep apnea, and now here for hypothermia protocol.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Dilantin, Versed.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed from 08/28/2013 to 08/29/2013 for a total of 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background which has an absent posterior dominant rhythm or normal organization.  Overall, there are periodic generalized epileptiform discharges that occur at 1-2 Hz continuously throughout the recording.  These generalized epileptiform periodic discharges have a polyspike morphology and appear to be maximal in the central and frontal regions.  At times they appear to be larger in amplitude and have consistent muscle artifact with them.  At times there is a blinking artifact that goes along with them.  In the video you could see that there are facial movements that coincide with these discharges.  In between the discharges there is complete suppression of all activity.  This pattern is seen continuously throughout the recording.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) seen continuously as described above.
2. Severe attenuation of the background.

HEART RATE:  66, appears to be irregular.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to severe diffuse slowing and generalized periodic epileptiform discharges.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction in addition to evidence of diffuse brain irritability, which is consistent with a known history of hypoxic injury.  No seizures are clearly seen.
