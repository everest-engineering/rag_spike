History:	29 year old man with a history of TBI and seizures. He denies recent seizures. Medications:	Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
None
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes , awake, drowsy , photic
Description:
There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms over the left hemisphere. The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that is less formed and polymorphic over the right.  Clear AP gradient is present over the left. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic semirhythmic delta activity is present over the right. Excess fast activity is present over the left central region. Excess polymorphic theta activity is noted over the right. Occasional right central sharp waves are noted. Maximal scalp negativity occurs over the C4 electrode.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities .
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, mild-to-moderate Sharp transients, occasional, right central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG does to mild-to-moderate right hemispheric slowing and occasional right central epileptiform discharges. Continuous focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology. Occasional right central epileptiform discharges indicate a potentially epileptogenic focal structural abnormality over the right central region. Of note, previous EEG from 3/2014 should intermittent right anterior temporal epileptiform discharges that are not seen on this
recording.
