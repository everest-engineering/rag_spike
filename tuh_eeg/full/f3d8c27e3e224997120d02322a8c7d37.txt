History:	43 YR FEMALE WITH EPISODE OF LEFT SIDE NUMBNESS, CONFUSION, APHASIC 9/11/14. WORKUP  NEG FOR CVA, PT STATES HAS BEEN HAVING EPISODES OF SHAKING DURING PM, URINATING ON SELF AND SORE MOUTH.  PMHX: PSYCH, ASTHMA
Medications:	ZOLOFT, ASA, TRAMADOL, NEURONTIN. FIORICET
Sedation:


EEG Type:
· Technique:


Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates from 7 to 21 fps.  HR 84

Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous, moderate diffuse

Interpretation:
·This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
