CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year old right woman with a stroke 20 years ago and dysarthria, 5 mm aneurysm.

MEDICATIONS: Klonopin, Sertraline, Verapamil, Lisinopril, Lipitor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG demonstrates a 9 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is a small amount of frontocentral theta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing sleep may be considered. Given the magnitude of chronic ischemic changes the EEG finding are quite modest.
