DILANTIN


Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, drowsy, lethargic, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm can be seen intermittently and at best it reaches 8Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.   Diffuse, posteriorly maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Some state changes could be appreciated.

No focal slowing is present. There is some intermittently sharply contoured discharges in the bilateral posterior quadrants. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.   Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second {fps) does not produce any effect.   HR 84

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse Disorganization, continuous diffuse
Triphasic waves, abundant, bilateral posterior

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL  EEG because of  severely disorganized background with diffuse slowing and a slow alpha rhythm that at best reaches 8Hz.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. There are also  frequent posteriorly-maximal triphasic waves.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.)
