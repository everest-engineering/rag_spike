History:	56 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O AUTO VS PEDESTRIAN MVA
Medications:	Vasopressin, Norepinephrine, Cefazolin, Metronidazole
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is marked suppression of the background activity on the right.  There is an obvious
hemispheric asymmetry with increased amplitudes over the left hemisphere (the patient has a
known prior surgical skull defect).  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  There are intermittent sharp waves noted over the left hemisphere,
maximal over the left temporal regions (there is a broad firta that at times includes the left frontal
region).  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was minimal reactivity to
auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Sharp waves, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Sharp waves have epileptiform potential. The hemispheric asymmetry may reflect a prior known
surgical skull defect in this patient.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
