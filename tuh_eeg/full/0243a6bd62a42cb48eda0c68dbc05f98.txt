INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In relaxed wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. In relaxed wakefulness and In hyperventilation, there are occasional bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic theta. Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and some frontal delta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.

HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are nonspecific. They can be due to a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as this patients medications. No epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional EEG recording may be appropriate.
