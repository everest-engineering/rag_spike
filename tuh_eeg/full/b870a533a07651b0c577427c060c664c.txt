CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old male with acute renal failure and change of mental status:
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is asymmetric frontocentral beta seen with less frequency on the left hemisphere.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of structural focal dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region which is consistent with the known previous injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
