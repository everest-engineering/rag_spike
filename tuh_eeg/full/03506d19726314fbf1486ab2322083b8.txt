History:	62 year old woman who presents with confusion, generalized weakness, slurred
Medications:	no AEDs, solumedrol, aspirin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 7-8 Hz.  AP gradient is weak.  The background consists
primarily of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta activity.  Patient is awake throughout the
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Frequent slow eye flutter artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, eye movement, frequent, eye flutter
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 24-minute EEG because of mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing
and disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild -to-
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Since there is frequent eye flutter artifact, subtle anterior
focal slowing could have been missed.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
