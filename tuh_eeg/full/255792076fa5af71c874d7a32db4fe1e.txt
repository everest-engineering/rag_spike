CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old male with HIV and 6 months of vertigo.  Vertigo occurs without head movement.
MEDICATIONS:  Risperdal and Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.
Hyperventilation produces slowing of the background.
There are sections of the record when the patient is maximally awake, such as during photic stimulation where the alpha rhythm is somewhat slow, 7.8 to 8.3 Hz.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:  Intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The mild background slowing is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction due to many different causes.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
