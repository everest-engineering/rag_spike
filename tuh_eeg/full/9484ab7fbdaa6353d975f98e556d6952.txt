History:	37 YEAR OLD WITH MIGRAINES, IS VERY LIGHT SENSITIVE. PMHX- 3/ 25 LOC
Medications:	None.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 66
F4 electrode continuous artifact was noted and could not be fixed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1hr EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. No clinical or electrographic seizures are
present.
