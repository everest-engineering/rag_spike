CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old woman with epilepsy, seizures, hypertension, weakness, and nausea. PRES in 2010.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.7 Hz, a small amount of excess theta, a scant amount of disorganization, and generous beta.  Sleep is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing with well organized vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep and did not activate the record.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing and disorganization.
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This is the 3rd EEG for this individual.  None have identified epileptiform activity, but the 2010 EEG, at that time of PRES also showed some degree of disorganization.  The findings today may represent a postictal pattern, or a manifestation of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
