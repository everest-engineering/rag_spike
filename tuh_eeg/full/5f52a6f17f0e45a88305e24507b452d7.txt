CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old woman who had as many as 15 seizures with tonic clonic activity.  Seizures were brief.  No loss of consciousness.  Past history of head trauma in 2000.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG monitoring.  The patient is somewhat drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of theta.  Features of drowsiness include prominent spread of 11 Hz alpha rhythm frontally and then prominent beta.
HR:    60-90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Although this was a technically challenging EEG due to the patient's hair weave, there were no epileptiform features noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta and small amount of theta may be due to this patient's medications.
