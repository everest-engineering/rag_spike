REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 20-year-old man with a history of motor vehicle accident in 2010 and seizures, most recently 1 month ago when he ran out of medications.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
HEART RATE:  54 which at times appears to be changing in frequencies with respirations.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed in using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8-9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
Please note the asymmetric interval in the EKG, which may be due to respiratory related changes.
