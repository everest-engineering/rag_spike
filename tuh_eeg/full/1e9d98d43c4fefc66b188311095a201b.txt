AGE : 20 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient 777a
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep bedside portable EEG #: 15-1758
HISTORY:
20 y.o. male with a history of recurrent seizures, recent onset with a total of 7 seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation of Todd's paralysis versus stroke.	CT scan and CT perfusion normal.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
·A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was ·recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG but no HV and no photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE :
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
