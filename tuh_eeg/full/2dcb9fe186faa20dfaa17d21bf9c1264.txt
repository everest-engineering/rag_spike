CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 47-year-old male with childhood epilepsy, seizures recurred in 2011 associated with anxiety and depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Temazepam, Celexa, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a routine 20 minute EEG with acceptable impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is somewhat drowsy.  The patient transitions in and out of an awake state with a well-defined, 9.2 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and serve to keep the patient awake as well as increasing the amplitude of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving response.
Brief, stage 2 sleep included some electrode artifacts, but spindles were identified.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This is in contrast to a previous EEG, October 27, 2011, which identified 2 left frontal sharp waves/spikes.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged sleep study may be of use.
