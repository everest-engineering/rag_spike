MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, Norvasc, and nifedipine.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 82-year-old woman with acute stroke on 05/23/2015, evaluate for seizures/ obtundation
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically challenging record with a great deal of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  Much of the EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with a lower voltage and more featureless delta noted on the right and 4-6 hertz theta activity on the left.  Towards the end of the record with stimulation, there is an increase in faster frequency activity on the left.  The patient remains relatively somnolent.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing with marked attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right.
Significant slowing on the left with some variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The features described above may be part of both a toxic or metabolic phenomenon or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, superimposed on a structural process involving gray and white matter on the right.  No epileptiform features were noted.
