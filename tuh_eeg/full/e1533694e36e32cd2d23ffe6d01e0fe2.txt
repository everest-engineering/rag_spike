History:	81 YR OLD MALE AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE WHEN HE CODED AND BECAME
UNRESPONSIVE TAKE TO CHESTNUT HILL . TAKEN HERE LAST NIGHT TO
TEMPLE.
Medications:	FENTANYL,NOREPI,HEPARIN,MIDAZOLAM,AMIODARONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by intermittent
low voltage delta with frequent diffuse attenuation and absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  There are some right occipital sharp waves seen.  On video the
patient has frequent facial jerks. On the EEG reveals a muscle artifact. However there appears to be
an underlying generalized polyspike correlate to the jerk. .  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 43
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, right occipital
Polyspikes, intermittent, bilateral generalized, with associated myoclonus
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Attenuation, frequent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the occipital region.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition there
are  frequent generalized epileptiform discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic and also
with the facial jerk are consistent with cortical myoclonus. Lastly there is severe  diffuse background
slowing, attenuation and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The combination of this findings are supportive of
a diffuse cortical injury, consistent with the history of anoxia.
