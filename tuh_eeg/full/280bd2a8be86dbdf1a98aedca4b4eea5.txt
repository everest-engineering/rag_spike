CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old woman with refractory tonic clonic seizures, seizure free since December.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.
Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
