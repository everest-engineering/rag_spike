INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed utilizing the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation and photic stimulation EKG and EOG monitoring.  The patient is a 25-year-old man with brain injury in a motor vehicle accident and 4 seizures over the past 5 years, which are generalized with loss of consciousness, the most recent one occurring one month ago.  He was awake during the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake resting background reveals a moderate amount of 20-40 microvolt amplitude, mildly disorganized 9-11 Hz activity posteriorly and a large amount of low voltage 20-30 Hz activity maximum anteriorly.  Moderate amounts of frontal eye blink and frontotemporal muscle artifact were seen.  Alpha rhythm was somewhat reactive to eye opening and closing and appeared better developed over the left hemisphere.  In addition, there was occasional superimposed low to medium voltage 4-6 Hz activity over temporal and parieto-occipital regions, more prominent on the right.  Hyperventilation for 3 minutes produced no significant activation of record.  Photic stimulation was accompanied by symmetric occipital driving.  EKG monitor showed sinus bradycardia at 52 per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to mild background disorganization and hemispheric asymmetry with alpha rhythm better developed on the left and mild increased on right.  Posterior hemispheric slowing during wakefulness.  These are nonspecific abnormalities indicative of a mild functional disturbance predominantly over the right hemisphere without any clinical or electrographic seizures and with no definite pathological paroxysmal epileptiform activity recorded.
