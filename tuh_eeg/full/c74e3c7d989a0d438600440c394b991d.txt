CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since childhood,
complicated by depression, 1 to 2 seizures per month. History of left temporal and left
occipital epileptiform activity.

MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra, Zonisamide, Lovastatin, Levetiracetam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hype/Ventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Hype/Ventilation and drowsiness are characterized by slow, rhythmic, theta in the left
anterior temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR: 78bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform findings were not identified today, although
previous EEGs have identified left temporal and occipital sharp waves. The rhythmic
slowing is similar to previous studies and is typical of temporal lobe epilepsy.
