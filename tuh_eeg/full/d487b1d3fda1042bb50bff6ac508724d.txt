CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old right-handed gentleman with recent nocturnal tonic-clonic seizure characterized by shaking without tongue biting or incontinence or eyes rolling up in the head.  Family history of epilepsy, diabetes, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening with a small amount of low voltage, frontal, central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and a small amount of background slowing.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and produces some 12 hertz rhythmic activity in addition to the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat, more prolonged tracing may be of value.
