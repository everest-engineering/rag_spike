CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with left posterior temporal parietal teratoma is status post recent craniectomy and with a single seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Oxcarbazepine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulations are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrated a well organized pattern of an adult of this age with a 10.5 Hertz alpha reading reaching 50-60 microvolts. In addition, during periods of hyperventilation, there is some bilateral frontal delta in addition to some C3 sharp waves. A breech rhythm is identified in the left temporal region concordant with the above mentioned and subtle focal slowing. Features of drowsiness includes generalized background slowing with some vertex wave and K-complex. The patient transitioned in and out of sleep. Hyperventilation elicits a background slowing.
HR: 65 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG.
1. C3 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is improved from prior. The breech rhythm is anticipated following craniotomy. The sharp waves support a focal mechanism for seizures.
