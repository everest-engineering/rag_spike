AGE : 87 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 10/12/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake only EEG #: 15-1501
HISTORY :
87 y.o. Female with a history of Parkinson's disease and COPD referred for routine EEG after 3 episodes of loss of consciousness with right facial drooping, and eye closure (there is no accompanying incontinence or tongue biting).
MEDICATIONS : carbidopa SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies with occasional admixed delta, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.
There is mild generalized slowing.
There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing, and occasional both synchronous and independent right temporal polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake only routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing
Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing
Occasional right temporal polymorphic slowing, which is at times synchronous with and other times independent of the left temporal slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of bitemporal (left > right) cerebral dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.	If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
