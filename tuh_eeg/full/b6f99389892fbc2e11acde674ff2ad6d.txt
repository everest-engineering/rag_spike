CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old male status post a long hospital course with enterococcus and strongyloides, immunocompromised persistently sedated.

MEDICATIONS:  Cyclosporine, CellCept, insulin, __________, albendazole, ivermectin, many other.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, comatose and hypothermic.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG has low voltage, markedly slow with a mixture slow delta and scant amounts of beta and theta.  Rare FIRDA was noted.

Stimulation of the patient did not significantly activate the record.

Heart rate 132 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage, slow pattern.
2. Absence of reactivity or variability.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports severe underlying encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were seen.  There were no specific hallmarks of specific type of encephalopathy.  These findings may be correlated with imaging and other neurodiagnostic tests.
