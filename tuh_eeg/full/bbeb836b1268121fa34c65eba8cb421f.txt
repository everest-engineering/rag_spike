CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman was adult onset epilepsy for 17 years, infrequent tonic-clonic seizures, but usually elicited by stress.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was  performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No seizures were noted by the patient or clinical team.
TECHNICAL ISSUES:  Electrode challenges and significant muscle and movement artifacts when the patient was awake were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG remains a bit slow and a bit disorganized with an alpha rhythm of approximately 8.5 Hz, but some slower theta frequency activity.  Intermittent, relatively arrhythmic paroxysmal slowing was noted and this could be seen in wakefulness or the transition to drowsiness.  There was also some shifting slowing observed.  As the recording on the 25th continued, there were prolonged sections in wakefulness which lack the background slowing noted initially.
Despite electrode issues, the overnight sleep recording included slow wave sleep.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Long-term monitoring for this patient was remarkable for:
A slow and disorganized background.
Bursts of paroxysmal slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing.
An episode of incontinence without EEG change.
Sharply contoured slowing, but without definitive spikes or spike and wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This abnormal EEG demonstrated improvement over time.  Although there was paroxysmal slowing and even some focality noted in the early sections of the record, there was no distinct epileptiform focus.  The improvement over time may be due to the medication reduction during the long-term monitoring.
