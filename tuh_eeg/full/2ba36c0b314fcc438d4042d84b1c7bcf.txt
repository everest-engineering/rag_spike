CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman with multiple cardiac pathologies, seizure 2 weeks ago characterized by a feeling of fatigue, thirst then stiffness with inability to respond. This was followed by a tonic-clonic seizure. Past history of staring spells.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol, Levothyroxine, Digoxin, Lasix, Carbatrol, Amiodarone, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is scant excess beta and excess theta observed in the background. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits  a driving response.
HR: 68 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no focal nor epileptiform features observed; however, epilepsy is an important consideration and repeat tracing capturing more extensive sleep is suggested.
