History:	44YR WOMAN ADMITTED FOR ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, RIGHT FACIAL
DROOP, SLURRED SPEECH. HX SUBDURAL HEMATOMA, LEFT OCCIPITAL
CRANIOTOMY IN 2013. HEART FAILURE, LVAD. NORMAL HEAD CT.
Medications:	ASA, WARFARIN, GABAPENTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Technical difficulties: There is a
continuous artifact at about 1Hz throughout the recording, which limits detection of focal slowing in
this EEG. This artifact seems to follow the EKG rhythm, and therefore is most likely a result of the
patient's LVAD.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, other, continuous diffuse, centrally predominant
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Interpretation is limited by continuous artifact. No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
