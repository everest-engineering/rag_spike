CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed female with a history of seizure disorder
since age 17. The last seizure was one week ago, a tonoclonic seizure with postictal
confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab with standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation is performed. This was
an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm.Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta with some central theta.
Photic stimulation elicits supraharmonic driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. In this individual with what sounds like a
generalized epilepsy, hyperventilation was not performed. Please return the patient to
the lab for a more prolonged study, capturing deeper stages of sleep and including
hyperventilation.
