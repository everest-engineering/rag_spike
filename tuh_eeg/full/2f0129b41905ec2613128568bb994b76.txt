History:	52 YR OLFD FEMALE PRESENTS ON 2/9/14 WITH H/O CHANGE IN STATUS 2
NDTO SZ VS INTOXICATION VS METABOLIC
Medications:	HEPARIN, FAMOTIDINE, LABETALOL, POTASSIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a poorly-formed 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz beta activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 6-7 Hz theta activity during
wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 95 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
