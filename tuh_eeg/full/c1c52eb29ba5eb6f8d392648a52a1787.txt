HISTORY: A 69-year-old woman presented with acute unresponsiveness bilateral lower extreme weakness, psoriasis and atrial defibrillation
MEDICINES: Digoxin, metformin, simvastatin and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the two hemispheres. During much of the record, the right hemisphere is low voltage with an alpha rhythm reaching 8.5 Hz. The left hemisphere is remarkable for marked disruption of faster frequency activity, arrhythmic delta activity and some sharply contoured slowing with a generous field of spread 1n the right central temporal region. The right frontal central regions also demonstrate dramatic reduction of faster frequency. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
Heart rate Markedly irregular 100
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to
1 Marked slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Sharply contoured slowing from the left maximum at T3.
3. Mild background slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were identified This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter.
