CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old male with cerebral palsy, past history of epilepsy, currently with panic attacks, anxiety, and intermittent space out spells.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Tegretol, Others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG monitoring.  This EEG captured wakefulness and sleep.  Sleep was at times somewhat disrupted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Intermittently in wakefulness, there is a small degree of theta noted.  Where, shifting asymmetries were noted in the transition in and out of sleep.  Lambda waves were noted in wakefulness.  In stage 2 sleep, bradycardia was noted with a heart rate nadir of 30.  The stage 2 sleep was somewhat disrupted.
The patient reported 30 events during the EEG with panic, loss of train of thought or anxiety.  Unfortunately, the monitoring system failed to capture the patient's push buttons, although the seizure and spike detector identified abundant normal variants.  No epileptiform seizures were noted during this first 24 hours.
Heart rate 30-70 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this first 24 hours of recording was remarkable for:
Sinus bradycardia.
Occasional background theta.
