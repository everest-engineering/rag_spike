CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 12, nocturnal tonic-clonic and daytime absence seizures, vagal nerve stimulator implanted.  The patient reported an increase in tonic-clonic seizures around the time of her period associated with stress and then an increase in staring spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was extremely drowsy throughout the EEG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta.  There are rare, left anterior temporal sharp waves noted, and a small amount of left anterior temporal slowing.
Photic stimulation was technically somewhat complicated by muscle artifact, but a driving response was elicited.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically somewhat challenging but abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing in apparent wakefulness.
Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG differs from previous studies in that there is a bit more background slowing and that there are focal rather than generalized epileptiform features.  These findings may be correlated with this patient's clinical picture.
