CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 16-year-old right-handed female, in the 1st trimester of pregnancy with blackout spells which come on when she is stressed.  Newly pregnant with 2 previous miscarriages, currently residing in foster care.  Psychiatric illness not otherwise disclosed.  Most recent blackout spell 1-2 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Abilify.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes of 16 microvolts.  Posterior slow waves of youth were identified as was mu rhythm.  Wicket was noted as the patient became drowsy.  Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited driving at intermediate flash frequencies.  Heart rate 90 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.
