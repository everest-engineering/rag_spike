History:	31 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENT WITH H/O UNCONTROLLED SZ
Medications:	Keppra and Dilantin. Also received ativan on 09/28/2014 in AM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at P3 and large central field. At times they appear rhythmically in runs for up
to 15 seconds.  There were 3 seizures during this record, lasting 10 to 15 seconds. They start with
rhythmic left parietal (P3) sharp waves that increase in frequency and amplitude.The field spreads
centrally but remain mainly in the central and parietal region.  She may lift her right arm and reach
out for an object, then hold or fumble with it. She continues this behavior for a few seconds until
she suddenly stops.  She does not follow commands during the event. She is post ictally confused
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 90.
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, few, clinical and electrographic, left parietal
Sharp waves, frequent, abnormal, left parietal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of three electrographic seizures
arising from the left parietal region.  These findings are indicative of an epileptogenic focus in this
