REASON FOR EEG:  Mysterious seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old man with history of seizures and a strange spell a week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T3 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
