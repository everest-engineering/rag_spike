CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old right-handed woman with 3 events in December 2014, where she had an aura of a taste in her mouth, and loss of consciousness followed by confusion.  Migraine.  Family history unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilohms.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous, eye blink artifact.  In the transition to sleep, there is 14-6 variant noted in the anterior regions, left or right.  Features of sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  The patient is noted to snore and is falling asleep during photic stimulation and then awakens by her own snoring.  A minimal driving response was identified.
Hyperventilation produces no significant driving and the patient drifted off to stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient appears to have uncommon normal variant, 14 and 6 activity, which was seen in less than 2.5% of the population.  This patient also appears to be hypersomnolent, falling asleep during photic stimulation, and arousing with snoring.  Given the clinical question outlined above, alternative EEG recording strategies may be considered.
