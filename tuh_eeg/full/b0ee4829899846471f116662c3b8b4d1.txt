CLINICAL HISTORY:  Evaluate for xanax withdrawal seizures and pregnancy.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Vistaril, Xanax, and prenatal vitamins.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was a technically acceptable awake and asleep EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly transitioned in and out of sleep, reaching stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.  Sleep is somewhat disrupted.

Photic stimulation elicited supraharmonic driving.

Heart rate 84 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
