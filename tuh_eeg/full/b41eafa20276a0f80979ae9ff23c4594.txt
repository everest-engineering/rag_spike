CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old male with likely gliomatosis cerebri, mental retardation and epilepsy, status post biopsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow, medium amplitude pattern.  There is abundant theta noted in the background and the overall background is 40-60 even 70 microvolts in amplitude.  The patient is clearly awake during sections of the record, which are rich in theta, but are irregular with irregular underlying delta.  There is a suggestion of breach rhythm, as well as some attenuation of activity in the left anterior temporal region, but this is seen intermittently.  There are occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.
A single high amplitude, right mid to posterior temporal spike and slow wave complex was noted as the patient was drifting off into drowsiness.
Heart rate 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
A single right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous study, this is a higher amplitude, somewhat richer EEG.  Less epileptiform activity was noted today.
This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No seizures were recorded.
