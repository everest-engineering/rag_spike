CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old woman with a TIA 3 months ago characterized by left-sided numbness and weakness.  The patient now experiences intermittent tingling in her fingers.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a background with generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in background theta with an increase in generous beta followed by vertex waves, spindles and K complexes.  Occasional arousals from sleep were noted.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep, but did elicit a driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed with poor effort.  No significant driving was noted.
Heart rate 50 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The bradycardia may be evaluated clinically.
