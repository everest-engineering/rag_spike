LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  1 hour and 2 minutes
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 25-year-old man with past medical history of drug abuse, now found down by wife with needle in the arm in the bathroom after being alone for about 2 minutes.  Pulseless electrical activity was documented in the field.  The patient was later revived.  Now the patient is with generalized myoclonic jerks concerning for status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and vecuronium is given later during the exam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  From the beginning of the recording until approximately 02:46:30 p.m. EEG consists of diffuse multiple artifact. This makes evaluation of the underlying EEG activity unreliable.
At approximately 02:46:20 p.m., 10 mg of vecuronium is administered.  EEG artifact subsequently disappears within about 10-20 seconds.  Subsequent record demonstrates low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with posterior under-riding frequencies, without posterior dominant rhythm or anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  No abnormal sleep architecture is present.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was not performed.  Sinus tachycardia is captured on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Disorganization.
Symmetry.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal greater than 1-hour EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and thus disorganization.  These findings indicate nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that in this patient could partially be related to the medication effect.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team and to the neurology consult team at the time of the recording.
