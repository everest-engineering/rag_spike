History:	29YO MALE WITH SZ HISTORY WAS BROUGHT INTO ED AFTER WITNESSED
SZ AT WORK EPISODE OF GENERALIZED SHAKING, TONGUE BITING,
INCONTINENCE OF UNKNOWN DURATION.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent brief bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal 2-3 Hz, 50-60 uV slow waves are observed
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 75-80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Excess theta during wakefulness.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing during wakefulness and
intermittent brief bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal delta activity during drowsiness.  These
findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. This
pattern could also be seen in post-ictal state.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
