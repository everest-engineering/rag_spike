History:	74 YR FEMALE S/P AORTIC DISSECTION SURGERY WITH CIRC ARREST /
COOLING.  POST OP SEIZURE.  PT WITH  RIGHT AND SHAKING AND BODY
POSTURING.
PMHX: PACEMAKER FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	KEPPRA,  DILANTIN,  PER NURSE OFF SEDATION X 5 DYS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  nearly continuous focal slowing in the right frontotemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
