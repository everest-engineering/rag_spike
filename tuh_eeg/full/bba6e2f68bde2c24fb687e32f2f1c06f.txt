History:	86 YO M WITH HX. SEIZURES. LAST SZ 9 MONTHS AGO W/SHAKING,TONGUE
BITE, AND FOAMING @ MOUTH. NOW COMPLAINING OF HEADACHES FOR THE
PAST 3-4 MONTHS
Medications:	Unknown
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  There are recurrent brief runs of 6-7 Hz sharply contoured
activity in the midline consistent with either a psychomotor variant or midline theta variant pattern.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a modest symmetric photic
driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Psychomotor variant and midline theta are
considered normal EEG variants.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
