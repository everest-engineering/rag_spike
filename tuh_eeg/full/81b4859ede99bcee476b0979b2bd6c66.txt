CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old with 2-year history of epilepsy.  History of convulsions.  Last seizure was 2 weeks ago when he had an aura of a funny smell while riding his bike that was followed by 30 minutes of confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage.  There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm present bilaterally, a bit more apparent on the right compared to the left in this low voltage record.  Features of drowsiness include generous beta followed by rhythmic theta.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and did not significantly activate the record.  Characteristic features of sleep include POSTS and an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep.  Features of stage 2 sleep were noted in photic stimulation with spindles, POSTS, and vertex waves.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging EEG and is a low voltage EEG but is without epileptiform pathology.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive focal features were noted.  No sharp waves were seen.  In this low voltage EEG, consideration for a follow up study is appropriate.  POSTS are a bit more prominent on the right than the left, but this is not a pathological finding.
