CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41 -year-old male with seizures, most recent seizure 3 days ago; the patient fell, hit his head and had lacerations in the left frontal region.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital and phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Generous background beta was noted.  In addition, there is rhythmic beta noted in the frontal regions with some shifting asymmetries.
Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate the shifting asymmetries with perhaps a bit more right midtemporal and frontocentral focal slowing noted in hyperventilation.  Head rocking artifact was noted.  Following hyperventilation, the patient drifts into stage 1 sleep with vertex waves.  As the patient drifts into sleep, there is some artifact but again there is just a bit more focal slowing on the right compared to the left.  There is also beta asymmetry noted at times with a bit more beta on the right compared to the left.
Photic stimulation elicited a scant, bilateral driving response.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Excess beta.
Shifting temporal slowing, right more so than the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The shifting slowing, right greater than left may be correlated with imaging.  There was a beta asymmetry but no mention of a cranial defect.  Correlation with scalp and imaging may be helpful in this individual with a history of head trauma.
