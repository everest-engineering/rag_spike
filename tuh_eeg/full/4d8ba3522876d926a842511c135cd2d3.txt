History:	62 year old with seizures.
Medications:	NEURONTIN, norvasc, methadone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz theta activity with weak
AP gradient.  Overall, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate amplitude
theta and delta activity without clear focal slowing.  There is subtle but nearly continuous
movement artifact.  No normal sleep architecture is present despite episodes of drowsiness noted by
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 23-minute portable EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  When compared to prior recent EEGs, epileptiform discharges are no longer present.
Additionally, focal slowing observed on recent EEG also does not appear on this record.  The latter
could be related to continuous movement - artifact could obscure subtle changes.
