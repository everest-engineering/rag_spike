CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman, 4 years status post right temporal lobectomy.  Patient had a seizure with severe emotional distress and now sometimes feels as if there is something not quite right.  No seizures for the past month.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, metoprolol, Restoril, and Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG for a patient with previous right temporal craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates mild, generalized background slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm of 8-9 hertz and excess theta.  Breach rhythm is identified from the right temporal region with intermittent focal slowing, and accentuation of theta activity in that region.
Heart rate: 60 bpm, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right temporal focal slowing.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  The excess background theta may be evaluated by other clinical means.  Comparison with previous EEGs was not possible at this time.
