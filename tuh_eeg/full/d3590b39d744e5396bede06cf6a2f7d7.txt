CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old right handed woman with a history of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, on hemodialysis.  The patient is currently admitted with altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Midodrine, Renagel, Medroxyprogesterone, Zosyn, dexamethasone, Chlorhexidine, Linezolid, Protonix, ciprofloxacin, Cosyntropin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of low-to-moderate amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Occasional diffuse frontally predominant triphasic waveforms with anterior-to-posterior lag are present.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  No clear electrographic seizures observed.  There is frequent movement artifact throughout the recording that is not associated with ictal activity.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate up to 128 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
No electrographic seizures.
Occasional triphasic waveforms.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal 22-minute awake only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowly and occasional triphasic waveforms.  These findings indicate moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific etiology but could be toxic metabolic in etiology.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consulting team.
