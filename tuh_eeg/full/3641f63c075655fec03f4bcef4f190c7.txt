HISTORY: 74 year old woman with Alzheimer's disease, hypertension and delirium.
Evaluate for Stiff man Syndrome.
MEDICATIONS: Aricept, Lisinopril, Metformin, Glipizide, ASA, Atenolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was somnolent. Photic stimulation is performed. The patient is examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern. There is primarily a theta frequency record with delta. In addition to eye movement artifacts, there are some triphasic waves. There are also some triangular shaped posteriorly predominant periodic complexes, in posterior location very triphasic-like wave. Intermittent attenuation of the record is noted. There are some electrode problems at T3. There are a handful of sharp waves noted at C4 and T4. Stimulation of the patient produces some artifacts, but does not really change the overall background. There are some very subtle T2 sharp waves noted in the background. Photic stimulation produces primarily artifact.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Triphasic waves, posteriorly predominant
3. Some periodic activity in the occipital regions.
4. Rare sharp waves from the right temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings should be correlated clinically. There are no seizures recorded, but there are hallmarks of metabolic encephalopathy. In this clinical context, sharp waves may support an underlying diagnosis of seizures, but given the posterior, periodic nature, careful evaluation as to the cause, type and duration of the dementia is suggested.
