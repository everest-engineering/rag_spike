Medications:	Dilantin, Trazodone, Fioricet, Albuterol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by not clearly well-defined 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm
superimposed by diffuse 5-10uV, 18-25Hz beta activity.  Continuous high voltage 18-25 Hz beta
activity is present, maximal frontally.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent delta activity is present in the left anterior and mid temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, left temporal
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect. This is an abnormal EEG due to  intermittent
focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  EEG is limited because of diffuse beta activity.  If clinically
indicated, suggest repeat EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
