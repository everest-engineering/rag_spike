current facility-administered medications :ATORVASTATIN, FAMOTIDINE
SEDATION: none TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. There is excess diffuse theta	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. There is generous beta.
Sleep: no stage II sleep.
Generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: n/a EVENTS
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal routine EEG. 1.Excess theta
2. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected .
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
Supportive of a mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which can include medications, toxic or metabolic process or even post ictal state.	No epileptiform features.
This	EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
