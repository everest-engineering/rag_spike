History:	27 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS  WITH  HX OF SZ S/P MVA IN 2008. PT IS ON
METHADONE FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE.
Medications:	Lamictal, Clonidine, Depakote, Neurontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 82.5 hours from 06/04/2015 to 06/08/2015.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was seen to at best reach 9Hz  Background activity was characterized
by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  mild diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
