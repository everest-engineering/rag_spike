History:	39 yo right handed female with episodes of rising tingling sensation starting at
feet, followed by LOC. Occurring 1-2x per month.
Medications:	trileptal, valium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess beta activity is seen diffusely.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at various flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Beta diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The excess beta activity captured can be seen secondary to medications,
including benzodiazepines.
