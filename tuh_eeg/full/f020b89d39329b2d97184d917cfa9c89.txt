History:	33 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SZS. LAST SZ 2008/ GTC/TONGUE
BITE/URINARY INCONT.  PMHX: MR (5TH GR), ENCEPHALOCELE VP SHUNT.
Medications:	NEURONTIN, DEPAKOTE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-9Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep 1 hour EEG because of mild diffuse background
slowing.  These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.
