REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  41-year-old man with history of mental retardation, epilepsy, ADHD, aggressive behavior, prolonged seizures in the past.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonazepam, phenobarbital, topiramate, Vimpat, levothyroxine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely disorganized background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall the posterior dominant rhythm appears to reach at best 7 Hz and does not seem to vary much with eye opening and eye closing.  Overall there is diffuse theta, sharply contoured background, with intermittent frontal delta bilaterally, as well as multiple sharply contoured discharges mainly in the central frontal region.  At times there is frank sharp waves in the F3 and F4 region, and as well as FP1.  This pattern  appears to become at times more rhythmic with arousal, but no clear seizures are seen.
Activating procedures included photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen at F3 and F4, as well as C3 and FP1 in wakefulness and sleep.
Generalized theta in wakefulness.
Bifrontal slowing seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Heart rate:  86.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing, as well as bifrontal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures, possibly arising from either the frontal region or prefrontal region bilaterally.  In addition, there is evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
