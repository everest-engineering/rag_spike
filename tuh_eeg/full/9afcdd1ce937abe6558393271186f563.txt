INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE NOTE
A routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 standard electrode placement system with EKG electrode. Sleep including
stage 1 and photic stimulation was recorded. Hyperventilation was not performed.
MEDICATIONS:
Zoloft, Benadryl, Zocor, and aspirin.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None.
HISTORY:
A 46-year-old female presents for follow-up after right occipital stroke and seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The study opens to a well formed posterior abdominal rhythm at 9 to 10Hz with 20 to 70 microvolts amplitude, which is
symmetrically reactive to eye opening. There is a well formed small amount of frontal central beta at 15 to 25Hz and 13 to
60 micro volts amplitude. Short duration sleep is characterized by stage 1. Photic stimulation was normal. Hyperventilation
was not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG, awake and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The EEG was normal. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
