CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed male with seizures poorly described.
History of parietal AVM.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: I n wakefulness, there Is an 11 Hz symmetric
reactive alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing
occasional Isolated bursts of theta in the right temporal region. Drowsiness is
characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation does not significantly
activate the record. This is overall a relatively low voltage record in photic stimulation.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG Is remarkable for:
1. Rare bursts of right temporal slowing in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL These findings are subtle enough and rare enough to be
considered still within normal limits. No epileptiform features were observed.
