REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonus.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old man with a history of cardiac arrest on January 27, 2013, for 15 minutes, now resuscitated and presents with myoclonic jerking, and a past medical history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease, depression and asthma.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, fentanyl, clindamycin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow suppressed background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There was no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
Abnormal discharges:
There is generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPED's) seen with a periodicity of 1-2 Hz and a maximal negativity in the central and occipital regions continuously throughout the recording.  At times they also have a poly spike appearance.  Also, have an accompanied muscle jerk which reveals a focal jaw jerk consistent with myoclonus.
The background appears to be almost completely suppressed with a very amplitude and absent of normal cortical activity.
Heart rate:  94 with a wide complex morphology.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to GPED's and background suppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction in addition to cortical irritability and myoclonus.  This EEG pattern is consistent with a diffuse hypoxic injury and carries a poor prognosis.  No seizures were seen.
