CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 24-year-old female presented on January 19th with possible seizure found by father in bed shaking with myoclonus, no incontinence or tongue biting.  Post event frontal throbbing headache with constant, 1 week headache not alleviated by aspirin.  Asymmetric CT scan with left lateral ventricle larger than the right and sphenoid sinus abnormalities.
MEDICATIONS:  Toradol and Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by rhythmic theta, followed by brief stage 1 sleep with vertex waves.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 20 minute EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be of value.
