CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old male status post transplant with severe sepsis including strongyloides and enterococcus, septic shock, status post gastric bypass, hyperammonemia.  Previous exposure to fentanyl and other sedative hypnotic medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydrocortisone, __________, Zosyn, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside  in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is intubated, comatose.  There is no mention of the use of sedative hypnotic medications during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a mixture of slow delta and scant amounts of theta.  There is little in the way of variability in the record.  Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  Ventilator artifact was observed.  Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow and suppressed background.
A lack of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  There were no focal features.  Of concern, this EEG supports a severe, underlying encephalopathy which may be due to many different causes.  Multisystem failure might contribute to this process, although a possibility of a CNS insult may also be considered.  This EEG was reviewed with the Clinical Team today.
