History:	39 year old woman status post anoxic brain injury, now with stereotyped movements
that occur upon stimulation.
Medications:	no AEDs listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR, AP gradient or reactivity.  The background is attenuated and suppressed, even at
2 microV/mm.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Several episodes of bilateral arm extension and head movements are captured.  They are only
associated to movement artifact.
There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, marked
Event, few, no change in the background
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 hour portable EEG due to complete burst-suppression pattern and lack of
reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked diffuse cerebral
dysfunction and in post-anoxic brain injury indicate poor chance of full neurological recovery.
Several episodes of bilateral arm extension and head movements are not associated with any
change in the EEG background.  This is an isoelectric EEG but is was NOT performed according
the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  These findings were
conveyed to the neurology consult team.
