CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old woman with left cerebellar stroke, respiratory failure, aneurysm, and hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Protonix,  Lipitor. Advair, isosorbide,  Heparin, Spiriva, Diovan
Metoprolol


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient seems to be uncomfortable and somewhat contractured.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG fluctuates from an awake to drowsy pattern. There is generous beta frequency activity noted in the background. Occasional slowing is noted, more so on the right. Bursts of FIRDA are also observed. Comparing the right and left temporal regions the activity on the right appears to be lower voltage and slower. Vertex waves are noted in stage 1 sleep. At the close of the record there is more sustained wakefulness, and in that section of the record there is a
10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm seen intermittently from either hemisphere.


HR:	84 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1.	Slow and disorganized background.
2.	Occasional bursts of slow FIRDA.
Occasional right focal slowing characterized by an increase in delta,  particularly in the temporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are seen. The findings described above may be multifactorial and may represent a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, unlined bihemispheric pathology and/or structural pathology on the right.
