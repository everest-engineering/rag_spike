LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 61-year-old woman with history of balance problems.  She was found subsequently to have a sick sinus syndrome and pacemaker was implanted.  However, the patient has continued to have balance problems despite insertion of the device.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, clonidine, Topamax, lisinopril, Prozac, levothyroxine, Januvia, Prevacid, niacin, Lidoderm patches.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excessive diffuse beta is observed throughout the recording.
During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, bursts of diffuse theta and beta are captured.  Very brief period of stage 2 sleep characterized by symmetrical sleep spindles is observed.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at medium to high flash rates.
Paced heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly asleep 22-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication effects, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
