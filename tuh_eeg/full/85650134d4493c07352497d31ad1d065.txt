History:	45 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES X 30 YRS.  1 A YR.  SUDDEN GEN
SHAKING WITH LOC X FEW MIN. TONGUE BITE/ URINARY INCONTINENCE.
POST ICTAL CONFUSION 1HR. THEN GLOBAL HA.  FATHER/BROTHERS WITH
SZS. PMHX: DEPRESSION/, PANIC ATTACKS.
Medications:	Zoloft, Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
