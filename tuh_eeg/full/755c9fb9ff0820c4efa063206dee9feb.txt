History:	65 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH PRIOR EEG  C/C RT. SIDE RECURRENT
SEVERE HEADACHES. CVA, SZS. PRESENTS NOW FOR 1 HR STUDY WITH NO
NEW EVENTS
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, PHENOBARBITAL, GABAPENTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which is best seen over the
right hemisphere.   5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over the right hemisphere.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Continuous polymorphic delta/theta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal in the anterior temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep 1 hour EEG because of continuous focal slowing
in the  left hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal  region.  This finding is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
