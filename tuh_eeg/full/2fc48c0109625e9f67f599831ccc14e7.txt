CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed man with a past medical history of left temporal hematoma with an intraparenchymal subarachnoid component which was evacuated in October 2011 as well as memory disorder and alcohol abuse who now presents with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at T3.
Focal slow waves seen continuously in the left hemisphere, maximal at F7/T3, at times just at T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts with an associated breach in that region.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left midtemporal sharp waves.
Focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left temporal region,
which is consistent with the known hematoma in that region and surgery.  No seizures were seen.
