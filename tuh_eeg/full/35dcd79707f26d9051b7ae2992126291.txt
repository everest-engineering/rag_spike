CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old woman with adult onset epilepsy, depression, and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Lovastatin, Lamotrigine, Aricept, Furosemide, ASA, Ferrous, Sulfa, Januvia, Singulair,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm at 10Hz, low voltage frontal central beta activity. The patient seems to be quite nervous when awake. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. A fair amount of muscle artifact which might be seen in anxiety.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No left temporal sharp waves or focal slowing were observed today. The beta and the muscle artifact c an be seen in the context of anxiety. The 2 previous EEG identified left temporal abnormalities, left temporal slowing and sharp waves.
