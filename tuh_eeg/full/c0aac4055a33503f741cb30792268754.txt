History:	59 year male with past medical history of seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Dilantin, and others.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left hemisphere consists of well formed and modulated moderate amplitude
10 Hz alpha posteriorly with expected AP gradient.  The background over the right hemisphere
consists of low-to-moderate amplitude 9-9.5 Hz alpha posteriorly, no clear AP gradient,
predominantly low amplitude theta activity with continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity
over the anterior temporal region.  Sleep architecture consisting of vertex waves and sleep spindles
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right temporal, anterior
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to continuous mild right hemispheric
slowing with moderate focal slowing over the right anterior temporal region. This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but likely structural in
origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
