LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  45 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old woman admitted on 09/27/2012, for altered mental status, rapid response code on 09/28/2012, for change in mental status.  This EEG is being performed to assess for a stroke versus seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, venlafaxine, Protonix, vancomycin, folic acid, thiamine, Zosyn, and Serax.  An additional 2 mg of Ativan was given during the recording for muscle artifact.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background is symmetric and continuous.  The background consists of very low amplitude fast activity without anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient. Nearly continuous EMG artifact is present over the bilateral lateral leads.
With stimulation there is an increase in EMG artifact diffusely, however, there is no discernible change in background.
No normal sleep architecture is captured.
A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of approximately 120 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:  Diffusely attenuated EEG with primarily beta background.  No clear electrographic seizures.  Nearly continuous EEG artifact over the bilateral lateral leads.  Tachycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 45-minute EEG due to diffusely low voltages and diffuse beta activity without clear normal organizations.  These findings indicate nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that in this case could partially be related to medication effect.  There is nearly continuous muscle artifact over the bilateral lateral leads that
limits interpretation of the recording.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.  Sinus tachycardia is observed in a single EKG lead.
