CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 68-year-old right-handed woman, who awoke in the hospital 2 months ago after a seizure, not otherwise described, hypertension and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Blood pressure medicine.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG, bradycardia.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a followup study may be of use.
