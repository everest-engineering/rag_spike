Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region and
occasionally on the right anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal regions (left much more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild  diffuse background
slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
