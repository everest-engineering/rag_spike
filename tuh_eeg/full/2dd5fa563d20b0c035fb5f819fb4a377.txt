CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old male with schizophrenia and epilepsy, learning disability.  The past EEGs with left frontocentral sharp transients.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, benztropine, hydroxyzine, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This adult had difficulty cooperating with testing.  Impedances were challenging and muscle artifact was difficult to eliminate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a well organized pattern with generous beta.  An 11 Hz alpha rhythm was noted with generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, a 5.6 hertz rhythmic, mid temporal theta was noted.  This may be identified unilaterally or bilaterally with most burst of 5-7 seconds in duration, some somewhat longer.
No slowing was noted following these bursts of 5.6 second activity.  The technologist was not able to test the patient during the bursts.  Afterwards, no impairment of awareness was noted.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta and may accentuate the 5.6 hertz activity.  Despite the muscle artifact, photic driving response was noted.
Heart rate 66 to 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This theta described above as the characteristics of a normal variant.  This EEG was remarkable for a significant amount of muscle artifact as well as the failure to perform testing during the discharges.  A follow-up study will be obtained to more completely evaluate this patient's cerebral pattern.
