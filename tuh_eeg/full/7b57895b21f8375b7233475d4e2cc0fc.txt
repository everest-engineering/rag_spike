CLINICAL HISTORY:  19-year-old with and epilepsy since age 5 or 6.  Seizure free for 10 years until he had 2 breakthrough seizures over 2 days with loss of consciousness, tongue biting, postictal confusion.  Headaches precede the seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 24-minute outpatient digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Impedances were acceptable under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  At best, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm but there is excess background theta.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of background delta some of which are a bit more posteriorly predominant.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and accentuated this finding.  As the patient became drowsy after hyperventilation, there was some shifting arrhythmic slowing a bit more prominent in the posterior regions.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

HEART RATE:  40 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Bursts of frontal slow delta.
3. Occasional shifting occipital slowing.
4. Bradycardia.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  To put this EEG in the proper context, it is important to know when this patient had his most recent seizures.  This may represent a postictal finding.  Comparison with previous EEGs is suggested.
The ordering physician will be contacted regarding the bradycardia.
