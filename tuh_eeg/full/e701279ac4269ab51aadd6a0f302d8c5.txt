History:	63 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF TBI 1984  WITH SUBSEQUENT SZS.
OSTEOMYELITIS, CEREBROVASCULAR SHUNT.  FOUND  PT ON FLOOR, ER
FOUND HYPOTHERMIC 87' PT TAKES TEGRETOL.  PER PT HAS BEEN YRS
SINCE HE HAD SZ. skull defect left
Medications:	TEGRETOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal mid temporal
and in the bilateral occipital regions.  Rare focal sharp waves are present in the left occipital
region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr is 96
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, few, left occipital
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral occipital
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of rare epileptiform discharges in the left occipital region.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition there is
continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal mid temporal region and in the bilateral
occipital regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesions in those regions. Lastly there
is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
