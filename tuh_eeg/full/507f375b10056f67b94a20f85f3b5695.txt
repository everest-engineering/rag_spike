CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with bilateral weakness, back pain, falling.  Now with staring spells for the past 4 days.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Diamox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed but photic stimulation was not possible.  This is a technically satisfactory study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG but in wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements, POSTS, and central theta.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and did not significantly activate the record.  The patient started to drift into stage 2 sleep following hyperventilation.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
