CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 77-year-old woman with a history of complex partial epilepsy with prolonged postictal confusion, dating to 2009.  Recent evaluation for stroke, status post tPA.  Dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, others
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG despite a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm ranging from 7-9 hertz.  There are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta noted from the right or left temporal region.
There is significant eye movement artifact and EKG artifact, but no definitive right temporal sharp waves.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
shifting and slowing primarily in the temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a 5th EEG for this patient.  EEGs dating to 2009 have demonstrated right temporal epileptiform activity and sharp waves, which was not clearly identified in a routine outpatient study.
