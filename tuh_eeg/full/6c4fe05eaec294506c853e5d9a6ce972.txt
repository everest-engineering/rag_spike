CLINICAL HISTORY:  83 year old female with hypertension, COPD, anemia, asthma, and AFib, found down by son, who had not seen the patient for at least 3 days and now currently in multiple organ failure.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported, but no sedating medications were given.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive and comatose.  No activating procedures were performed and no sleep was recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely attenuation, low-voltage recording with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  However, by increasing the voltages, there is still some mild cerebral activity seen in the delta-theta range, mainly in the delta range with some intermittent diffuse burst suppression.
No normal sleep architecture or activating procedures were performed.  However, when the patient was stimulated, there was no improvement in the frequencies.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves and marked low amplitude with intermittent burst suppression.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse or generalized slow waves.
Low-voltage attenuation with intermittent burst suppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  Please note that this recording was not measured on the electrocerebral sinus protocol, but some brain activity has been noted.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
