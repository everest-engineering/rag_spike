CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old right handed woman with high-grade left carotid stenosis.  This is a baseline for planned left carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medicines are aspirin, Norvasc, metoprolol, Advil, and isosorbide.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is primarily an awake EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz with 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Very brief drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal features were noted.  This baseline study will be used for this patient's long-term EEG monitoring session.
