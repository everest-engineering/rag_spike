CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed woman with hypertension, pulmonary nodule, kidney stones, and infantile seizures with left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Ondansetron, Ketorolac, Norvasc, Ciprofloxacin, Hydrochlorothiazide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits symmetric, bilateral driving. On rare occasions, there is some 5 Hz theta noted in the right occipital region, not on the left.  This is seen on 2 occasions with 2 isolated pairs of theta waves.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This asymmetry described above was seen on rare occasions and within the same period in the EEG that it is not clear represents pathology.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If additional information is need, a
follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep or capturing one of her seizures may be of value.
