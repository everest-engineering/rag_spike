CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old gentleman, status post severe closed head injury in 1986. A long history of epilepsy, but with a seizure in December with apnea. Severe, neurologic disability.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Tegretol, Ambien, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with some modification due to the patient's prior craniotomy and one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. Because of the patient's mobility, he is recorded sitting upright in a chair.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 7.5 hertz alpha rhythm. There is evidence of a breach rhythm with higher amplitude activity noted in the right frontal, left frontocentral region and at the midline. Head rocking artifact or craniotomy artifact Is noted in the posterior quadrant with Intermittent disruption the alpha rhythm on the right. Occasional, F8-T2 sharp waves are noted in wakefulness. Some sections of the record demonstrate more focality in terms of arrhythmic delta activity in the right mid temporal region and left right parietal region. Photic stimulation is remarkable for photoelectric artifact.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Modest background slowing from the left.
2. Superimposed focal slowing on the right with disruption of faster frequency activity and arrhythmic delta activity which can been seen in the right frontal or posterior regions.
3. Disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right.
4. Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structure or functional abnormality on the right more so than the left as well as a focal mechanism for seizures. Epileptiform activity was overall quite rare.
