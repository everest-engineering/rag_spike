CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed woman with refractory epilepsy status post hemispherectomy.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lamictal, Topamax

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry with relative attenuation of the activity from the right hemisphere. From the left hemisphere, the background is somewhat slow and disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm ranging from 7 Hz t o 9 Hz and a small amount of background theta. There are occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves noted. Photic stimulation does appear to elicit a driving response bilaterally.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing with attenuation of activity from the right.
2. Mild slowing from the left.
3. Rare left anterior temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a structural process on the right Involving gray and white matter. This EEG is similar to previous studies. The epileptiform activity on the left may be related to the dipole or to an epileptiform process on the left.
