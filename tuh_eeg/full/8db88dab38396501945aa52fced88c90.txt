CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old right handed female with seizures since age 13.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep stage 1 and stage 2 were recorded.  Activated procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with 20-60 microvolts amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  Sleep stage 1 and stage 2 are recorded.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized spike and wave seen with an anterior predominance at 2.5 to 3 Hz symmetrically with bursts lasting up to 15 seconds with no clinical symptoms seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spike and wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of cortical irritability seen with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  Although the burst is slightly slow in frequency at times,
they are mainly in the 3 Hz frequency.  Clinical correlation of generalized epilepsy syndrome is needed.  No seizures were seen.
