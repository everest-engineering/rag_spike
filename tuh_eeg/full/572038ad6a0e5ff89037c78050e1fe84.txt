REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures and episode of hypoglycemia.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old woman with complaints of seizures found to be hypoglycemic.  She has a past medical of diabetes, seizures, bipolar, anxiety, DVT in the lower extremity, and as per chart in Hospital had EEG monitoring and an event.  She was told that she was nonepileptic.  She had a prior EEG in 2009.

MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, insulin, Dilantin, Percocet, Lovenox, Ambien.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode  placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which was reactive to eye opening.  There was an excess amount of beta throughout the recording.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, produced no abnormal discharges.

Abnormal discharges:  None.

Heart rate:  96.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The excessive beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect seen with barbiturates or benzodiazepines.
