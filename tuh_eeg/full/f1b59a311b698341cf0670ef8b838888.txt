CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right handed female with onset seizures with prolonged aura, pins and needles.  The patient can feel her head turning or feel her throat closing.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz 70 MV alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by disruption of alpha rhythm.  Vertex waves, spindles, K-complexes, and POSTS are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in the background.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to previous studies and is normal.  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
