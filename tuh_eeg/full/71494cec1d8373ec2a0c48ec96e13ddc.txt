CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old male with hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal disease, motor vehicle accident with subsequent intracranial hemorrhage, felt short of breath and collapsed at home.  He was taken to the ER, 10 minutes of arrest on January 25, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed drip, Depakote, Heparin, Insulin, Dopamine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the recording.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background which at best has a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  There is no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There are generalized polyspike and spike and waves in bursts with anterior predominance seen symmetrically over both hemispheres at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz, which have most of the correlate seen in the video.
In between these bursts of generalized anterior predominant spike and waves, there is intermittent bursts of diffuse suppression that may last 2-3 seconds.
Some of these generalized spike and waves and polyspikes at times become rhythmic for about 1.5 seconds, which produce a tonic response seen on video.
SEIZURES:  Myoclonic and tonic events as described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Myoclonus, as well as a severely low amplitude.
Generalized slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction and cortical damage which is consistent with a hypoxic injury.  The multiple myoclonic seizures seen during the recording are suggestive of a poor prognosis.
