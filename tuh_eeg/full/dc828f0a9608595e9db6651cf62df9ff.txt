CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84-year-old with history of dementia, confusion, tremor.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, Namenda, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient suffers from involuntary oral movements which were recorded during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow, low voltage with an underlying asymmetry.  It appears to be a little slower in the posterior regions bilaterally and more so on the right compared to the left.  Involuntary chewing and other movements were not associated with a change in the EEG.
Photic stimulation was essentially obscured by the patient's chewing movements.  Hyperventilation could not be performed.
Heart rate irregular 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing, more remarkable in the posterior regions.
Mild asymmetry with a somewhat slower record on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The patient's involuntary movements were not associated with a change in the EEG.
