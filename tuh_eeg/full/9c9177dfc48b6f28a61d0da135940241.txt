CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed woman with multiple sclerosis. The patient has
had a recent upper respiratory tract infection, not sleeping well. She was having myoclonic or periodic leg movements of her legs in sleep. She woke up this morning with cramps and stiffness in her legs and then had an episode of what she described as a total hot or burning sensation rising up her body. She then became very nauseated and had repetitive vomiting which alleviated her symptoms. She was having difficulty walking at the time and fell.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Naprosyn
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1o-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record in a very drowsy patient
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined, 9-Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. Abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS are noted. On one or two occasions, the POSTS are a bit more spiky but there are not pathologic wave forms identified. Hyperventilation produces an Increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation does elicit a scant driving response although the patient is drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic.
HR: 84bpm
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The event this morning, with sleep disturbance, may play a role In
this patients hypersomnolence. No epileptiform features were seen and In this individual with demyelinating disease, there was no focal slowing.
