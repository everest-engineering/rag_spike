CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed gentleman with anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, hypertension, and 5-cm aneurysm of ascending aorta with aortic ectasia.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Isoflurane, Propofol, Fentanyl, Rocuronium, Solu-Medrol, Magnesium, Lidocaine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video Intraoperative EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system intraoperative montage with 1 channel EKG.  This was a 4-hour study with physician supervision.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording began at 9:45 a.m.  The patient was prepped.  The EEG demonstrated a sedated pattern with generous fast activity.  Because of the need for temperature monitors, the F7 and F8 electrodes were moved a little bit posteriorly and the anesthesiologist put a monitoring pack below the occipital region.  Despite these problems, there was a sedated pattern with generous fast activity.
The EEG begins to attenuate intermittently at 10:00 a.m.
Between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., as the patient is cooled and anesthetic medications are adjusted, the EEG transitions from a continuous pattern to intermittent attenuation and then burst suppression at 11:04.
Four mg of Versed were given at 11:04.  In addition, the Isoflurane dose was increased to 2.0.
Cooling began at 11:03.
At the time of cooling at 11:03 and 11:04, the EEG was becoming increasingly discontinuous.  In addition, there was Bovie artifact noted as well as other ICU artifacts, making EEG interpretation a bit more challenging.
As the Isoflurane is adjusted at 11:04, sharp waves were noted in the EEG, simple sharp waves in the right or left frontal region.  These sometimes seem to have a well-defined after-going slow wave.  Others are more evanescent and they disappear as the EEG transitions to a flat pattern with cooling at 11:08:02.
The aorta was cross-clamped and the patient was cooled for a total of 20 minutes.  From 11:09 to 11:22, there is a great deal of Bovie artifact.  There are a number of brief epochs including 11:28, where there is a low-voltage more continuous pattern, but again this is a little bit compromised by the Bovie artifact.
The EEG met the requisite 5-minute flat period between 11:07 and 11:12, but then with Bovie the EEG was partially obscured and then there was this very low-voltage EEG activity noted between 11:17 and 11:30.  These findings were reported to the team.
By 11:37, the EEG remained flat.
Total circulatory arrest was 20 minutes.
Following the circulatory arrest, the patient was gradually rewarmed.  The EEG activity slowly returned with bursts of activity noted at 12:34.  Bursts of activity were seen approximately every 30 seconds and were about 7 seconds in duration.  The bursts were relatively symmetric.
By 12:45, the EEG was increasingly symmetric, and by just after 1:00 p.m. the EEG was continuous..
A minor asymmetry was noted as the EEG became more continuous with a bit more slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
At the close of the record, electrode integrity is lost.  The EEG appears symmetric; however, this should be interpreted with caution, given the artifacts noted on the left.
HR:    66 to 72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This 4-hour intraoperative EEG was remarkable for:
Simple sharp waves noted with transition to a suppressed pattern with utilizing
Isoflurane at a concentration of 2.0 MAC. A slight asymmetry seen initially in the rewarming with a bit more delta on the right.
