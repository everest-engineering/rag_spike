History:	45 YR FEMALE WITH SZS.  PT STATES HAD SZ EARLIER THIS MONTH.  PRIOR

Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior and mid temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces occasional left
temporal slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
