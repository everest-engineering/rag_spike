CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old right handed man with a history of oligodendroglioma brain injury and tumor excision as well as seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures revealed no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen at C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts with an associated breach rhythm in that region (increased beta).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left central slowing and breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left central region, which is consistent with the known tumor and resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
