History:	79 Y/O FEMALE HOME WITH FAMILY AND SEEN EYES ROLL BACK ??
BACTERIAL MENINGITIS ONE HOUR STUDY ORDERED. PMHX.NO H/O SZ.
Medications:	PROPOFOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is intermittent attenuation diffusely. Intermittent fronto central beta/ alpha discharges can be
seen. With stimulation the background is reactive and becomes diffuse theta.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region,.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 hour EEG because of frequent focal slowing in the right anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
