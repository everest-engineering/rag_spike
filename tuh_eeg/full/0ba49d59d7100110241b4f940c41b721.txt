LENGTH OF RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures.  Up until last week she was seizure free for 3 years, off medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed in the laboratory.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Frequent polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left temporal region.  Similar activity to a lesser degree is noted over the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation was performed with a fair effort and results in no significant changes in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a sinus bradycardia with heart rate of approximately 56 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Bilateral, left greater than right, mild to moderate focal slowing.
No stage 2 sleep.
Sinus bradycardia, with heart rate of approximately 56 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 27-minute EEG due to bitemporal, left greater than right, intermittent focal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges were recorded, however, stage 2 sleep was not captured.  If clinical indications for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  A single EKG lead demonstrated a heart rate of approximately 56 beats per minute.
