History:	81 year old woman with change in mental status.
Medications:	Keppra, lasix, heparin, hydralazine, metoprolol, trazodone, amlodipine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal the PDR reaches polymorphic 8.5 Hz alpha activity.  The AP gradient is
weak.  Frequent 50-75uV, 4-7Hz waves are interspersed throughout the recording.  Patient remain
awake throughout the recording.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere, especially over the left
temporal region.  Less frequent polymorphic delta activity is noted over the right temporal region.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left, hemisphere, especially left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and continuous moderate left
hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left temporal region. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal
slowing in the left temporal region is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in
etiology.  Occasional right temporal slowing is not considered pathologic in patients over 65 years
of age.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
