History:	29 YO FEMALE HX OF NOCTURNAL SZ. LAST SZ WAS MAY 22ND, 2015. DEC
312015: HAD A SZ WHILE AWAKE.
Medications:	KEPPRA (RECENTLY INCREASED MAY 12TH 500 MG X2 TO 750 X2)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces focal slowing
in the left temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
