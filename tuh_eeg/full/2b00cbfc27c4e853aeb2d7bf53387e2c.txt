History:	PT PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ  ONSET AND DX WITH RT BRAIN TUMOR  X 3 YRS
AGO. PT STATES SZ ARE DURING SLEEP/ T-C LASTING 1-2 MIN.  WITH NO
RECALL OF EVENT. HAS NOT HAD A SZ IN A FEW MONTHS.
Medications:	Topamax, protonix and tramadol.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Deeper stages of sleep are seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 1 to 21 fps.  HR was72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL one hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Patient had a short sleep latency,
this is suggestive of a sleep disturbance.
