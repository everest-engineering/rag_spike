AGE: 18 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/12/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1667
HISTORY:
18 y.o. female with a history of asthma and memory problems referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz, 70 uV posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During - drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured; drowsiness characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: There is no change in the background activity to visual stimuli.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and minimally drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
