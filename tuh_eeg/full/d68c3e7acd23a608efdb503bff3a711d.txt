CLINICAL HISTORY:    61 year old male with a history of syncope with associated shaking of extremities with past medical history of hepatitis C, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol abuse and rib pain.

MEDICATIONS:  Thiamine, ASA, Heparin, Dextromethorphan.

REASON FOR STUDY:   Syncope versus seizure.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode anterior and temporal using an EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Hyperventilation was not performed, but stimulation was performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is multiple electrode artifact and sweat artifact throughout the recording which made this a very limited quality EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal fronto-temporal beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness. Activity and position is present with no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:    None.

SEIZURES:   None

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited poor quality EEG reveals no clear abnormal discharges.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  If seizures remain a question, a repeat EEG can be performed.
