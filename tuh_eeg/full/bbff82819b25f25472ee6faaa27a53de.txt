CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old right handed gentleman with a brief episode of
numbness and loss of control of the right leg while driving, past history of 2 seizures in
his lifetime, seizure-free for some years.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm of 30
microvolts with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. There is also attenuation of the alpha
rhythm and an increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of
the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Stage I sleep includes vertex
waves with brief stage II sleep demonstrating spindles.
HR: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
