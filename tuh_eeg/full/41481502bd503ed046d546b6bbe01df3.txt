CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right handed male in to evaluate for epilepsy and memory impairment This is a 33-year-old male with past history of meningitis and hydrocephalus or hypoencephalitis.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing prominent bursts of rhythm, high amplitude frontal delta, some of which is notched in conformation. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal adult may have prominent hyperventilation in response as described above and there was no definitive epileptiform activity. However, if epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing including a sleep deprived fasting study in the morning may be helpful to evaluate potential underlying epileptiform activity. A past history of hydrocephalus might have a role in the prominent hyperventilation response described above.
