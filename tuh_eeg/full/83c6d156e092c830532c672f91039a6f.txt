AGE: 70 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 10/2522015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Inpatient Rm 771
EEG TYPE: routine 22 minutes at 14:19 PM bedside portable EEG #: 15-1567
HISTORY: 70 y.o. male with a history of acute
right frontal stroke referred for routine EEG for tremor.
MEDICATIONS:
Labetalol SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.	There was significant tremor noted in the record.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.	Intermittent bilateral excess theta was noted in the background.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements , attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Intermittent generalized slowing is present.	Limited, shifting focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: None EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is abnormal bedside portable routine EEG.
Intermittent excess theta
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is routine EEG did not demonstrate significant focal slowing, though muscle artifact may have masked minor focal
features. The excess theta and shifting slowing may be correlated with the clinical picture . An underlying encephalopathy or ischemic cerebral vascular disease can produce this pattern.
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
