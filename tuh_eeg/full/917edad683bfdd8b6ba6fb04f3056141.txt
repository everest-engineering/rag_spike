History:	48 year old woman with history of strokes and seizures, now presents with change in
mental status and increase in seizure frequency.
Medications:	Dilantin, Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Occasional brief background discontinuity is noted.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp
waves with triphasic morphology are occasionally present.  These waveforms demonstrate an
anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No clear focal slowing is present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, occasional
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG because of diffuse background slowing and occasional
triphasic waveforms.  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Triphasic waveforms are seen in
various forms of encephalopathy.  No electrographic seizures are present.
