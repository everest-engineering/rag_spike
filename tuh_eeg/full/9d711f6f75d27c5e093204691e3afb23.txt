History:	20 year old female with history of possible seizures. Currently, 13 weeks pregnant.
Last seizure was 3/7/2014.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a modest symmetric photic
driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A normal EEG does not rule out the clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG.
