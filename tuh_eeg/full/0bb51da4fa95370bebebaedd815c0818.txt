CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old woman, admitted on 08/03/2010 for wound infection. Temperature of 105. History of MVA in April, status post craniectomy with episodes of left arm and eye twitching lasting 30-40 minutes, status post 10 mg Ativan, 10 mg Versed, 600 mg phenobarbital.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ativan, Versed
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable EEG for an intubated patient demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern. The overall background is slow, featureless delta. The breech rhythm is observed with a scant amount of faster frequencies picked up in the left frontal region. Sharply contoured left frontal delta is noted in that region as well. A sharp wave contoured delta is noted in the left frontal region with a double phase reversal across the left cranium. Stimulation of the patient does not substantially impact the EEG.
HR: 150 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background with markedly slow delta.
2. Sharply contoured slowing in the left frontal region.
3. Occasional beta activity in the left frontal region.
4. There were no seizures recorded and no facial twitching was observed.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bi-hemispheric, severe disturbance of cerebral function. The sharply contoured delta is in the region of the patient craniectomy.
