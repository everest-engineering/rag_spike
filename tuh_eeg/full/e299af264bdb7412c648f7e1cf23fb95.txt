CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old woman with 1 year history of epilepsy, 3-4 tonic clonic seizures for which she has no auras. Most seizures were attributed to either cocaine ingestion or benzodiazepine withdrawal.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, multiple retrovirals, multiple psychiatric medications.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized. There is a mixed frequency pattern with rhythmic theta, delta, and some alpha frequency activity. There are bursts of paroxysmal slowing and there is a suggestion of a bit more slowing in the right.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Marked background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Bursts of FIRDA.
4. Shifting asymmetries, but with at least some occasions the suggestion of more slowing on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or due to postictal state. A follow up study as an outpatient is suggested.
