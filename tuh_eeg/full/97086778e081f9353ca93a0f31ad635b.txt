CLINICAL HISTORY:   67 year old man with a history of altered mental status while having dialysis.  Per the wife, there is left facial droop.  CT showed new frontoparietal infarct.  The patient has bilateral eye blindness, CAD, diabetes, and CVA on the left side.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Pantoprazole, Carvedilol, ASA, Nifedipine, Hydralazine, Clonidine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Altered mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There was no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures are recorded.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  At times it become very rhythmic.
Triphasic waves at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts seen predominantly anteriorly, although sometimes asymmetrically.  Not occurring continuously throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized slow waves and triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which may be due, at least in part, to a metabolic derangement.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
