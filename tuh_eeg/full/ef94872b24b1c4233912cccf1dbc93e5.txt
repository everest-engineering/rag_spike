History:	61 year old male status post repair of aortic aneurysm with change in mental status.
Medications:	None
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  The background is characterized by diffuse
attenuation even at recording sensitivities of 3 microvolts.  No sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  global and severe amplitude attenuation.  There are no
normal cerebral rhythms seen.  These findings may be indicative of severe and global brain injury.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
