History:	84 year old who presents with right sided weakness and expressive aphasia.  Patient
has a history of a prior stroke.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is right-to-left asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  There is no clear PDR or AP
gradient.  Additionally, patient is agitated and moves nearly continuously throughout the recording.
The background over the right consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta activity with
attenuation of voltages over posteriorly.  The background over the left consists of a mixture of
attenuated slow theta and delta activity.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No clear electrographic seizures are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  An irregular heart rate is noted over a
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Artifact, movement, abundant
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric

Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Technically limited
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because of abundant EMG and electrode artifacts. This
portable 22-minute awake-only EEG is notable for mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing and continuous
left hemispheric attenuation and moderate focal slowing.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild to
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing
is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left but it also could be post-ictal phenomenon.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
