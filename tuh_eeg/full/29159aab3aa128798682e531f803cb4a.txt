DATE OF STUDY:  03/06/2013 through 03/07/2013
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  During this 24 hour session of the recording, no clinical seizures were noted by patient, nurse, or the computer.  In addition, the patient's medications had been adjusted.  The Keppra was increased.  The Lamictal level on admission was considerably lower than her usual outpatient level.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background of the EEG is well organized.  In drowsiness, there is some rhythmic background slowing.  Upon stage II sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts were identified. Deeper stages of sleep, including slow-wave sleep with higher amplitude 2 Hz delta was noted.
Lambda and other normal variants were noted.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This long-term video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
A single tonic-clonic seizure identified during the first night of admission, which was generalized in onset with symmetric, frontally predominantly spike-and-wave activity.
Extremely rare, generalized spike-and-wave activity, primarily seen following the seizure, but also sometimes in association with vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  By the end of the EEG recording, additional epileptiform activity was very difficult to identify.  Overall, this EEG is primarily supportive of a generalized mechanism for epilepsy as seen in inherited epilepsy.  The patient may also be somewhat sleep deprived given the predominance of deeper stages of sleep.
