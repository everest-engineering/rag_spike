CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed woman with refractory epilepsy. Last seizure 3
weeks ago. Past history of head trauma.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Carbamazepine, Levetiracetam, Zolpidem, Cyclobenzaprine
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm presently
bilaterally. Central mu activity is noted in the frontal central regions at 8Hz. Testing is not
performed to confirm this, however. There is a small amount of bilateral background theta In
addition, there is superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere with description of faster
frequency activity on the right. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and generates
occasional bursts of sharp waves from the left mid temporal region. Features of drowsiness
include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm drops out on the right before the
left. During photic stimulation there were bursts of left temporal sharp waves. On rare occasion
left posterior temporal sharp waves are also observed.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere characterized by rhythmic slowing and disruption
of faster frequency activity on the right.
2. Left mid temporal sharp waves.
3. Excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third EEG for this individual in 2 years. This is the first
EEG that has demonstrated sharp waves contralateral to the right side focal
slowing.
