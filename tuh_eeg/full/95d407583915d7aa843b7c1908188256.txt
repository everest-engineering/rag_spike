CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed female with 3 episodes of eyes rolling back with loss of consciousness and confusion. Has history of previous right MCA stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Trazodone, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION; Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG is disorganized with a theta background. There is 6 Hz alpha seen on the left, which is not present on the right. There are sharp waves in right anterior temporal, mid temporal, and posterior region, which are not the same with generous area of epileptogenicity. Faster frequency is seen on the left at 10 Hz. Both hemispheres are abnormal, right more than the left, with arrhythmic delta bilaterally.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION; Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Disorganized background.
2. Sharp waves in right anterior temporal and posterior region.
3. Focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with structural abnormality with an irritative focus on the right. This study also supports bihemispheric process with noted sharp waves on the left and right.
