AGE: 54 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY : 09/29/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG # : 15-1428
HISTORY:
54 y.o. Female with a history of medically intractable epilepsy with prior documented right temporal seizures, s/p R temporal lobectomy, referred for routine EEG for pre-surgical evaluation.
MEDICATIONS :
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
VIMPAT 200 mg Tablet, Take 200 mg by mouth 2 times daily. metoprolol (LOPRESSOR) 50 mg tablet, take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day
ergocalciferol, Vitamin D2, (VITAMIN D) 50,000 unit Capsule, Take 50,000 Units by mouth once a week.

Arm Brace (FUTURO RIGHT HAND WRIST BRACE) Misc, by
Misc. (Non-Drug; Combo Route) route. nightly SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is abundant right temporal (T4 max) polymorphic slowing. There is a right temporal (T4 max) breach rhythm.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and drowsy	routine EEG due to:
Abundant right temporal polymorphic slowing
Right temporal breach rhythm
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are indicative of right temporal cerebral dysfunction. A right temporal breach rhythm is consistent with this patient' s known prior history of craniotomy.
