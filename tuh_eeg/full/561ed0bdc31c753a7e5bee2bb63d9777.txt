History:	68 YO MALE R HANDED. PT CAME FROM ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON WITH SOB
AND FLUID AROUND HIS HEART.PMHX PT HAD A STROKE ON THE 14TH. PMHX.
DM,HTN,HEART ISSUES, MEMORY LOSS.
Medications:	INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an PDR that at best reaches 7Hz.  Background activity is
predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Intermittent brief bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal polymorphic 1 to 2
Hz, 80-100 uV slow waves are observed during wakefulness.  No sleep is recorded
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 96  Technical difficulties: Very
frequent movement artifact was seen throughout the study.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Disorganization, continuous, marked diffuse
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing,
disorganization, FIRDA and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
