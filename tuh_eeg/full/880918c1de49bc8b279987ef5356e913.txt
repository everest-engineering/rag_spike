History:	87 year old man with a history of stroke, dementia and seizures, now presents with a
seizure and change in MS.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with lack of PDR or AP gradient over the left
hemisphere.  The background over the right consists of 8-8.5 Hz PDR with expected AP gradient.
The background over the left consists of polymorphic slow delta activity with continuous quasi-
periodic (quasi-PLEDs) sharp waves at 0.75-1 Hz with maximal scalp negativity over F3/C3
electrodes.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No electrographic seizures are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Diffuse EMG artifact that is more
pronounced over the left is frequently seen and obscures some portions of the recording.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe
Other, continuous, left frontal, quasi-PLEDs, frontocentral
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is a very ABNORMAL 21-minute awake-only EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing, (2)
continuous severe left hemispheric slowing and (3) continuous left frontocentral quasi-periodic
epileptiform discharges (quasi-PLEDs). Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and frequent epileptiform
discharges in the left frontocentral region are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal
structural lesion in the left hemisphere, notably frontocentral region.  These findings were conveyed
to the primary team.  Patient will be placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
