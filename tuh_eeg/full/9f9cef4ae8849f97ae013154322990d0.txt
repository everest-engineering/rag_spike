History:	84 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH CHEST PAIN, TX FOR THORACIC
AORTIC ANEURYSM REPAIR S/P TEVAR W/GRAFT PLMT ON 4/25/14. SINCE
THEN PT NOTED WITH POST-OP CONFUSION. PER FAMILY PT WAS
CONFUSED 10 DAYS PRIOR TO SURGERY.
Medications:	No AEDs.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by alpha rhythm that at best reaches 7Hz.  Background consists
central alpha frequencies intermixed with more diffuse theta/delta.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to delta activity and during stage 1-2 some vertex are seen and later some
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left parietal and right central region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60 irregular and with PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left parietal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of focal slowing in the left parietal
and right central region in addition to diffuse background slowing .  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
