History:	57 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  FOUND HAVING DIFFICULTY
BREATHING, DEVELOPED V-FIB-CPR W/CARDIOVERSION LASTING 10-15 MIN,
HYPOTENSION POST INTUBATION.
Medications:	HEPARIN, CEFEPIME
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present and at best reached 6 Hz.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior
to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Intermittent short periods of diffuse attenuation can be seen.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 108  Technical difficulties: Almost continuous eye blinking artifact
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, few diffuse
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm with
intermittent attenuation.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
