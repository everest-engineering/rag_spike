History:	81 yo p/w difficulty speaking. L CVA (embolic) MCA, R hemiplegia. PMHx: DM,
HTN,  HLD
Medications:	Coumadin, ASA, Synthroid, Norvasc, Imdur, Prilosec, Donepezil
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, best seen over the right.  5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over right hemisphere.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75
uV, 5-8Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic
delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
