CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old male with Parkinson disease, tremors, psychosis, dementia, possible seizures with episode of shaking in the context of sepsis and hypotension earlier today.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vanco, ASA, Haldol, Zosyn, Clonidine, Ativan

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and relatively obtunded during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, continuous pattern rich in alpha and beta frequency activity. Prominent, frontal 14 Hz activity is observed as well as 10-11 Hz activity in the central region. There is a small degree of background variability in the record. Very minimal stimulation of the patient occurs during the EEG.
HR: 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mixed frequency background rich in beta and alpha frequency activity but also some theta and delta.
2. What appears to be a pattern of pharmacologic coma with a decrease in faster frequency at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. Inadequate tactile stimulation was performed to determine that the patient's reactivity to external stimuli.
