CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old gentleman recently admitted for repetitive seizures, recent subclinical seizure during the EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic  stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall background is somewhat low voltage, but there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a subtle asymmetry noted with slowing in the right hemisphere.  There is disruption of the alpha rhythm and subtle underlying theta and sometimes delta.   As the patient becomes drowsy with an increase in beta the focal slowing becomes a bit prominent. Rare Stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles was identified.

Photic stimulation elicited vigorous, bilateral driving.  Heart rate 90 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing from the right hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG, no seizures were recorded today.  The subtle focal slowing may be correlated with imaging.  The previous EEG raised the possibility of a subclinical, brief frontal seizure noted only at the close of the record.  If additional information is noted or if the patient is still having seizures, additional recording may be of value.
