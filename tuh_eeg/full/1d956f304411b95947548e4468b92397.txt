INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hertz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness Is
characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta. There are occasional bursts of slowing
in the temporal regions left more so than the right as the patient becomes drowsy.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
