History:	52 year old man undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, requiring
hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass.
Medications:	INDUCTION MEDS: ETOMIDATE, FENTANYL, VERSED, ROCURONIUM
ISOFLURANE DURING SURGERY
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
Patient is intubated and sedated by the onset of the recording.  As the recording opens the
background demonstrates discontinuity and a mixture of frequencies.  As the recording progresses
and the temperature decreases, the background voltages gradually decrease and fast frequencies
disappear.  At ~10 AM, monomorphic artifact affecting all of the right hemispheric leads appears.
It is related to the cooling device used.  It resolves by ~ 10:36 AM, after the cooling device is
repositioned.  Additionally, there is F8 lead artifact.  The background gradually becomes
suppressed with only rare bursts of brief slow attenuated delta activity captured.  EEG is not
declared isoelectric at any time during the recording, since no inquires are made by either
anesthesia or the surgeon.  Burst of activity reappear at ~11:44 AM.  By the end of the recording, the
background is nearly continuous and symmetrical, consisting of a mixture of frequencies (primarily
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Other, symmetrical
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable 3 hour 44 minute continuous intraoperative EEG monitoring with ~3 hours
of direct remote supervision by the attending. EEG is not declared isoelectric at any time during the
recording, since no inquires are made by either anesthesia or the surgeon.  The background is
symmetrical when the recording ends.
