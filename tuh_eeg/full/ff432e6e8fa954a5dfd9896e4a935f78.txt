CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old woman with epilepsy and headaches.  She suffered a head injury with a concussion and now has seizures every 1-2 weeks with dry mouth, dizziness, ataxia, and tonic-clonic activity.  Past history a bipolar disease, breast cancer, and family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote, Tegretol, and Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a pattern with generous beta.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing a small increase in amplitude of the background and a small amount of theta.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Stage II was characterized by prominent posts and spindles with less prominent vertex activity.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient is falling asleep, but did elicit scant driving.  Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this patient with refractory seizures on multiple medications, a follow-up study to more completely characterize her epilepsy is suggested.
