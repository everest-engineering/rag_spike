CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old with childhood epilepsy since age 9, typically nocturnal seizures or provoked seizures.  Increasing seizures in 2012.  The patient is a former twin.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive, alpha rhythm of 11 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
As the patient transitions into stage I sleep, there is a very subtle asymmetry with 2 bursts that are just to the left of the midline.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep, which is on the whole, symmetric.
Hyperventilation produces no change in the background.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is essentially within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is 2 slightly asynchronous bursts noted in the transition to sleep.  Head measurement could account for this and therefore 2 bursts should not necessarily be considered indicative of focal pathology.
