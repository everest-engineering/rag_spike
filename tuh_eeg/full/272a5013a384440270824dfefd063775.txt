CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed female with hydrocephalus status post shunt. The patient reports headaches, nausea, vomiting, and amnesia for 2 days. This was associated with incontinence. She is postoperative day 52 after shunt revision and valve replacement, status post right burr hole.
MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Demerol, Lovenox, Keppra, Lamictal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somewhat drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in wakefulness is slow and disorganized. The posterior dominant rhythm is theta frequency, approximately 5 to 7 Hz. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing. There is a breach rhythm characterized by higher amplitude activity in the right central region. POSTS are noted in stage I sleep. Some hypersynchronous bursts are noted as the patient
transitions in and out of sleep.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Somewhat slow and disorganized pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no focal or epileptiform features identified today. The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function of many different causes including hydrocephalus. The amplitude asymmetry is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
