History:	25 year old woman with a history of episodic loss of vision and head shakes, lasting
1-2 seconds.  These episodes occur 1-2 times per week.  Their frequency has
recently increased.  Last such episode occurred this morning.
Medications:	none
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour awake and asleep EEG. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
