History:	47 year old woman with a history of aneurysms, SAH, bilateral MCA territories,
Medications:	Keppra, Amlodipine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions
(left>right, increasing during hyperventilation.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates heart rate of ~100 bpm and occasional premature QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the
bilateral anterior temporal regions, left>right.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of
~100 bpm and occasional premature QRS complexes.
