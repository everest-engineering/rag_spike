REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old man with a history of stroke, right temporal, and seizures, now with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, carbamazepine, omeprazole, lisinopril, and amlodipine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact, mainly over the left hemisphere, seen continuously.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 during wakefulness and drowsiness, as well as F8/T4, also during wakefulness and drowsiness (slightly more on the left than the right).
Focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts, almost continuously throughout the recording.  In addition, there is some intermittent F7/T3 focal slowing at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves as well as independent focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal lobes.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction which is independently seen in both anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
