CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old woman who is 24-weeks pregnant.  The patient had an episode of loss of consciousness/fall.  While unconscious, jerking at the hip was noted.  Of note, patient felt dizzy prior to an episode.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and regulated moderate amplitude 9-9.5 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Excess beta is observed.  During sleep, vertex waves, sleep spindle and POSTS are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in no change in the background.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.
FINDINGS:  No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep approximately 24-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
