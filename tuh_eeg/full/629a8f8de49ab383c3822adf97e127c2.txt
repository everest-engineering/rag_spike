CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old gentleman status post PEA code for 20 minutes on
October 11, 2011, status post multiple resuscitations with CPR. Past history of
encephalitis, HIV disease. Evaluate for anoxic brain injury.
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Heparin, Pepcid.
INTRODUCTIONS: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and
appears to be unresponsive, but has frequent eye movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and
suppressed. There is low voltage muscle artifact and frequent eye movement. When
the patient opens his eyes the muscle artifact drops out and there seems to be a very low voltage suppressed pattern.
HR: 60-80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage markedly suppressed pattern.
2. Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG recorded more than 72 hours after an anoxic
insult carries a worrisome prognosis. If there are additional questions, consideration for a study with a neuromuscular blocking agent may be appropriate. Alternatively, other neurophysiologic or neurodiagnostic tests may be more informative.
