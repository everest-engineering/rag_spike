HISTORY: A 40-year-old right-handed woman with recurrent black out spells, seizures, and auras. Some of her seizures are described as lip-smacking with an involuntary noise. The patient is aware of the noise but cannot stop the behavior. Concomitant migraine headaches and lupus.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Carbatrol.
This is an outpatient EEG #10-308 recorded on March 5, 2010

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz 40 uV alpha rhythm with a small I amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha. Hyperventilation does not alter the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 BPM.
Impression: Normal EEG

Clinical Correlation: If further characterization of the epileptic focus is needed, additional recording is suggested.
