CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 22-year-old football player, who had just completed football practice, was found motionless, limp, arousable, but confused.  The patient has been having sporadic dizzy spells and was amnestic for the event.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a high amplitude, youthful appearing pattern.  There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes greater than 100 microvolts.  Alpha squeak was identified.  Abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs were noted.  The patient seemed to be quite drowsy, and quickly transitioned in and out of stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation seemed to keep the patient awake, but he was drifting off to sleep in the end of it.  The patient was transitioned into stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  66 bpm .
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study may be of use.
