CLINICAL HISTORY: 88 year old right handed woman with dementia, recent falling and staring spells but no known seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Xalatan, Aricept, Lisinopril, Levothyroxine, Simvastatin, Pantoprazole, Dorzolamide, Venlafaxine,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is noted to be chilly and has a little bit of shivering but is cooperative.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background includes a somewhat slow posterior dominant rhythm of 6.8 to 7.3 Hz. There is a small amount of shifting arrhythmic delta. As the patient becomes drowsy there are occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Towards the end of photic stimulation, there is some sharply contoured slowing, particularly in the left parietal region.

HR: 60 to 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Some sharply contoured slowing in the posterior regions, left more so than the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse cerebral process which may include dementia. No definite sharp waves were seen.
