electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric supraharmonic photic driving.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep
was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
