History:	84 YEAR OLD MALE LEFT HANDED WITH PMHX OF DEMENTIA NOW WITH CHG
IN MENTAL STATUS.PT HAD A FALL 3 DAYS AGO NO LOC. SEEMS CONFUSED
AND DISORIENTED.
Medications:	ceftriaxone, B12, multivitamin, colace, senna, lipitor, donepezil, coreg, aspirin,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Briefly, a 6.5-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm was seen, however the majority of the record  was
characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior
to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
There were occasional bursts of focal slowing in the left hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 72  The record is obscured by
excess muscle and EMG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and occasional focal left
hemisphere slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
and focal cerebral dysfunction.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG and movement artifact.
If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG with sedation in the lab.
