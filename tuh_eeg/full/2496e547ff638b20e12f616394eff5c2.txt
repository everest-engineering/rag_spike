REASON FOR STUDY:  Memory and concentration problems.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 32-year-old man who had a traumatic subdural hemorrhage in November of 2011, and now with memory and concentration problems and right-sided migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Cannot remember.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1 and stage 2.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EPISODES DURING THE RECORDING:  There is an episode lasting about a minute where the patient was not responsive to questions or commands.  He suddenly opened his eyes and responded to commands.  Later on, doctor came in to examine and he was answering questions slightly slow.  During the episode, he remained normal with no abnormal discharges of epileptiform activity.
HEAR RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the episodes where the patient was unresponsive showed a normal awake background and no epileptiform activity was seen.  This is consistent with a nonepileptic spell of unclear etiology, possibly psychogenic.
