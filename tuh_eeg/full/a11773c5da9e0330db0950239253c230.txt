HISTORY: An elderly woman with change in menial status, waxing and waning mental status, COPD, morbid obesity, and markedly abnormal EEG. Digital EEG was done on June 27, 2011.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of
EKG. The patient is sitting out of her bed. She is very confused and poorly cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: Much of the EEG includes muscle artifact. When she is cooperative, there is a theta pattern with bursts of frontal delta. Muscle artifact is remarkable when the patient becomes a bit more agitated.
As she goes off to sleep, the deltas slowed considerably. There are handful of triphasic waves noted.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal EEG due to
1. Prominent versus frontally predominant rhythmic delta.
2 Excess beta.
3 Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to last weeks two prior EEGs. Sometimes, the FIRDA is notched, but over all, this is a metabolic pattern.
