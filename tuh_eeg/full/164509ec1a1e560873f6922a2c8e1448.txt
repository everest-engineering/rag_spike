History:	29 year old woman who became progressively less responsive today during
hemodialysis.
Medications:	sedation used for intubation and propofol that is now stopped
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation, the background consists of  attenuated slow
delta activity, periods of discontinuity and diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms.  During periods of
quiescence, the background becomes more continuous and faster frequencies appear.  No normal
sleep architecture is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~120-130 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate to severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 20-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but at least partially related to the medication effect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
heart rate of ~120-130 bpm.
