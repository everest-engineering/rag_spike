Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of rare focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
