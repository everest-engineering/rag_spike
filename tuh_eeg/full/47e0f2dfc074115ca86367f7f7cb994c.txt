CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 47-year-old woman with Angelman syndrome, pica, OCD, tremors and recent increase in seizures after medications were changed to of her hyperammonemia and hyponatremia medicines.
MEDICATIONS:   Keppra, Vimpat, clonazepam, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was moving about and was so tremulous prior to the EEG that she required Ativan to sit still to have the electrodes placed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is awake with eyes open and looking above.  The background EEG is markedly abnormal with diffuse theta and a paucity of the normal waveforms expected.  The patient has intermittent tremulousness of the upper extremities, particularly the left, although the camera is on the patient's left, and she intermittently has some myoclonic jerking.  These are difficult to associate with the epileptiform activity in the EEG, which includes an occipitally predominant slow spike and wave complex as well as focal epileptiform activity at T6 and T4.  The frequency of the patient's tremor is approximately 5 hertz, which is significantly faster than the epileptiform activity noted.  Briefly in the record, the patient drifts off to sleep in the ED and muscle activity drops out.  The record is more of rhythmic delta theta pattern.  With arousals, the patient seems to have spastic movements and twitching, which produced with 5 hertz artifact.
Heart rate: 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to.
Replacement of normal background with a diffusely slow pattern.
Prominent, almost continuous, but not evolving epileptiform activity in the occipital regions present bilaterally right more so than the left.
Focal sharp waves noted in the record.
Intermittent 5 hertz spastic or tremulous-like activity, which does not carry an EEG signature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Given this patient's recent increase in seizures, long-term monitoring was initiated.
