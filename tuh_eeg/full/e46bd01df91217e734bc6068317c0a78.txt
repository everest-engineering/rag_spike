CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed woman with a 2 year history of tonic clonic seizure, last seizure a year ago described as dizziness followed by tonic-clonic activity with loss of consciousness and postictal amnesia. History of depression.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well-organized with 11 an
Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is needed, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
