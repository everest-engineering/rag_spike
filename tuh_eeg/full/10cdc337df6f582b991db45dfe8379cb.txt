system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness there is a well organized
posterior rhythm of 11 Hertz in addition to 17 microvolts of voltage. In addition, eye
flutter is observed during the record. During hyperventilation there is rhythmic slowing.
In addition, photic stimulation generates a harmonic driving from 7 Hertz to 14 Hertz.
