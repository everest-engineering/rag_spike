CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 31-year-old woman with atypical multiple sclerosis versus migraine headache, admitted with left sided tingling, numbness, and acute demyelinating lesions.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Solu-Medrol, Reglan, Toradol, Neurontin, insulin, Celexa, Motrin, Zocor, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG was somewhat slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm of approximately 8 Hz.  Prominent shifting slowing was noted.  In addition, there were bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic frontal delta and some bursts of sharply contoured slowing on the right or left.  In this sharply contoured record, there are rare T4 sharp waves.
Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  A bit more focal slowing also develops in the right hemisphere, including right posterior temporal region.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
FIRDA.
Sharply contoured slowing, right more so than the left.
Rare right central temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's background slowing and paroxysmal features should be considered in the context of her neuro imaging, but toxic or
metabolic causes may also be considered.  Medication effect may also contribute to the background slowing.
