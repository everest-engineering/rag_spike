CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old male with 2.5 year history of epilepsy.  Recent increase in seizures, July 18th, with increasing seizures with medication changes.  Impaired memory.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 microvolts with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  Frequent eye blink artifact is noted in wakefulness and hyperventilation.
Intermittent, subtle, focal slowing was identified in the right temporal region with subtle underlying right temporal sharp waves noted in relaxed wakefulness and hyperventilation.  In addition, there are rare, subtle, left frontal or frontotemporal sharp waves noted.  Stage 1 sleep demonstrated vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  In addition, in photic stimulation there is rhythmic left temporal frontal theta with more of an AFP1 F7 localization with more clear focal theta and underlying sharp waves.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Discrete right temporal sharp waves with right temporal focal slowing.
Left frontotemporal more sustained focal slowing and subtle underlying sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to a previous study, October 19, 2012.  They support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  The previous EEG.  Also demonstrated independent, right or left temporal epileptiform features, as identified today.
