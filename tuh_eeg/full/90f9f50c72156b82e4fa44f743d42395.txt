CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old male with epilepsy since age 14, recurrent tonic-clonic seizures, seizures began with a buzz in his ears, consistently low anti-epileptic drug levels.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG, although T1-T2 electrodes had impedances greater than 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was falling off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Of note, although most of the vertex waves and K complexes are symmetric, there are rare waveforms which have a slight asymmetry and are slightly maximum in terms of the field on the right, although the phase reversal is at CZ.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Slightly asymmetric vertex waves and K complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted. This is not a clear example of dyshormia.  If additional information is needed to characterize his epilepsy, a more prolonged study may be obtained.
