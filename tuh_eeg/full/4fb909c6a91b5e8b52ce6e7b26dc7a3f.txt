CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old gentleman who had a fall with loss of consciousness 2 years ago.  The patient reports multiple episodes with dizziness followed by syncope and is now experiencing forgetfulness and short term memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The technologist noted problematic impedance which she could not resolve.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions rapidly from wakefulness into stage I and even brief epochs of stage II sleep.  He was falling asleep during hyperventilation.  Sleep was not particularly sustained and intermittent, spontaneous arousals were observed.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record significantly.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record significantly.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The sleep pattern described above is a nonspecific pattern.  An individual with an underlying sleep disturbance may demonstrate micro sleeps.  In addition, an individual who is trying to
get to sleep but is intermittently disrupted may also demonstrate the same pattern.  These findings may contribute to the memory complaint.
