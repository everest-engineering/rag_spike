CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old woman status post code October 12, for 3-5 minutes.  Intraoperative code during prolonged pelvic surgery.  Placental abruption, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, bleeding diathesis attributed to cocaine.  Two seizures on October 13.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Bolus, Midazolam, Heparin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous, low-voltage pattern with a mixture of 4-5 Hz activity and lower voltage, 1-2 Hz delta activity.  There are intermittent, brief attenuations.  The overall record is relatively symmetric.  There is a bit more muscle on the right. Stimulation of the patient seems to produce an attenuation.
HR:    150 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Attenuation of cerebral activity with tactile stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This background slowing identified in this EEG can be attributed to medications.  The attenuation pattern is more suggestive of a process of cerebral dysfunction.  There are no significant focal features and there are no
epileptiform features.  Although sedative hypnotic medications can produce background slowing, this EEG pattern may also be a reflection of anoxic insult.
