History:	68 year old woman who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of 7 Hz polymorphic theta activity.  AP gradient is weak.
Diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During brief
drowsiness, the degree of EMG artifact decreases and amount of diffuse theta activity increases.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
