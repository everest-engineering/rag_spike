CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old male with childhood epilepsy characterized as an
aura of the room spinning, feeling of falling followed by generalized shaking lasting 15-
30 minutes. No other past medical history.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized with an alpha rhythm of 7.5 Hz. There is a small amount of theta and a
small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
an increase in slowing. In addition, there is a little bit of subtle focal slowing in the right posterior temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving at intermediate flash frequencies.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. Disorganization for age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is little sustained sleep. To more completely
evaluate the right posterior temporal slowing, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of
sleep is suggested. No epileptiform features were noted today.
