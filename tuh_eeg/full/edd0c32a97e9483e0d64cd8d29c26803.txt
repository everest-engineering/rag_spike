CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman admitted with severe chest pain on Christmas Day, found unresponsive at the bus and had 2 cardiac resuscitations lasting 15 minutes.

MEDICATIONS:  Antibiotics, famotidine, dopamine, no sedative or hypnotics.

INTRODUCTION:  A 57-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was stimulated during the EEG.  The recording did include the ECS montage.  The data was reviewed with conventional montage, average reference and the ECS montage.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  No definitive cerebral activity was identified.  Stimulation of the patient did not produce an alteration in the background.  Electrode integrity was checked briefly by the tech.

Heart rate 115 BMP.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for the absence of cerebral activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In the appropriate clinical context, this EEG would fulfill the criteria for electrocerebral silence.
