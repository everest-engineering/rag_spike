CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed gentleman with right carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Versed, Fentanyl
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The recording begins at 1401 and concludes at 16:45. This is a 2 hour and 45 minute study. Standard CEA montage is recorded. The record concludes after patency is confirmed by Doppler. As the tracing begins, the patient has already received anesthetic medications. The overall EEG is relatively symmetric with a mixed frequency pattern with generous theta and delta. Head rocking artifact is noted in the background. As anesthetic medications are adjusted at 14:06, the EEG starts to be subtly
discontinuous and it is a bit more discontinuous in the right hemisphere compared to the left. Heparin is given at 15:07. The clamp is placed across the carotid at 15:17:48. It is unclamped at 16:16:33. Patency is conformed by Doppler at 16:35. No additional focal
features were noted after placement of the clamp across the carotid. The slight asymmetry with a bit of attenuation of the posterior quadrant is abating at the close of the record as the level of anesthesia changes.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring of this right carotid
endarterectomy was remarkable for some subtle focal seizures which emerged when the patient had an adjustment of anesthesia, but no additional focal features with placement of the clamp.
