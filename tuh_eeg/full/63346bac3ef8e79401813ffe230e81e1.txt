CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old right handed male with history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, Tegretol, Phenobarbital, Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel of EKG.  The patient is very drowsy, particularly in the early portions of the record.  He is intermittently confused.  He frequently reports seeing people, particularly people from his past.  He reports none of his typical complex partial seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In sleep, there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves.  In addition, in the sleep section of this part of the record, for which the patient had received generous doses of midazolam, there are sections with occipital sharp waves or subtle periodic complexes.
By 5:30 on the morning of the 2nd, the patient is awake.
Testing the patient during his confusional spells identifies a confused individual.  There are no epileptiform features associated with his clinical symptoms, just isolated left temporal sharp waves in sleep and what now appear to be somewhat poorly formed complexes in the occipital regions.
HR:   90 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This section of continuous video EEG monitoring is remarkable for a slow background, left temporal sharp waves, and what appear to be emerging, periodic occipital complexes.
