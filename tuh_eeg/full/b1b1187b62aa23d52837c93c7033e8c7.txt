History:	36 YR OLD MAN LH. PT STATES HE HAS NUMBNESS ON RIGHT SIDE OF HIS
BODY SINCE LABOR DAY. PT ALSO OVERDOSED 2 WEEKS PRIOR TO THAT.
ALL RECORDS ARE AT JEANES. HIS MOTHER SAYS HE HAS NO SHORT TERM
MEMORY. 56 CM HEAD NO H/O SZ.
Medications:	N/A
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No activation procedures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
