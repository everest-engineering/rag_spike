History:	31 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS AND
DIFFICULTY SPEAKING AND THREE EPISODES OF JERKY MOVEMENTS NOT
ASSOC WITH SZ ACTIVITY. R/O CVA, PT HAS NEG H/O OF SZ, ? TIA'S. PT IS
APPROX 7 WEEKS PREGNANT.
Medications:	Pre-natal vitamins
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  The EEG is almost entirely recorded while asleep.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
REM sleep is also seen.  Very short sleep latency and REM latency.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The short sleep latency and short REM latency
is suggestive of a sleep disturbance. A sleep evaluation may be beneficial if clinically indicated.
