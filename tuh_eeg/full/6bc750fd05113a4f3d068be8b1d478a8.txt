Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There are
intermittent burst (ratio 0.1-0.3) composed of symmetric high amplitude frontocentral maximal
generalized polyspikes and wave at 5-6hz. These burst mainly last 1-1.5 seconds.  However
infrequently they may last up to 10 seconds and appear to have a diffuse beta discharge in
between them. Some of them had an associated diffuse low amplitude body shaking seen on
video.  No posterior dominant rhythm is present.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  With noxious stimuli some diffuse
muscle artifact can be seen but there is no clear change in the background. The discharges with
stimulation appear to have a more consistent shaking correlate after stimulation.  Hr was 54
Summary of Findings:
Polyspike-and-wave complexes, frequent generalized, Mainly frontocentral
Burst-suppression pattern, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe background attenuation and bursts of generalized
polyspikes  These findings are indicative of a severe cerebral dysfunction and irritability. The
shaking correlate seen on video is consistent with cortical myoclonus.  Overall this findings in the
absence of sedatives or toxins is indicative of a very poor prognosis.
