History:	66 year old man for aortic arch aneurysm repair.
Medications:	Fentanyl, Isoflurane
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  With sedation the background becomes slower and more disorganized
with intermittent diffuse theta and delta as well as intermittent diffuse attenuation.  No clear
maintained asymmetry is seen during the study.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 40  INCISION: 8:54AM,
HEPARIN:  9:16AM--30,000UNITS, HEAD COOL:  9:43 TO 34 C, BURST SUPPRESSION: 9:53A
CIRCULATORY ARREST: NO CARDIAC ARREST: CROSS CLAMP 9:43, UNCLAMP 12:17P
HEAD WARM: 11:33, BODY WARM:, HEART  STARTED12:04
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful 4 hour EEG during aortic arch surgery. There was intermittent focal slowing in
the bilateral midtemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  All changes were communicated with the primary team.
