History:	75 YO MALE FOUND DOWN BY LANDLORD, . PT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN FOR 2
WKS. EMS REPORTS PT COVERED WITH ROACHES.
PMHX: HTN, GERD
Medications:	ALBUTEROL, LORAZEPAM, CIPRO, PROTONIX, IPRATROPIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
In limited wakefulness, the background is characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm that at best
reaches 7-8Hz, which is reactive to stimulation.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-
75uV, 6-7Hz activity, but at times there is frontal and central alpha activity.  During drowsiness, the
alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, bilateral
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and asleep due to diffuse background slowing.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
