CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24 -year-old with epilepsy, seizure free for the last 7 months.  Tends to have clusters of 5 to 6 seizures with dizziness, loss of consciousness, and tonic clonic activity.  Previous long-term EEG monitoring to evaluate these symptoms.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Abundant vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS were noted in stage II sleep.  Occasional snore arousals and movement were noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 55-60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third normal EEG for this adult.  Previous EEG monitoring did not find a clinical correlate for this patient's dizzy spells.  He does have a small degree of bradycardia noted today.
