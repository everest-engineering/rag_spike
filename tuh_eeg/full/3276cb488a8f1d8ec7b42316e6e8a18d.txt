CLINICAL HISTORY:   53 year old right handed woman who presented with worsening of expressive aphasia.  She has a history of lung cancer, currently receiving radiation and chemotherapy.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Heparin, Hydralazine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The waking background is symmetric, however.  When the patient becomes drowsy, an asymmetry is noted with left temporal focal theta and scant delta.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing may be correlated with the patient's imaging.  No sharp waves were noted.
