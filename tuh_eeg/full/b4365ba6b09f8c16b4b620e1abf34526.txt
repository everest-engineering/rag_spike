CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old man with history of hypertension presents after a crash with change in mental status and left-sided weakness found to have a thalamic basal ganglia hemorrhage with ventricular extension.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed in the chart.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system and anterior temporal electrodes with additional EKG electrodes.  The EEG was recording while the patient was obtunded.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with low amplitude at 2-4 Hz and 20-40 microvolts.  There is no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
