History: 75 YO FEMALE WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS. PMHX: HTN, DM, HPL, AFIB,
PVD. ETOH ABUSE. CT-HEAD SHOWED RIGHT POSTERIOR PARIETAL
HYPERDENSITY.
Medications: Fentanyl, Fluconazole, Nystatin, Hydrogen, Peroxide, Albuterol
Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators or moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. EEG is limited because of abundant EMG and movement artifact towards the end of the recording. Clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG.
