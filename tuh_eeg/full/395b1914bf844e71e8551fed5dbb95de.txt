CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma, episode of transient speech arrest on April 2, CNS metastases.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was alert.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized.  The alpha rhythm ranges from 6-9 Hz, averaging 8.5.  There is generous beta noted.  There are shifting asymmetries but there is a bit more disruption and faster frequency activity noted in the right central parental region in comparison to the left.   As the patient became drowsy, hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing was noted which a relatively symmetric in the central regions but a bit more prominent on the right more posterotemporally.  In this sharply contoured record, there are some right central sharps noted.  As the patient became drowsy, shifting slowing was noted with   occasional focal slowing in the left mid temporal region.  Bursts of shifting slowing in the left mid temporal region.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 72 BPM with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Superimposed at times somewhat subtle but definitive focal slowing in the right hemisphere particularly the central parietal regions.
Occasional arrhythmic slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slowing and disorganization in an otherwise awake and alert patient is concerning for a more diffuse rather than focal process.  There are some focal features in this record which are congruent with the localization with the patient's metastases.  Right central sharp waves raise a possibility for a focal mechanism for seizures and are congruent with the localization of 1 of her 2 metastases.
