History:	51 year old woman with chronic PEs, now undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy.
Medications:	Versed, Fentanyl, Lidocaine, rocuronium,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Patient is awake at the beginning of the recording with normal background (~12 Hz PDR and
normal AP gradient) observed.  Diffuse excess beta is present early in the recording.  Once general
anesthesia is administered, the background becomes a mixture of polymorphic frequencies.  Bypass
is initiated and cooling starts at ~ 9:53 AM.  No heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead at ~ 10
AM.  There is gradual progression to burst-suppression as hypothermia continues.  Total burst-
suppression is achieved by ~11:32 AM at 17.5 degrees Fahrenheit and the surgeon is notified.
Rewarming starts at ~ 1:03 PM.  QRS complexes are captured on the EKG lead at ~1:10 PM.
Repetitive symmetrical bursts of activity are captured by ~ 1:15 PM.  The background is continuous
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable nearly 7 hour continuous intraoperative EEG recording with ~ 4 hours of
direct remote EEG Attending supervision.
