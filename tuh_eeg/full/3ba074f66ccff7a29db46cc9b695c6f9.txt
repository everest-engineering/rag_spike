CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old woman with left facial head injury and loss of consciousness in June 2010 resulting in tinnitus, vertigo, orbital headaches, and transient global headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Flexeril, Fioricet, Antivert.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG is characterized for a disorganized background with predominant alpha. As the record continue, there is an improvement in the alpha rhythm, in addition to a generous beta rhythm. The record exhibits excess beta. As the patient goes into drowsiness, there is more rhythmic activity on the right side. The alpha on the left is disrupted. Hyperventilation activates the record, generating a rhythmic and rich activity in the right side, more organized in the right than in the left. Photic stimulation generates a bilateral driving response.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: This is a remarkable EEG for:
1. mildly disorganized for age with subtle asymmetry in the left side with disrupted alpha.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was recorded. Correlation with imaging is suggested.
