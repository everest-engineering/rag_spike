CLINICAL HISTORY:  82 year old with left arm weakness and transient episodes of left arm shaking, COPD, BPH, CAD, CNS metastasis.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, Dexamethasone, Insulin, Lovenox, Coreg., Singulair, Tamsulosin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is excess theta noted in the background.  There is a bit of shifting slowing in the occipital regions, right more so than the left.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing with occasional bursts of FIRDA.  On occasion, the alpha rhythm seems to be disrupted on the right compared to the left. Photic stimulation elicits a slight driving response, again, a little bit more remarkable on the left.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing and disorganization.
Focal features, including a slightly asymmetric alpha rhythm and occasional slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background disorganization is a nonspecific finding, supporting a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The asymmetry, alpha rhythm,
and the photic stimulation support a process on the right in this individual with seizures emanating from the left.
