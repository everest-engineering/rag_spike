CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with right hemiparesis, hypertension,
diabetes, stroke, aphasia. No other historical information available.

MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Lasix, Amiodarone, Hydralazine, Enoxaparin, Senna, Furosemide,
Metoprolol, Diovan, Spironolactone, Lantus, Lisinopril,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. There are problem with the T4 electrode in the initial sections of the record. In addition, head rocking artifact is noted in the T6 02 and there Is a suggestion of a salt bridge in the right occipital region.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Some section of the record demonstrates a 10 hertz
symmetric reactive alpha rhythm on the right, but the activity is uniformly slower on the left with slower posterior dominant rhythm, more rhythmic theta In the left hemisphere particular1y In the temporal regions. In the transition to drowsiness, delta activity is identified again slower on the left than the right. Despite significant artifacts including lateral rectus spike artifact, there are occasional simple, T3 sharp waves noted in the record with after going slow waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bilateral background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency
activity and some arrhythmic slowing.
3. Left femoral sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record supports a structural functional abnormality on the left
as might be seen following a stroke. This simple sharp waves suggest as localization related mechanism for epilepsy. Given the technical issues described above, a followup study In the lab is suggested.
