AGE: 114 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 10/12/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Asleep only EEG #: 15-1506
HISTORY:
114 y.o. Male with an acute right ACA/MCA infarct referred for routine EEG for altered mental status .
MEDICATIONS: ASA, ATORVASTATIN, ZOSYN, METOPROLOL, HEPARIN SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background continuous, asymmetric, and reactive . The left hemisphere consists of a fairly well organized mixture of alpha, theta, and delta, with fragments of an irregular posterior dominant rhythm approaching 8 Hz.
The right hemisphere consists of a less-well-organized mixture of alpha, theta, and delta, with attenuation of faster frequencies . A posterior dominant rhythm is less prominent over the right.
During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and further background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
There is mild generalized slowing is present.
There is continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
An irregular heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal Awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing
Suboptimal organization, worse on the right
Continuous right hemispheric polymorphic slowing
Right hemispheric attenuation of faster frequencies
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with right hemispheric cerebral dysfunction and cortical injury, likely
