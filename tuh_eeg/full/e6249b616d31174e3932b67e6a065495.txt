History:	67 year old man with a history of left frontal ICH.
Medications:	Keppra,  Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal PDR reaches 8 Hz.  The AP gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-
75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  Periods
of quiescence are captured, but no normal sleep architecture is present.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present over the left hemisphere and, especially,
over the left anterior- frontocentral region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left, left hemisphere, especially anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 23-minutes EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and continuous
moderate left hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the anterior quadrant and
frontocentral region. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
