CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old male with stroke, evaluated for post stroke aphasia.
MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol, nicardipine, phenytoin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively drowsy, but arousable during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage relatively diffuse theta pattern.  There is infrequent, lower voltage slow delta noted with isolated bursts noted in the left hemisphere, but these are relatively rare.
Heart rate 76 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse generalized theta.
Rare bursts of left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG is most compatible with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The subtle focal features described above are quite mild.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered.
