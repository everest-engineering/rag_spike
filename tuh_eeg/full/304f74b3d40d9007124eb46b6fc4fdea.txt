History:	56 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SZ. PT WITH ACUTE OR CHRONIC LEFT
OCCIPITAL CVA.   B/L CHRONIC INF. PT ALSO HAD HTN EMERG.  PMHX HIV,
Medications:	Propofol, stopped 1 HR before EEG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent independent focal sharp waves are present with phase
reversal and amplitude maximum at F3 more than F4.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral (L>R) frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the bilateral frontal
regions.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In
addition there is evidence of marked  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
