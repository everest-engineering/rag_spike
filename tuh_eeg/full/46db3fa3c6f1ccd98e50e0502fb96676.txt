CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old male with left basal ganglia hemorrhage with
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Gentamicin, Ancef, Ativan, Nicardipine, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standard
10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and
poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage and diffusely
slow with lower voltage, 1 to 2 Hz delta activity. Stimulation of the patient produces
artifact. There are bursts of low voltage, relatively symmetric, 0.75 to 1 Hz delta
HR: 78bpm.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a very slow, generalized delta pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are worrisome findings in the context of an acute
intracerebral hemorrhage. In addition, the absence of reactivity or variability are also
concerning findings.
