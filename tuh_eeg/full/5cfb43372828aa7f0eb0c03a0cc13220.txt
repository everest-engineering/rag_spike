Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity.
PDR is unstable.  The expected AP gradient is present.  Bursts of diffuse polymorphic theta and
delta activity are captured.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
