CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old female in for left carotid endarterectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Desflurane, Remifentanil, Lidocaine, Propofol, Vecuronium, Phenylephrine

REASON FOR STUDY:  Left CEA.

INTRODUCTION:  A continuous EEG was performed during left carotid endarterectomy using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded throughout the entire procedure, and the surgeon was reported any changes that could be seen.

The patient received heparin 17 minutes into the procedure and the carotid was clamped at 28 minutes into the procedure.  The common carotid was clamped at 28 minutes and 27 seconds into the procedure.  At that point any changes were reported.  The patient was unclamped at an hour and 5 minutes into the procedure.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background opens at the beginning of the record to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  No abnormal discharges are seen.  During the carotid endarterectomy, when the common carotid is clamped again at 2:45:04 p.m., the EEG was reviewed for the first 8 minutes personally by me, and there are no clear changes in the recording and to the background.  The patient was unclamped at 3:21:40 p.m.  Throughout the entire procedure, feedback was being given to the surgeon on any changes.

IMPRESSION:  Uneventful left carotid endarterectomy.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an uneventful left carotid endarterectomy.  No changes were seen to the background during clamping.
