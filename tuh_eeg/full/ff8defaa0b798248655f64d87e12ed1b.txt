CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed male with alcohol withdraw, status epilepticus 10 days ago.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of background beta and theta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall, the background is improved compared to the previous study. The excess beta and theta are nonspecific findings and can be due to this patient's medications.
