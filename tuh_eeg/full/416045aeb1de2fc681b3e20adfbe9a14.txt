HISTORY;  DAY TWO POST ANOXIC INSULT , FOLLOWING HYPOTHERMIA
MEDICATIONS:  Versed and Depakote.  Labetalol and Nipride were held.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient was intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial portions of the record, the patient is emerging from a hypothermia protocol.  The body temperature ranges from 34-36 degrees in the first few hours.
The initial pattern is a somewhat discontinuous pattern.  There are paroxysmal bursts of sharply contoured activity with sharply contoured theta delta but without a clear spike and wave pattern.  Asymmetry in the record is apparent with at times a bit more suppression on the right.  In addition, shifting asymmetries were noted.
As the patient's body temperature warms, the EEG becomes more continuous, this is noted at 10 a.m.
By 3 p.m. the EEG is more continuous with a mixture of theta and delta.  There are some triphasic waves and some sharply contoured morphologies but no definitive sharp waves and no seizures.
Over the course of the night the patient has increasing respiratory difficulty and the Versed drip is increased to 7 mg per hour.  This produces a lower voltage, slower EEG pattern.
No clinical seizures were recorded, and the patient's previously described myoclonus seems to be disappearing at the end of the EEG.
Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second day of video EEG monitoring for a patient who had anoxic insult and hypothermic protocol.  The EEG has transitioned to a lower voltage, slower and more featureless pattern.  The use of sedative hypnotic medications may play a role.  Additional clinical evaluation and correlation with imaging is essential.
