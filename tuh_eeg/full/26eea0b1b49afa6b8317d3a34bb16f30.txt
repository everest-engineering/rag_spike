History:	55 year-old woman with history of liver disease due to hepatitis C came in with
altered mental status.
Medications:	Ativan, Tramadol, Dilaudid
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG because of moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate-to-
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
