CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year old right handed man with new onset seizures.  As per the wife he was foaming at the mouth, eyes rolled back, had several episodes of staring for 1-2 minutes.  No recall of the events.  Follow up with recent discharge from.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Sleep is characterized in stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 intermittently throughout the recording.  These have a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 mV.  At one point at the onset of the recording they seem to become slightly monomorphic, but not clearly consistent with TIRDA.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
