CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed woman with history of cavernoma, epilepsy, fragile mental status, probably seizure free.  Recent whiplash injury, admitted to the hospital for stroke work up with dysarthria.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Gabapentin, HCTZ, Lovastatin, Lisinopril, Terbutaline
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, frontal central beta activity.  Occasional bursts of bilateral, arrhythmic delta activity, which may be brief or more sustained, were noted.  There was also some bursts which are a bit more prominent on the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, FIRDA was noted.  Stage II sleep includes spindles and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bursts of bilateral slowing.
Shifting slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to previous EEG made in 2011, which demonstrates a bit more bilateral, rhythmic or arrhythmic, delta often occurring in bursts.  This contrast to previous studies from 2005, 2004, and 2009 which demonstrated more
of a focal pattern on the left.  This may be part of a bihemispheric process which may be age related or related to the patient's underlying neurological issues.
