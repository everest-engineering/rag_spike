REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with multiple episodes of staring after resection of a right sphenoid wing meningioma.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and insulin.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some increased or diffuse frontocentral beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximally at T4 and at times at F4, continuously at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.

Seizures:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right temporal and central slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right hemisphere, maximal in the temporal and central regions which is consistent with the known surgery.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
