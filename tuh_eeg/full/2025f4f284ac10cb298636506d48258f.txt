CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed gentleman with a tonic clonic seizure
and incontinence. Past history of stroke and alcohol dependence.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was Performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes primarily a theta pattern with smaller amounts of beta. Hyperventilation and drowsiness all produce rhythmic 5-6 hertz activity. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The background slowing is a nonspecific pattern and can be seen as a postictal phenomenon or part of another diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
