History:	66 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ, PT STATES THAT HE HAS BEEN SZ
FREE FOR 18 YRS. LAST YR HE FELT THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE ONE BUT
DID NOT.
Medications:	GABAPENTIN, CYCLOBENZAPRINE (FLEXERIL)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background does not reveal a clear PDR. Very low voltage fast background.  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The absence of a PDR is likely related to his
low voltage background.
