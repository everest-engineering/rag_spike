CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old right handed woman with recurrent episodes of syncope versus seizure with visual scintillations.  May have shaking with events.  Events occur 4-5 times per year, none in recent months.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a routine 20-minute EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  It was a technically satisfactory study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 12 hertz, symmetric, reactive alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts.  Alpha squeak like amounts was noted.  Lambda was noted in wakefulness.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic frontocentral theta, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for eye blinking artifact and a driving response.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.  Clinical correlation, no focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Multiple normal variants such as lambda were noted in the record.
