REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of jerking.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old man with witnessed seizure and jerking, unresponsive in the ER, with multiple episodes given Ativan.  He has a history of diabetes, hypertension and noncompliance to medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Midazolam, metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while fully responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There were some F8 and T4 electrode artifacts.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture or activating procedures were not performed.  Overall, the background is consistent of delta slowing with intermixed beta seen diffusely in bursts.
SEIZURES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously with intermixed beta discharges diffusely throughout the recording.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  However, the presence of excess beta may suggest that the changes may be due at least in part medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
