CLINICAL HISTORY:  76 year old man with aortic stenosis and aortic root replacement, noted today to have left gaze and facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Left gaze and facial twitching.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed, but the patient was stimulated throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures are performed.  During the recording, the patient was stimulated and there appears to be a mild increase in muscle artifact but no real change in the frequencies.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There is this sharply contoured maximally frontal periodic discharge at 2 to 4 Hz, seen continuously throughout the recording, most consistent with generalized periodic epileptiform discharges, although at times they have a triphasic morphology.  It is difficult to state if these discharges are occurring in correlation with facial and shoulder twitching, although at times it does seem that there is a correlation.
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges, at times with an EEG correlate and diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction and irritability, which is seen in diffuse cortical processes like hypoxic events or severe metabolic dysfunction.  It is likely that the facial and arm twitching is related to the cortical discharges, which would be clinically consistent with myoclonus.
