CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old with epilepsy, seizure free, until a seizure several weeks ago with shaking headache.  In addition aura  of visual scintillations.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  This is a routine EEG with acceptable impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  The patient quickly transitions into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was deferred.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The patient appears to be quite sleepy.  Photic stimulation was not performed and if a generalized mechanism for epilepsy is important, a repeat study should be obtained.
