CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old woman with hepatitis C, hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis, past history of gunshot wound to the head with right hemiparesis, encephalopathy, and paroxysmal TIA-like symptoms with repetitive speech and right-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, lactulose, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically very challenging EEG for a patient who had difficulty cooperating.  There was a great deal of muscle and movement artifact in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG was diffusely slow and poorly organized with theta activity.  Although there was a great deal of muscle and movement artifact, there was arrhythmic delta activity noted in both hemispheres, and at times, left greater than right with some sharply contoured activity with phase reversal at T3 and P3.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by a decreased in muscle and movement artifact.  Shifting slowing was noted, with greater sharply contoured slowing noted in the left hemisphere.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  An extremely challenging bedside recording, but abnormal due to;
Marked background slowing.
Rhythmic slowing.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity with more arrhythmic delta noted in the left hemisphere compared to the right.
In this challenging record, there are sharp waves in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This individual with prior right occipital craniectomy and right frontal gliosis as well as bur holes in the right frontal region on the left parietal region, there are sharp waves.  These may be accentuated by the skull defect.  No triphasic waves were noted.  Overall, this EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  If additional information is needed, this study would need to be repeated when the patient can be more cooperative.
