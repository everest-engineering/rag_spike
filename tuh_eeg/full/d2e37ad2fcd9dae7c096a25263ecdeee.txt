History:	65 YR MALE WITH CC OF RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS FOUND TO HAVE LEFT MCA
INF.
Medications:	ASA, LOVENOX, TYLENOL, LISINOPRIL, ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Temporal Intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA) is present in the left anterior temporal region.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid and anterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of left anterior TIRDA and
intermittent focal slowing,  these findings are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region.
TIRDA has a high correlation with temporal lobe epilepsy.
