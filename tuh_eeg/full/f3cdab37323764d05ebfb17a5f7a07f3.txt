CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman with bilateral MCA territory strokes in the setting of ineffective endocarditis.  She currently has fluctuations in her mental status, concerning for subclinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include lorazepam, Protonix, gentamicin, ampicillin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8.5 to 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency subgradient that is weak.  Additional polymorphic theta activity is captured.  Frequent bilateral frontal/anterior temporal mixture of theta and delta activity are captured.  No abnormal sleep architecture is observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a regular heart rate with occasional premature QRS complexes.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Frequent moderate bilateral frontal/anterior temporal slowing.
No sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21 minute awake only EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and intermittent moderate bilateral frontal/anterior temporal slowing.  Mild diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology and in this patient is consistent with a history of recent bilateral MCA territory strokes.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate with occasional premature QRS complexes.
