CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old woman with refractory epilepsy status post right temporal lobe resection currently with medication reduction and repetitive seizures yesterday, subacute right subdural hematoma.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Topamax, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat disorganized pattern. In addition, there is prominent arrhythmic delta activity in the right temporal region with spread to the posterior temporal region and right frontocentral region. The left hemisphere includes primarily beta and theta frequency activity. Although there is a breech rhythm, there is little in the way of epileptiform activity but the epileptiform activity that appears, is seen right mid to posterior temporal and right central. As the patient becomes drowsy, FIRDA
is observed.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
3. Right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings today are in the region or at least adjacent to the region of her previous surgery. The background stowing and disorganization is an anticipated finding following status epilepticus with treatment with multiple sedative hypnotic medications. No seizures were recorded.
