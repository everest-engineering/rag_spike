ANOTHER IN ER  PMHX: SZS, CVA, SDH, HTN, DM, CAD STENT, ICMP, HLD,
ASTHMA, GERD.   CT. CHRONIC  LEFT MCA/PCA INFARCT
Medications:	INSULIN, DILANTIN, ADVAIR, COLACE, KEPPRA, ZOCOR, ATENOLOL,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There is asymmetry with continuous polymorphic delta activity with attenuation and
loss of faster frequencies on the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent focal spike-and-wave discharges and sharp waves are present in the left parasagittal
and temporal regions, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at C3/P3.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, intermittent, left hemispheric, C3/P3
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, with loss of faster frequencies
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm
which are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  As well as
continuous left hemispheric focal slowing and attenuation and lack of faster frequencies with
intermittent epileptiform discharges.  These findings are consistent with a history of stroke. The
presence of epileptiform discharges places this patient at a higher risk for seizures.
