ROOM NO:  MRICU.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 72-year-old male, who was admitted this morning with change in mental status, hepatitis C cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, and GI bleed.  Left arm drift with acute and chronic subdural hematoma and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine others
INTRODUCTION:  1 20 minute digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is a technically acceptable record.  The patient was initially quite somnolent, but was able to answer a few questions by the end.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with rhythmic mixed theta delta activity.  When the patient is responsive, eye movement artifacts and muscle are noted, but the EEG remains quite slow.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No significant focal or epileptiform features were noted in the record.  This EEG is supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function of many potential causes including toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
