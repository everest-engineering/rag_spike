CLINICAL HISTORY:  74 year old female with a history of gastric ulcers, COPD, and hypertension who presented with left-sided weakness and right frontal deep white matter infarct.  There was significant movement artifact throughout the recording.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Lisinopril, Acetaminophen.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  No activation procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  Activation procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves over T3 and T4, at times but the maximum appears to be more anterior and posterior over each hemisphere.
Right T4 continuous focal slow waves with loss of posterior dominant rhythm in addition to left T3 focal slowing almost continuously throughout the recording.
Generalized slowing seen at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves and sharp bursts over the right mid temporal and left mid temporal region.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability of the right and left hemisphere, maximum at the mid anterior temporal region, which has a high correlation with acute structural white matter lesions in those regions.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific, with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
