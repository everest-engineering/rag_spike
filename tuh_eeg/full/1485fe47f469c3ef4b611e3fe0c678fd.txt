LENGTH OF RECORDING:  26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures since the age of 16.  The patient is currently 8 months' pregnant.
MEDICATIONS:  Include Lamictal and prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system of with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed, since the patient is 8 months' pregnant.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 11.5-12 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies of low amplitude anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex wave and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent frequently arrhythmic beta activity is captured over the left posterior quadrant.  Additionally, intermittent low to moderate amplitude sharp waves with after-going slow waves are observed over the left posterior quadrant, with phase reversal over T5, O1, P3, C3 electrodes.  Frequency of these discharges increases during sleep.  At times, they are imbedded within the rhythmic alpha range monomorphic activity.  On a single occasion, at approximately 3:01:50 p.m., a rhythmic burst in alpha range is noted over the left anterior temporal/frontal region.
FINDINGS:
Frequent left posterior quadrant/occipital sharp waves with after-going slow waves.
Intermittent mild, at times rhythmic, focal left posterior quadrant slowing.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal awake and asleep 26-minute EEG due to intermittent left posterior quadrant sharp waves with after-going slow waves as well as left posterior quadrant mild focal slowing that at times is rhythmic.  These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and is suggestive of focal mechanism of seizures.
