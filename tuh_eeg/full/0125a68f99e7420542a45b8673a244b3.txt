REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old man with history for 7 years, has been seizure free of 2 years, then seizures became more frequent.  The patient feels it related to stress.  Here for follow up.
MEDICATIONS:  Valtrex, ritonavir, Reyataz, Epzicom, metoclopramide, levetiracetam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.
Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate:  72.
Abnormal discharges:  Bursts of generalized spike and waves seen symmetrical with a frontal predominance at a frequency of 4.5 to 5 Hz lasting for 0.5 second to a second with one burst having some polyspikes.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to symmetric generalized spike and waves at 4.5 to 5 Hz.
CLINICAL COURSE:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  No seizures were seen during this recording.
