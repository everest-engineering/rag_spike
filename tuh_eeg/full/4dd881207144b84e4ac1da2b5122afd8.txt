CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed woman with family history of epilepsy, seizures recognized when she was pregnant about 7 years ago.  With sleep deprivation she had myoclonus or auras of a "funny feeling".
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 10.7 Hz 50 mV alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing bursts of higher amplitude paroxysmal slowing.  Within these bursts, there is a definitive pair of 4 Hz spike and slow wave complexes from the right central region.  There are also some suspicious underlying frontal predominant or midline spike and wave bursts noted in hyperventilation, but the one that is really well defined is on the right, not a generalized pattern. Features of sleep include vertex waves and spindles. Photic stimulation is performed after the patient has been sleeping and does elicit a driving response.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
The appearance of a pair of 4 Hz spike and wave complexes from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is suspicious underlying generalized discharges noted at the end of hyperventilation and in the transition to sleep as well.  This EEG may be correlated with previous childhood or young adult EEGs which were more supportive of a generalized, inherited mechanism for epilepsy.
