CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed male with complex partial epilepsy, nocturnal seizures, last seizure 2 weeks ago. One to 2 seizures per month.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, generous rhythmic theta. Occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves are observed in relaxed wakefulness and hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing followed by Vertex waves. POSTS are noted in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation serves as both an alerting response and also elicits bilateral driving. With the use of specific temporal lobe montages, more subtle left anterior temporal sharp waves can be identified in relaxed wakefulness and into stage II sleep.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Epileptiform activity seen most prominently In hyperventilation from the left temporal region.
2. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The background slowing is a nonspecific pattern, not as prominent in later sections of the record, and may be due to medication effect. This appears to have been a sleep-deprived EEG which may also have contributed to the theta that was more prominent earlier in the record.
