CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with an oropharyngeal tumor.  The patient has an episode of blank staring, no responsive, followed by generalized shaking.  History of DVT, IVC filter, alcohol abuse, frequent falling.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall background includes generous beta and theta.  The patient is transitioning in and out of sleep.  In the sharply contoured record, there are discreet left temporal sharp waves after slow waves.
The patient was awakened for photic stimulation.  There is a bit more alpha frequency activity noted when she is awakened for photic but the tech is unable to keep the patient awake.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an unusual but abnormal EEG due to:
Patient hypersomnolence.
Some degree of background slowing and disorganization despite the hypersomnolence.
In maximal awareness and intermittently in drowsiness, left focal slowing.
Two left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a partial mechanism for seizures.  Additional clinical evaluation may be important to determine why this patient is so hypersomnolent.
