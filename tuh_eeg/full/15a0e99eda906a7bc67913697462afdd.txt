CLINICAL HISTORY:   60 year old male with multiple infarcts, now admitted over the weekend with change in mental status, difficulty walking, and aggressive behavior.  Past history of stroke with right hemiparesis but previously ambulatory.  The patient had been incontinent and confused.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, Zocor, Insulin, ASA, Lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has limited communication skills.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized for an adult of this age.  There is an identifiable alpha rhythm of 7 to 8 Hz which sometimes can be identified bilaterally.  There are intermittent bursts of frontally predominant slowing with shifting slowing left or right.  Features of drowsiness include bursts of shifting, slowing, or FIRDA.  Brief epochs of sleep are noted followed by arousal.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A small amount of background slowing and disorganization.
Frontally predominant rhythmic delta.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a large chronic left middle cerebral artery infarct, there is less in the way of focal features than one would expect.  In addition, there are some bilateral features noted.
