CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old male who had an episode of shortness of breath, diaphoresis, then slid down on the floor into a fetal position, had an episode of apnea, turned blue and was unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, Xanax, Abilify.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  Posts were noted in sleep.  The patient transitions in and out of light sleep with scant stage II sleep.
Heart rate 50-60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EKG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta may be associated with the use of benzodiazepines.
