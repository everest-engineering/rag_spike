CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with chronic static encephalopathy, epilepsy, now seizure free for nearly 2 years, developmental delay, and behavioral issues, cervical DJD.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Phenobarbital
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with more a rhythmic theta frequency pattern and alpha rhythm of approximately 7 Hz.  Tiny discreet left frontal sharp waves are noted.  Overall these are seen in wakefulness, are rare in frequency, and on 1 or 2 occasions have a bilateral representation. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in frontal beta.  Scant photic driving is noted.
HR:    50 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
Rare discreet frontal sharp waves primarily from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing has been previously described.  This is the patient's third EEG and the subtle, left frontal sharp waves have been noted in all of them, supportive of a focal mechanism for epilepsy.
