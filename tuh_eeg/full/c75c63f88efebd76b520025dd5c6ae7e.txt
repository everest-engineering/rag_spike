History:	45 year old woman who presented with multiple episodes of loss of consciousness.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low-to-moderate amplitude slow and fast alpha variant
that attenuates with eye eye opening.  Expected AP gradient is present.  Diffuse excess beta
activity is present.  Additionally, brief bursts of diffuse frontally predominant delta activity are
captured during wakefulness early in the recording.  During sleep, the posterior dominant rhythm
attenuates, EMG artifact disappears, voltage attenuates diffusely and symmetrical K-complexes are
seen.  Patient falls asleep rapidly.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Occasional  50-75uV, 100 msec positive
sharp transients occur bilaterally over the occipital regions of the head during saccadic eye
movements with the eyes open.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm during
wakefulness and <60 bpm during sleep.
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), occasional, early in the recording
Beta, excessive
Alpha rhythm, slow
Alpha variant, fast
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to presence of FIRDA early in the
recording. FIRDA is a seen in non-specific encephalopathy, increased ICP and bilateral deep white
matter lesions.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
