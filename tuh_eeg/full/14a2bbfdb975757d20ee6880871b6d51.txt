CLINICAL HISTORY: Seizures
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, phenobarbital, Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal background.  The activity from both hemispheres includes slow delta.  Epileptiform activity was noted, particularly in the left posterior quadrant including T3, T5, and O1.  The epileptiform activity includes a burst of faster frequency activity and an underlying spike.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produces prominent frontal delta.
The epileptiform activity occurs in bursts.
It is essentially a continuous occipital spike with subtle build-up but seems to ameliorate with stimulation.
The patient received doses of phenobarbital.  With the phenobarbital, the EEG seems to be improving in to more of a pattern of high amplitude spikes but with less in the way of frequency evolution.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
