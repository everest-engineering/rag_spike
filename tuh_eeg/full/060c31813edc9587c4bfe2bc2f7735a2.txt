STUDY DATE:  02/11/2013 to 02/12/2013 for a total of 16 hours.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure-detection software in addition to patient alarms and nurse's notes were used to review the EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Topamax, Vimpat

HISTORY:  She is a 33-year-old woman with history of seizures for 3 years and majority of them during sleep lasting 1-2 minutes with generalized shaking.  She is here for differential and classification.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 sleep.

During the recording, there is intermittent sharply contoured central theta during wakefulness that appears to have a slight asymmetric towards the right and is not clearly pathologic.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  C4/P4 Focal slow waves at 2-4 Hz.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right centro parietal focal slowing.

Clinical Correlation:
This EEG reveals evidenced right centro parietal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  This is day 1 of dictation of 16 hours.
