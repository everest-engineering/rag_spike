History:	51 year old woman with a history of a possible nocturnal convulsion in 2014. Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Awake & asleep
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. A single right midtemporal sharp transient is captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp transients, one, right temporal, mid Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 27-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. The single sharply contoured waveform in the right midtemporal region is of unclear clinical significance.
