CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old right handed female with history of PCOS, grand mal seizures that started at age 18, now with seizures described as shaking and stiffening with incontinence and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol, Topamax.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at D5, D3 intermittently at 2-4 Hz and amplitude at 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left parietal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal serial dysfunction in the left parietal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
