History:	61 year old woman with a history of chronic and, now, acute, strokes. Her mental
status remains poor and her neurological exam fluctuates.
Medications:	ASA, no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists primarily of polymorphic diffuse
theta activity, occasional polymorphic alpha activity and bursts of diffuse frontally predominant
delta activity (FIRDA).  Drowsiness is characterized by increase in the amount of polymorphic delta
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Patient moves a lot throughout the
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Artifact, movement
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No stage 2 sleep
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  FIRDA is could be seen in encephalopathy, increased ICP, bilateral deep white matter
lesions.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
