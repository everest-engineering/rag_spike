History:	77 year old found down with multiple fractures.  He also had asystole, requiring 3
rounds of CPR.  He currently has intermittent twitching.
Medications:	PROPOFOL, FENTANYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
Due to fractures and bleeding, impedances are high in some of the leads, some leads are
displaced and there is continuous artifact in O1 and O2 leads.  There is no PDR and no AP
gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity admixed
with periods of discontinuous.  More pronounced, at times sharply contoured, delta activity is seen
over the left frontal region.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No electrographic seizures are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EEG is reactive.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates an irregular heart rate up to 120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontal, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 23 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and continuous moderate-
to-severe left frontal focal slowing. These findings are indicative of a moderate-to- severe diffuse
encephalopathy.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the left frontal
region.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate up to 120 bpm.  No electrographic
seizures are present.  EEG is limited because of electrode artifact due to high impedances,
electrode placement and blood.  If clinically indicated, suggest a repeat EEG.
