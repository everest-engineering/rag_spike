History:	32 YR MALE WITH EPISODES OF WAKING UP WITH RUE PAIN/ FEELING LIKE
BEING ELECTROCUTED. THEN WITH NUMBNESS AND TINGLING EVERY AM IN
THAT ARM WITH SEVERE PAIN.  X3 MONTHS.  MOM WITH SZS.  PMHX:
DEPRESSION/ANXIETY/ SCHIZOPHRENIA.  PT WAS USING ROGAINE X 3MNTH
Medications:	PROZAC, FLEXERIL, ATARAX, GABAPENTIN. ( PT STOPPED ROGAINE 1 WK
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces intermittent
high amplitude diffuse polymorphic delta.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 80
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
