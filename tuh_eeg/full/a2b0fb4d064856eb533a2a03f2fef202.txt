58 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O 2 TYPES OF ? SZ, ONSET 1988. 1ST VERTIGO MOSTLY  A FEELING OF SPINNING TO THE LEFT LASTING SEC, FOLLOWED BY PRESSURE/SOUND OF MUFFLED AND DIZZINESS LASTING 10-20 MIN. FOLLOWED BY HA 2ND WITHOUT VERTIGO,  HA, PRESSURE.  1-2
No AED
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. At times during drowsiness there is a fronto central alpha only seen on the left hemisphere.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep
