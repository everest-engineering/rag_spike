History: Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
44 year old woman who presents with recurrent seizures. Propofol and Keppra
Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside_video-EEG  monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for -8 hours from 5/3/2015 till 5/4/2015.  Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.  All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient. The background consists primarily of diffuse spindle-frequency moderate amplitude waveforms admixed with bursts of polymorphic theta-delta activity and occasional periods of discontinuity. By the end of the recording, during periods of arousals, additional non-evolving moderate amplitude monomorphic diffuse frontally predominant sharply contoured 6-7 Hz theta activity appears.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate, mostly sedated record No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous 8hour video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Based on the patterns seen, this degree of the background slowing is at least partially related to the medication effect. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present. These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
