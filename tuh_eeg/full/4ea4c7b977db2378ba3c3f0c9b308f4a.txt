CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman admitted on the 24th with new onset slurred speech, right facial twitching for 3 days.  HIV disease, hypertension, and gastric bypass.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient had involuntary twitching of the face and leg.  A muscle monitor was placed on chin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  It is a pattern of background slowing with at times an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  This background is disrupted by both generalized, frontally predominant paroxysmal slowing as well as some shifting arrhythmic delta, some of which is maximum on the left.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the bursts of frontally predominant paroxysmal higher amplitude delta.  Quiet relaxation results in a better organized pattern.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
The patient's video and the twitch monitor demonstrates a twitch artifact, but no scalp EEG correlate.
Heart rate 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are nonspecific, but are more characteristic of a metabolic encephalopathy.  No definitive epileptiform features were observed.  If seizures are thought to be an important consideration, a more prolonged tracing can be considered, but the overall pattern described above is more compatible with a metabolic process.
