REASON FOR STUDY:  History of stroke.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old man with history of prior stroke and traumatic brain injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Alprazolam, Humulin, metformin, isosorbide, metoprolol, clonidine, levetiracetam, losartan, furosemide, nifedipine, fluoxetine, Trazodone, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedure included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is frontocentral beta better seen over the right hemisphere and slightly attenuated over the right hemisphere over the central parietal regions.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II only.  Please note that some of the vertex waves are seen isometrically better over the right hemisphere over the right central region.
Heart rate is 48.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  Please note that the asymmetry seen over the right hemisphere is likely related to the known arachnoid cyst.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
