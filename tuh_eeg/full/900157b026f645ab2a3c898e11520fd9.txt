CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with new onset seizures last week.  The patient reported feeling dizzy, loss of consciousness, shaking with mouth twisting to the left, and tongue biting.  Seizure lasted 3 seconds with a 30-second seizure.  No identifiable epilepsy risk factors.

MEDICATIONS:  None reported.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a routine, 22 minute EEG was impedances generally under 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by hypnagogic hyper secretory with an increase in amplitude of the background and an increase in theta.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude and slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.

Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.

Heart rate 84 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform activity was noted in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration for this adult, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
