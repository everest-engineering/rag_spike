CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, hepatitis C, and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, Aricept, Synthroid, lisinopril, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 36-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent, but arouses to tactile stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  When the patient is resting quietly, the background EEG is markedly slow, featureless, lacking the more normal adult morphologies of an awake individual.  Frontally predominant triphasic waves were noted.  In addition, there are isolated sharp waves noted in the record with variable phase reversals including left frontal central, occasional right frontal and even occipital.  Spontaneous arousals are associated with an increase in theta frequency activity.  Spontaneous arousals and arousal to stimulation are both associated with amelioration of the frontally predominant triphasic waves.  In some cases, spontaneous arousal by the patient is associated with asterixis as the patient moves about.
Following stimulation, the patient drifts off into a drowsy state and the triphasic waves returned.
Heart rate 120 bpm.  Occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due:
Marked background slowing.
Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy, such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  The triphasic waves are characteristics of this.  There are also isolated sharp waves, which are not triphasic waves suggesting a potential for seizures.  In this individual with advanced dementia, clinical correlation is suggested.
