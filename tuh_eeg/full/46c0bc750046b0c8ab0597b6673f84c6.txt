CLINICAL HISTORY: A 27-year-old male with juvenile epilepsy, since the age of 3, seizure free since 12, but now suffering migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is a technically acceptable 20 minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there was a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Brief drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling of the eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produced a small amount of theta.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving. Heart rate: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Individuals with childhood epilepsy, may not necessarily demonstrate sharp waves or spikes in adulthood. Migraine headache does not typically have an EEG signature.
