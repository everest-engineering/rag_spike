History:	82 YO FEMALE P/W ISOLATED APHASIA FOR 2.5 HOURS. STROKE ALERT.
PMH: HTN, HLD, DEPRESSION, LEG EDEMA, GOUT.
EEG TO R/O SZ.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The awake background consists mostly of alpha-range
frequencies, which have fair organization.  During drowsiness, there is attenuation of the posterior
dominant rhythm, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely. Sleep transients are not captured during
There is occasional left fronto-temporal polymorphic delta slowing, at times sharply contoured.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 78 bpm and irregular on a single
EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous generalized
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left frontotemporal
Other, Note is made of an irregular heart rate on a single EKG lead.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1. Suboptimal organization  2.
Occasional left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left fronto-temporal cerebral dysfunction superimposed on
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Note is made of an irregular heart rhythm on a single EKG lead.
