History:	71 YO MALE WITH A PMH OF HCC AND CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS CAME TO
TUH FOR LIVER TRANSPLANT ON 2/14/2015. ON SATURDAY PT WAS TAKEN
OFF ALL SEDATION. PT STILL NOT WAKING UP AND UNRESPONSIVE TO PAIN.
Medications:	INSULIN, NYSTATIN, HYDROMORPHINE, ASA, PROTONIX, METOPROLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some intermittent improvement with slightly faster frequencies more in the theta
range.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
