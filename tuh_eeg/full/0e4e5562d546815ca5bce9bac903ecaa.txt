CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, severe obstructive sleep apnea and restrictive lung disease presented with PEA code and now responsive with normal eye movement.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, Zosyn, ASA, Lipitor, Plavix.  Fentanyl recently stopped.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was comatose on exam.  No activating procedure were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG at 4-6 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times, there is intermittent diffuse attenuation of the EEG.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There is intermittent generalized periodic discharges, which are seen maximally centrally at times sharply contoured and others with triphasic morphology.  Between them there are bursts of diffuse attenuation that may last up to 1 second.
Generalized slow waves.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized periodic discharges.
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with evidence of diffuse cerebral and cortical dysfunction, which is consistent with the known hypoxic injury.  No seizures were seen.
