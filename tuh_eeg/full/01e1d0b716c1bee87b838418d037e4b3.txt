Continuous bedside EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 55 hours from 02:07 AM on 03/14/2014 to
03/17/2014.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw
EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes
in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation of any activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  The later hours of the record the EEG becomes completely attenuated.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  During the first hours some intermittent frontal predominant spike and
polyspike and wave. That later become more attenuated and almost disappear. The appear to
become intermittent focal central slow waves and later disappear.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 76
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 55 hours video-EEG because of diffuse background attenuation and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
