CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 79-year-old woman with a loss of consciousness while teaching, found to have intracerebral hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is very low voltage.  In addition, there is a fair amount of ICU artifact and muscle artifact.  Extraocular movements are slightly asymmetric, raising concerns that electrode placement might be suboptimal.
The overall EEG is very low voltage with an awake individual with generous frontocentral beta, asymmetric eye movements, what may represent central mu-activity, and a suggestion of a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude at the background.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with some bursts of frontal delta.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
This is a very low voltage, and technically somewhat challenging EEG, but it is remarkable.
No significant focal features.
No epileptiform features.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  If seizures are an important consideration for this individual, a followup study may be of value.
