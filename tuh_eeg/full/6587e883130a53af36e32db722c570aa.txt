AGE: 78 y.o.
SEX: female
START DATE OF STUDY: 09/23/2015 at 16:48 END DATE OF STUDY: 9/25/2015 at 15:14 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: LTM, coma study EEG #: 15-261
HISTORY:
a 78 y.o. Female with small bowel obstruction , sepsis, rapid atrial fibrillation, and worsening hypotension referred for LTM for altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS: norepinephrine, dopamine, phenylephrine, pipercillin-tazobactam
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as well as extensive random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed.
DAY 1 (9/23/2015, 16:48 - 9/24/2015, 08:00) BACKGROUND:
The background is symmetric and continuous and consists of
diffuse delta without admixed faster frequencies.
There is no clear reactivity, state change, or variability. PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) : None.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Rare (<1 hour) left hemispheric sharp waves, broadly distributed
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or Detected.
OTHER: Note is made of an irregular heart rate in a single EKG lead.
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal long term video EEG due to:
Severe generalized slowing
Background disorganization
Rare left hemispheric sharp waves, broadly distributed
Note is made of an irregular heart rate in a single EKG lead.
These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction with left hemispheric epileptogenic potentials . There are no clinical or electrographic seizures reported or detected. Note is made of an irregular heart rate in a single EKG lead.
DAY 2 (9/24/2015 08:00 to 9/25/2015 08:00) BACKGROUND: none
GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change FOCAL SLOWING: none
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Rare left hemispheric sharp waves, broadly distributed
Rare independent right hemispheric sharp waves, broadly distributed
As the day progresses, there is development of occasional diffuse sharp waves. During periods of arousal, these become periodic at 1.5-2 Hz, without evolution, for periods of 5 min to 45 min (stimulus-induced rhythmic periodic discharges or
SIRPIDs) .
OTHER: Note is made of an irregular heart rate in a single EKG lead.
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Same as day 1, with the addition of:
Rare right hemispheric sharp waves (independent of left temporal sharp waves), broadly distributed
Development of occasional diffuse sharp waves . During periods of arousal, these become periodic at 1.5-2 Hz, without evolution, for periods of 5 min to 45 min (stimulus-induced rhythmic
periodic discharges or SIRPIDs).
There are no definite electrographic seizures.
DAY 3 (9/25/2015, 08:00 - 9/25/2015, 15:14)
BACKGROUND: background is slightly less attenuated
GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change
FOCAL SLOWING: no change
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) : none
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: no change from Day 2 OTHER: heart rate less irregular on this day
DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Slight improvement in degree of background slowing
FINAL IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Severe generalized background slowing, with slight improvement on day 3
Background disorganization
Rare left hemispheric sharp waves, broadly distributed, seen on days 1 and
Rare independent right hemispheric sharp waves, broadly distributed, seen on day 2
Development of occasional diffuse sharp waves, which become periodic during periods of arousal on days 2-3 (stimulus-induced rhythmic periodic discharges or SIRPIDs) .
Irregular heart rate in a single EKG lead
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, with slight improvement by day 3 of the study. There are rare epileptiform potentials seen independently over both hemispheres; these are not seen on day 3.	During days 2-3, the background became reactive, with stimulus-induced rhythmic periodic discharges at 1.5-2 Hz; these discharges did not definitely evolve into electrographic seizures but do signify cortical hyperexcitability.
