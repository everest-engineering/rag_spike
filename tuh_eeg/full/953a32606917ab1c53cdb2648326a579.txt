History:	55 year old man with myoclonic jerks noted after days of change in mental status.
Medications:	Versed/ Turned off at 8:30AM today
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of attenuated diffuse delta activity
admixed with diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms.  Continuous EKG artifact is noted.
Two separate head jerks to the left are noted (at 9 min 24 sec and 24 min 10 sec into the
recording). These are only associated with EMG artifact.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Other, reactive
Other, 2 head jerks to the left
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 25-minute EEG due to severe background slowing and attenuation. This
finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Two
separate head jerks to the left are only associated with EMG artifact.
