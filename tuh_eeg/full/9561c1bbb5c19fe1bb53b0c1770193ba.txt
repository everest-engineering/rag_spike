AGE: 50 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/30/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : ICU
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, asleep only EEG #: 15-1744
HISTORY:
50 y.o. male with a history of ESRD, HIV, HTN, CAD, with altered mental status and gram positive cocci in CSF, referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.
MEDICATIONS : INSULIN, HYDRALAZINE, KAYEXALATE, SORBITOL, AMPICILLIN , CEFEPIME, VANCOMYCIN, ACYCLOVIR, MIDAZOLAM, ATORVASTATIN , HEPARIN, DEXAMETHASONE, FAMOTIDINE
SEDATION : propofol drip on hold as of 11/30/2015 15:49; midazolam as per above med list
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the, International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The record consists predominantly of a burst suppression pattern . Bursts consist of 1-3 seconds of disorganized alpha and theta.
Periods of suppression last 4-7 seconds.
Occasionally the record becomes discontinuous, with disorganized medium to low amplitude theta, alpha, and delta.
There is no clear reactivity, state change or variability to noxious stimulation.
There is severe generalized slowing. There is no focal slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
1. There is a single sharp-and-slow wave over the right temporal region (T2 max) .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:
Severe diffuse slowing, with burst suppression pattern and lack of reactivity
A single sharp-and-slow wave over the right temporal region (T2 max) .
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. These findings may in part be due to a medication effect, especially in the setting of renal dysfunction .
A single sharp-and-slow wave over the right temporal region (T2 max) is of unclear significance.
