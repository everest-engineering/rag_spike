History:	42 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NEW ONSET SZ X 3 WEEKS AGO WHEN
STARTED ON TRAMADOL QUESTION OF SIDE EFFECT, PT REPORTS 3 SZ
WITH LOC AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION.
Medications:	VANCOMYCIN, ZOSYN, DECADRON, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
complexes appear.  During drowsiness, there are small sharp spikes seen also known as benign
epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS) in the bilateral anterior temporal region.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
84. Some PAC's
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
BETS (benign epileptiform transients of sleep) or SSS (small sharp spikes)
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  BETS are a benign variant with no
clear clinical significance.
