HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with migraine headache admitted with syncope versus seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Norvasc
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 microvolts
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Sleep is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with rare vertex waves and K-complexes. Photic stimulation serves to awaken the patient, but does not elicit a driving response.

HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this
EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study is suggested.
