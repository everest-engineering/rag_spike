CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed male with metastatic lung cancer, right frontal mets, status post craniotomy 1 year ago with subsequent development of seizures.  The patient admitted to hospital with recurrent seizure.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Insulin, Keppra, Percocet, Xanax, Amaryl, Glimepiride, Lovenox,

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Prominent central beta was noted at C4 and CZ.  The overall background includes generous beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, the beta activity in the right central region is a bit more prominent and there is subtle, underlying slowing in the right frontocentral region. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR:    108 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle, focal slowing in the right central region.
2. Focal beta activity at C4.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal beta activity may reflect an underlying breach rhythm.  The focal slowing is congruent with this patient's previous neurosurgical
history.  No epileptiform features were identified.
