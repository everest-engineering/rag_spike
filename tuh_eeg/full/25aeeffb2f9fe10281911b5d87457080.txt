CLINICAL HISTORY:  86 year old right handed man with history of hypertension, pacemaker, atrophy, severe small vessel disease, presented with an episode of syncope and loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status and syncope.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal electrode.  The patient was recorded mainly in sleep with some wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz.  It appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The majority of the recording is during sleep.  There is stage I and stage II architecture seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  There is also diffuse attenuation of all electrodes.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
