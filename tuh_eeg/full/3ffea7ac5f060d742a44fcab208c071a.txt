CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old male with increasing frequency of visual spells where he feels like he is losing his visual perception and becoming blind, history of sarcoid and posterior retinal detachment.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, and Solu-Medrol,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an unusual pattern.  There is a slow alpha rhythm of approximately 6 hertz.  Intermittently, in the occipital region, there is fast activity of 14 hertz.  There appears to be a subtle asymmetry with a bit more vigorous 14 hertz activity in the left occipital region relative to the right and some subtle underlying occipital slowing noted on the right.  The patient is quite drowsy, transitioning from wakefulness to sleep.  In sleep, there are some POSTS noted, right more so than the left.
Photic stimulation was performed when the patient was drifting off to sleep, and no driving response was noted.
HEART RATE 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult due to:
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
An unusual pattern with beta activity noted in the occipital regions which seems to be asymmetric more so on the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  No definitive epileptiform features were noted, but some of the findings noted today may be similar to previous occipital findings for this individual.
