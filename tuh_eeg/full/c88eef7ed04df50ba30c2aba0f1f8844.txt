CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male with new onset seizures, following
right sided stroke in December, 2008, seizure free since April, 2009, but two seizures
with postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively
low-voltage, for an adult of this age, but quite well organized, with generous beta and a
glimpse of an alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta activity
as well as a small amount of delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
Beta spindles are observed in stage 2 sleep.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features are observed. Normal. EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
