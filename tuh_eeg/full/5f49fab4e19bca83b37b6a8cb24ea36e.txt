CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old right handed man with history of hypertension, CAD, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and CABG who presents for aortic root replacement surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Isoflurane, Fentanyl, Versed
REASON FOR STUDY:  EEG monitoring during aortic replacement.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system and additional single lead EKG electrode during the entire operation of aortic root replacement.  The EEG was monitored for changes during the procedure and notification of burst suppression and attenuation, as well as wave forms were given to the surgeon during the recording.  The patient was intubated and sedated during the procedure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During the beginning of the recording the patient appears to have a background consisting of well formed posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz with normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded mainly during wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed at this point.  No abnormal discharges were seen during the baseline. During the recording the patient was cooled and appeared to reach burst suppression at 10:30 in the morning and complete suppression was achieved at 11:45 a.m.  The procedure continued and the surgeon was reported about these 2 changes.  By 12:26 p.m. the EEG again regained a burst suppression pattern from suppression.  This was informed again to the surgeon and this burst suppression pattern continued to improve and became more continuous until the end of the recording in which the recording was concluded and reached back to baseline with a slight slowing.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Uneventful EEG recording during aortic arch repair.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an uneventful recording during aortic arch repair.  All changes were reported to the surgeon.
