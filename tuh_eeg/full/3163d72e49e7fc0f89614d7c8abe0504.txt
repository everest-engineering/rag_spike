LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old man with a history of several years of episodes that occur in the setting of increased stress.  In the last several months, the frequency of these episodes has increased dramatically, in the setting of the loss of his brother.  Episodes are characterized by a sensation of dizziness and neck numbness followed by a fall and generalized shaking lasting several minutes with subsequent decreased responsiveness and postictal period.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 to 10-1/2 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and voltage is decreased diffusely.  Hyperventilation results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead, with the exception of mild increase in the heart rate during hyperventilation.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
