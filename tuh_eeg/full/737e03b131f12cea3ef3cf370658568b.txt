History:	59 YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH SUBDURAL HEMATOMA AND PARTIAL COMPLEX
SEIZURES.

DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The waking background is characterized by an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Background activity
was characterized by diffuse theta activity with some anterior to posterior gradient.  No sleep was
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal (F7-F3) region with associated
loss of faster frequencies.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right centro-
temporal (C4/T4) region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 54
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left frontotemporal, with associated attenuation
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left frontal region with loss
of faster frequencies, which is consistent with the history of subdural hematoma. In addition there is
right centro-temporal focal slowing, which is consistent with a  focal structural cerebral dysfunction
in that region. Lastly the mild diffuse slowing is suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which  is etiologically nonspecific.
