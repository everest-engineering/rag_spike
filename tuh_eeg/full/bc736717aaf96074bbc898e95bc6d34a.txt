CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old gentleman with a history of hypercoagulable state, multiple DVT, PE, IVC filter, and severe right heart dysfunction.  OR monitoring for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy and removal of right atrial clots.

MEDICATIONS:  Versed, fentanyl, vecuronium, , propofol, isoflurane, and epinephrine.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was initiated at 9:11 in the morning after the patient had received anesthesia.  Recording continued through therapeutic hypothermia, bypass and then rewarming.  The physician was on standby for 1 hour prior to the initial EEG and total 4 hours of 1 on 1 remote review of physician monitoring time was utilized. Total recording time 6 hours 40 minutes

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the 1st several hours of recording, the EEG demonstrates a relatively symmetric, anesthetic pattern with intermittent Bovie artifact.  By 10:30 a.m., the EEG is lower voltage and slower.  The EEG is increasingly suppressed between 11 a.m. and noon.  As the record reaches suppression, there is very slow, periodic complexes noted.  The EEG is essentially suppressed at 11:55 at cross clamp with these very slow periodic complexes.

Circulatory arrest is initiated at 11:59 and consistently flat at 12:09.  The rewarming process begins at 1:53.  The patient is taken off bypass at 12:40, and the EEG gradually returns to a continuous pattern in the remaining hours of recording.  As it does, it is initially a discontinuous pattern and subtly more continuous pattern by 3:25 p.m.

IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring during this pulmonary thromboendarterectomy with hypothermia was remarkable for:
1. Achievement of a suppressed pattern.
2. Re-achievement of continuous symmetric pattern with rewarming.
