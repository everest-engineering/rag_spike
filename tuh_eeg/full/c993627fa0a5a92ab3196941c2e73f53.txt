DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, 80 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta in the background. Hyperventilation does no activate the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no focal nor epileptiform features in this primarily awake record. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study capturing sleep may be considered.
