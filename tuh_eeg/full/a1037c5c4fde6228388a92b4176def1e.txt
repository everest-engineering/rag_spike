MEDICATIONS:
Xanax, last used two days ago, Lovenox, Keppra and Tylenol.

INTRODUCTIONS:
Digital video EEG was done using the standard 10 to 20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
There is awake and drowsy record. In wakefulness, the alpha is 11 Hz. There is a lot of beta frequency activity bilaterally. Hyperventilation is characterized by some slowing of the record and bursts of high amplitude, and sharply contoured activity. There is also alpha sub harmonic seen in the later stages of hyperventilation. Photic stimulation was done during stage II sleep and it elicits driving. Stage II sleep was seen in the recording characterized by spindle K-complexes and vertex waves.

IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG awake through stage II sleep.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Normal EEG, does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a clinical consideration, please consider a sleep EEG or EEG recording of longer duration.
