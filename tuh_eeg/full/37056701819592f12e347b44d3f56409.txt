CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right-handed woman with confusion, brain tumor, craniopharyngioma, right-sided craniectomy, dementia, blindness, diabetes, and either fever or hypothermia.
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Lorazepam, Fentanyl, Lovenox, tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage mixed frequency, primarily theta frequency pattern. The activity is somewhat higher on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta frequency activity. Occipitally predominant triangular shaped waves are noted which are higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. It is not clear if these may represent posts. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Amplitude asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized background slowing is a nonspecific finding supporting a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The amplitude asymmetry may be related to her previous craniotomy. To further characterize epileptiform activity a repeat study when she it out of ICU may be of use.
