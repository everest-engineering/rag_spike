History:	56 YR FEMALE S/P CABG X3 4/22 POST OP PT EXPERIENCING SHORT TERM
MEMORY LOSS.  R/O TRANS GLOBAL AMNESIA VS, SZ, VS DELIRIUM
Medications:	OXYCODONE PRN, MORPHINE PRN,  BENADRYL PRN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient has a short sleep latency.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The short sleep latency may be suggestive of
a sleep disturbance and a sleep evaluation may be beneficial if clinically indicated.
