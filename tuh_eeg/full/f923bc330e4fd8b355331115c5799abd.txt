History:	35 year old woman who was found to have left transverse sinus thrombosis.
Medications:	TOPIRAMATE, LAMICTAL,  CELEXA,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The posterior
dominant rhythm consists of 10-11 Hz alpha activity with expected AP gradient.  Subtle underriding
diffuse theta activity is captured.  Continuous polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta
activity is noted over the left, especially over the left frontotemporal central region.  No clear
epileptiform discharges are captured but occasional left TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic
delta activity) is captured.  Patient is able to perform tasks throughout the activity.  During
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and degree of theta activity increases.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), occasional, left
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left, primarily frontocentral temporal
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing and (2) continuous
left frontocentral temporal that is at times rhythmic over the temporal region (TIRDA (temporal
intermittent rhythmic delta activity)). Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal
structural lesion in the left.  TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) indicates an
increased epileptogenic potential emanating from the left temporal region.  No clinical or
