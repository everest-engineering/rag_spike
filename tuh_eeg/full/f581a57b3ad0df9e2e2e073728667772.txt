CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old right handed woman, status post left craniotomy 20
years ago, right hemiparesis, no known history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and a sleep
record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a prominent craniotomy
defect with high amplitude, essentially continuous 6-7 Hz activity, typically 6.5 Hz at
times, reaching 440 microvolts. There is a well defined alpha rhythm of 9.5 Hz on the
right, 8.8 Hz on the left. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response on the right.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing from the left hemisphere primarily with a theta frequency
pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural process on the left
involving gray and white matter, but there were no epileptiform features noted in this
primarily drowsy record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, consider a repeat
study with sleep.
