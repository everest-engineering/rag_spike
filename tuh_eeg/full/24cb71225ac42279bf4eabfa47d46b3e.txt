History:	48 YO FEMALE WHO WENT TO HER REGULAR OP DIALYSIS CENTER WHERE
SHE SUDDENLY STARED AND WAS NOT TALKING FOR A FEW MIN. NO
ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS SEEN. BY THE TIME SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO
TUH SHE WAS BACK TO BASELINE. PMH: LEFT FRONTAL ICH, HTN, DM
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN, METOPROLOL, DIOVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
