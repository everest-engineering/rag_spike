CLINICAL HISTORY:  63-year-old male status post aneurysm repair in 1991, Alzheimer's dementia, PEG and trach.  Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent and at times slightly agitated.   This is a technically satisfactory EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is relatively somnolent.  There is a prominent asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The activity from the right is relatively low-voltage and featureless.  There is a prominent breach rhythm noted on the left with higher amplitude more sharply contoured activity and rhythmic, sharply contoured theta from the left hemisphere with phase reversal sometimes left frontal, sometimes left frontotemporal.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is intermittent paroxysmal attenuation following the bursts of rhythmic theta and/or sharp waves on the left.
Other sections of the record demonstrate more rhythmic theta and beta,  again more from the left hemisphere than the right.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A markedly low voltage and slow pattern on the right.
From the left, at times a discontinuous pattern and in the context of a breach rhythm, sharply contoured theta or sharp waves with a phase reversal in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  The epileptiform activity and the prominent slowing, as well as the attenuation was noted ipsilateral to the patient's  previous cranial surgery.  No seizures were recorded.
