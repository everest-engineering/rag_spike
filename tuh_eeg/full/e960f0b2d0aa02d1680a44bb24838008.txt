History:	73 year old woman with syncopal episodes.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is captured.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 25-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~54 bpm.
