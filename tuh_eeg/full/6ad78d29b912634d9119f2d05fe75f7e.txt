CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed female with left carotid endarterectomy for a 58-year-old woman with previous right carotid pathology.
MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, Carvedilol, ASA, Plavix
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat disorganized.  There is an asymmetry with an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm on the left, 9.5 on the right.  There is also prominent shifting slowing with some sharply contoured slowing on the left and even left temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an accentuation of the left temporal focal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized background.
Shifting slowing with a slower alpha rhythm on the right compared to the left.
Sharply contoured left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Similar findings have been noted in her previous EEG for the right carotid endarterectomy earlier this year, but the features on the left are a bit more prominent today.
