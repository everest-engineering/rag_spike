CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old male with epilepsy, medication nonadherence, the patient was admitted with recurrent seizures and low phenytoin level.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had been relatively somnolent.  The patient was drowsy and relatively tremulous during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG demonstrates a diffuse theta pattern with 5 hertz theta, generous beta and muscle tremble artifact.  The patient demonstrates spontaneous arousals, particularly as the recording continues, and is intermittently scratching.  When unstimulated, he drifts off to sleep.  He is able to answer some questions, but when unstimulated, drifts off to sleep with occasional FIRDA.
Heart rate:  78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Prominent beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen in this somewhat limited EEG.  Previous EEGs are not available at this time for comparison.  If additional information is needed, a repeat study when the patient is a bit more cooperative is suggested.
