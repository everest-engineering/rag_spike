History:	80 year old woman with a recent left frontal ICH.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude 9 Hz activity
that attenuates with eyes opening.  The AP gradient is present.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV,
5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  Normal sleep
architecture, including vertex waves and sleep spindles, is present.
Intermittent bilateral (left>right) polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior temporal
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
intermittent bilateral (left>right) focal anterior temporal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in
origin.  Some degree of temporal slowing is considered normal in patients over the age of 65 yo,
but the degree of  bitemporal slowing in this patient is pathologically high.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
