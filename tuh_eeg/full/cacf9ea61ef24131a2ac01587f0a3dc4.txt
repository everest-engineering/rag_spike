CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old gentleman with history of HIV, undetectable viral load, and an episode of altered mental status.  Episodes of confusion and fatigue.  Prior left pontine infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, no others reported.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  The patient was quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage, but there is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta and an increase in frontal central beta.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles were noted in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  75 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 1-hour EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this adult.  If epilepsy is an important consideration and ambulatory record, capturing this patient's clinical symptoms may be of value.
