History:	76 year old woman who presents with sepsis and change in mental status.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, lethargic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology
are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase
lag and appear with stimulation.  When patient falls asleep, triphasic waveforms resolve and the
background consists of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta activity and periods
of brief background discontinuity.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, abundant, with stimulation
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing
and abundant triphasic waveforms. These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Triphasic
waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and
anoxia.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
