History:	26 year old woman with reported seizures and a prior stroke.
Medications:	Paxil, Temazepam, Depakote, Fluphenazine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  A single event characterized
by eye closure, eye flutter, foaming from the mouth, non-responsiveness and subtle high frequency
head bobbing is captured.  At the end patient cannot recall her name and is slow to respond.  The
event lasts ~ 3 min 20 seconds.  Diffuse muscle artifact, eye flutter artifact and movement artifact
with underlying normal background are captured during the event.  EEG is reviewed during the
event and patient is evaluated with the attending physician after the episode ends.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Other, 1 event with no EEG correlate
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake-only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. A single event characterized by eye closure, eye flutter, foaming from the
mouth, non-responsiveness and subtle high frequency head bobbing has no abnormal ictal EEG
