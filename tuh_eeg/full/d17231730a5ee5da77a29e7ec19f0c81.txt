CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old left handed woman with developmental delay, epilepsy, fatigue, lack of appetite.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized.  There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but excess theta particularly in the frontocentral regions.  The alpha rhythm is sometimes disrupted. Hyperventilation produces rhythmic posteriorly predominant mixed theta-delta. There were brief sections of the record with arousal with a well-organized background and a faster alpha rhythm of 10 Hz, but again with frontocentral theta. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Brief stage 1 sleep with vertex waves was identified. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Excess theta particularly in the frontal regions.
A small amount of background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this young adult.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study can be considered.  Alternatively, comparison with her pediatric records may be of use.
