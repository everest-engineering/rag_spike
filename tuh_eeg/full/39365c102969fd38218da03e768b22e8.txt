History:	34 yr old woman presents with possible epileptic vs non-epileptic events
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient is awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
