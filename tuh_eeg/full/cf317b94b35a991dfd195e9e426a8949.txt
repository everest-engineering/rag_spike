REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman who presents with worsening right-sided weakness and a headache, history of HIV, cervical cancer and multiple cerebral infarcts.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and asleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges which included photic stimulation.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Slow waves seen at F7/T3 and sometimes at F3 independently with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal sharp waves seen at CZ.  Please see below in seizures.
SEIZURES:  There are intermittent sharply contoured focal slow waves that occur periodically throughout the recording and in the mid central region correlate with right leg twitching consistent with cortical discharge and a simple partial seizure.  They occurred multiple times throughout the recording.  They do not appear to evolve or increase in rhythm or spread anywhere.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing as well as simple partial seizures arising from the central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal simple partial seizures arising from the central region, which are consistent with the known lesions in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is also consistent with the lesions. This report was dictated and communicated to the team.
