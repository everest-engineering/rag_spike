History:	72 year old woman found unresponsive with left sided weakness.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for  ~15 hours from 1/18/2015 till 1/19/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  With stimulation, the background consists of low amplitude
slow delta activity admixed with underriding very low amplitude fast activity.  During periods of
quiescence, delta activity is mostly replaced by attenuated fast activity.
A paced heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Other, background is reactive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous video 15-hour EEG due to severe diffuse slowing. These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No focal features are
present on this recording to explain patient's left sided weakness.  These findings were conveyed to
the primary team.
