History:	56 YO MALE WAS AT A BAR WHEN HE COLLAPSED OFF STOOL.HE WAS DOWN
5 MIN. BEFORE EMS ARRIVAL AT WHICH TIME HE WAS FOUND TO BE IN
ASYSTOLE.CPR WAS INITIATED W 3 ROUNDS OF EPI AND ROSC WAS
ACHIEVED. UPON ARRIVAL HE WAS HYPOTHERMIC 94.3 & LATER
Medications:	06/08- VALPROATE AND DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse almost
completely attenuated activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Periodic central maximal (with a large posterior field) synchronous
complex polyphasic sharp waves with a repetition rate of 1-3 Hz.  On video the patient exhibit
subtle facial jerks associated to the periodic sharp waves, consistent with myoclonus.  This pattern
becomes slightly more prominent with stimulation.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84.
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous central
Attenuation, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) that
are central maximal with associated myoclonus and attenuation.  In the setting of hypoxic injury
these findings are indicative of diffuse cortical irritability and dysfunction which is suggestive of a
very poor prognosis.  This EEG is mainly unchanged from the previous one performed  06/04/2015.
