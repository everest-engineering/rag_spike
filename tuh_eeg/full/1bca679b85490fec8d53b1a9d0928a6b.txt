History: 20 YR FEMALE WHO IS 27 WKS PREGNANT WITH EPISODE OF SYNCOPE FELT
NAUSEOUS, RAPID HEART BEAT/ LOC X10 MIN WITH POST DIZZY. PT HAD HAIR
WEAVE IN MUCH GLUE IN HAIR. HEAD 57 CM
Medications: NEONATAL VIT.

Sedation:

EEG Type: Awake & asleep, neonatal
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 1OHz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal stowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1Â·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Posterior
electrode artifact due to weave. The tech attempted to fix. HR 60
Summary of Findings:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake,  Drowsy, and asleep
