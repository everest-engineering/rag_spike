History:	48 YR  OLD MALE FOR FOLLOW UP EEG, PMHX OF MULTIPLE SZ IN 1 DAY, PT
DENIES ANY RECENT SZ ACTIVITY.
Medications:	Gabapentin, Norvasc
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis
