CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old right handed woman evaluated for seizure versus syncope. History of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Simvastatin, Calcium, Lisinopril, Vit, B12
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is
appropriately organized for age with a 10 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified. The bad electrode should have been fixed during the study.
