History:	SUICIDAL IDEATION, DEPRESSION, DECREASED JUDGMENT, DECREASED
SLEEP, POOR SELF CARE
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is no posterior dominant rhythm is noted. The background is characterized by a mixture of
moderate voltage theta and delta activity.  Symmetric beta activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During stage 1 and 2 sleep were characterized by POSTS and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes.  Brief arousals are characterized by high-voltage, synchronous, 3-
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the left temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No alpha rhythm, with slowing of the background
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG capturing the patient in a drowsy and sleep state because of diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  intermittent focal slowing in the left  temporal region.  This finding may indicate
focal cerebral dysfunction.  No electrographic seizures are present.
