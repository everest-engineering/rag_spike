CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed female with a history of epilepsy since
2005, with tonic-clonic seizures followed by postictal confusion. Last seizure was in May
of this year. She had a cluster of seizures at that time.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in Jab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm but there is excess background theta. The background is somewhat poorly
organized. In wakefulness, hyperventilation and into stage II sleep there are frontally
predominant high amplitude spike and wave complexes. Although these are bilateral,
with a transverse montage, they are maximum in the right frontal region. They can be
identified into stage II sleep with vertex waves, spindles and posts. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage II sleep. Despite this, a driving response is elicited.
HR: 84 pm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity which is maximal on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging but are
more supportive of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
