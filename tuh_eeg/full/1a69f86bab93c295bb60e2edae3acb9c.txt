NOW.  IN ER TEMP 102.9.  NOW 98.6.  AGAIN NOTE IMP BELOW 10 OHMS   PT
UNCOOPERATIVE FOR HOOKUP
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan 2MG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at O1.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Some reactivity to tactile and verbal
stimuli.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Sharp waves, occasional, left occipital
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of   epileptiform discharges in the left occipital region.  These
findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region.In addition there is
diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
