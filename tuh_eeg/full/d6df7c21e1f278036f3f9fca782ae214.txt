History:	78 YO FEMALE BROUGHT IN BY DAUGHTER FOR BLANK STARE AND FACIAL
TWITCHING LASTING 5 MIN. PT HAD 2 GTC SZ'S IN ED PMHX: LRE, DEMENTIA,
HTN, ANXIETY, BIPOLAR
Medications:	Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG
does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
