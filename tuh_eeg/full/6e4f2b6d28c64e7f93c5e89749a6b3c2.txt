History:	44 year old woman who suffered a reported status epilepticus in 9/2015.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left anterior temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to occasional mild left anterior
temporal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin.
