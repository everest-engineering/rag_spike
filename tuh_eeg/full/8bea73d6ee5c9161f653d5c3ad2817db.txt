CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old lady with past medical history of subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2007, status post hypertension and asthma and also history of seizures with left-sided weakness secondary to old stroke, presents for episodes of stuttering speech and right upper extremity shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Norvasc, Prozac, Prilosec, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, and presence of posts, K complexes, vertex sharp transients, and sleep spindles.  There are also intermittent bursts of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies, and results in a symmetric driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in slowing of the background activity.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness due to bitemporal slowing.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Bitemporal slowing is suggestive of bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures. If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG or continuous bedside EEG or ambulatory, an EEG monitoring maybe helpful.
