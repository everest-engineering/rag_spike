History:	65 with events concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Gabapentin, Heparin, Protonix, Asa, Nifedipine, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Advair,
Heparin, Levothyroxine, Atorvastatin, Calcium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal the PDR reaches 9 Hz alpha activity.  Throughout the majority of the
recording PDR is 7 Hz.  The AP gradient is weak.  During drowsiness, the amount of theta activity
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG because of mild diffuse slowing that is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
