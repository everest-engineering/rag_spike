CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed female with history of seizures, status postAVM in the left temporal region removed 5 years ago. The patient had been seizure free until December 2008 when she started having break through seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were both performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with intermittent left temporal focal slowing. Drowsiness and hyperventilation both accentuates the focal theta from the left temporal region. In hyperventilation the focal slowing is sustained. In drowsiness it is sometimes sharply contoured at 7. Photic stimulation elicits driving.

HR: 66bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive sharp waves were identified on this record. The focal slowing is in the region of the AVM resection. If further information Is needed a repeated study is suggested.
