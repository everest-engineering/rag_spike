CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old right handed male with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Tegretol
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  During this section of the record, the patient was less confused.  No seizures were recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG continues to demonstrate a markedly slow record.  There are some sections in wakefulness where the primary frequency is delta rather than theta.  There are bursts of sharply contoured delta noted from the right or left temporal region.
The patient falls asleep in a chair.  The sleep pattern is relatively slow but not clearly defined as slow wave sleep.  This section of the record includes a bit more sharp waves from the right and there are some slow periodic sharps on the right.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves on the right.
Focal sharp waves.
Markedly disorganized background
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This long-term EEG monitoring demonstrated a very slow background.  The patient's preexisting left temporal sharp waves were noted, but there were also some on the right.  Activity in the right or bilateral occipital region is be a new finding for this individual.
