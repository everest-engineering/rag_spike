HISTORY:
A 64-year-old woman, transferred on Wednesday night after acute left-sided weakness, left facial
droop. The patient with persistent obtundation, confusion and waxing and waning motor strength. Right PCA infarct and
left ACA infarcts
MEDICATIONS:
Hydrochlorothiazide, insulin and others.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 1 0/20 system of electrode placement with one
channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall frequencies include a mixture of theta and delta. There are
intermittent bursts of high-amplitude, sharply contoured delta with a phase reversal at F7-F3.
Stimulation of the patient produces some faster theta frequency activity
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Marked, higher amplitude left frontal delta and sharply contoured delta theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Although the largest infarct is in the right PCA distribution, the most prominent abnormalities in this EEG are in the left
frontal reg1on It is difficult to identify an alpha rhythm from either hemisphere in this drowsy individual.
No seizures were seen
