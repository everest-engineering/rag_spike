History:	40 year old man with long-standing epilepsy, now presents with increase in seizure
frequency.
Medications:	DILANTIN, LAMICTAL, BACLOFEN, SEROQUEL, CELEXA, NEURONTIN, VITAMIN.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing and several bursts of diffuse theta and delta activity.  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Patient sweats
profoundly throughout the recording. This affects the quality of EEG leads.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1-hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on
a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
