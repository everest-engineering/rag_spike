History:	90 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS FROM NURSING HOME WITH H/O
CATARACTS, GLAUCOMA, WEAKNESS, DYSPHAGIA, OROPHARYNGEAL
PHASE, DEMENTIA AND HTN. EEG TO EVAL FOR SZ.
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, OLANZAPINE, ESCITALOPRAM, ACETAMINOPHEN,
CYANOCOBALAMIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, photic
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-100Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Short sleep latency.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The short sleep latency may indicate a sleep
disorder.
