History:	73 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS FOR RT CEA, PMHX SIG FOR SEVERAL NEAR-
SYNCOPAL EPISODES IN 11/13, RT TIA W/LT SIDED SYMPTOMS X 2 WEEKS
AGO, CAD, CAROTID STENOSIS, AND LUNG NODULE ? FOR MALIGNANCY.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  During the procedure, diffuse theta and
delta were seen due to sedation. The right common carotid was clamped at 11:54.21 AM. The
right internal carotid was clamped at 11:54.32 AM.  There was no background change noted on the
EEG. The carotid was unclamped at 12:41PM.
Summary of Findings:
