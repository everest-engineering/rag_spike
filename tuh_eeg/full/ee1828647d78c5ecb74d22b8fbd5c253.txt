EEG REPORT
CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old woman admitted on 05/25/2010 with anoxic
encephalopathy following house fire.
MEDICATIONS: Midazolam, Morphine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and
febrile.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage
but continuous pattern. There is low voltage beta and alpha frequency activity in the
central regions and delta activity in the remaining or the record. There is some
variability in the record and in this bedside recording questionable shifting asymmetries
in the right frontal central region. Stimulation or the patient does not clearly activate the
record.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a lower voltage pattern with lower
voltage delta and smaller amounts of faster frequency activity.
2. Small amounts of 8-9 Hertz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study, 24 hours after anoxic encephalopathy would
carry an intermediate prognosis. This is particularly important because of these
sedative hypnotic medications. Clinical evaluation and follow up studies are important
as !here is clearly a cerebral pattern here and the use of hypnotic medications may
have played a role in the pattern described above.
