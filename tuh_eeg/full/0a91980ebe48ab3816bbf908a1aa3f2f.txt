CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old woman with hepatitis C, admitted with GI bleed, not sedated for several days but not waking up, active GI bleeding during examination.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Synthroid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with mixed frequency irregular theta and delta.  There is intermittent irregular delta.  Gentle stimulation does not particularly activate the record, but more significant noxious stimulation clearly results in an alerting response with an increase in theta frequency activity.
HR:   110 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mixed frequency background.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The mixed frequency background with a slow pattern is a nonspecific finding.  It supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There were no epileptiform features and no specific hallmarks of a hepatic encephalopathy.  The reactivity to stimuli is an anticipated finding in a metabolic encephalopathy.
