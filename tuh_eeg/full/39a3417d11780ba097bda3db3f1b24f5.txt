History:	71 year old man undergoing left CEA.

INCISION: 11:58AM
HEPARIN 7000U 1:37P, 2000U 1:50 PM 2000  2:49P
CLAMP:   2:07/2:09PM
Medications:	VERSED, PROPOFOL, VECURONIUM, ISOFLURANE, PHENYLEPHRINE,
FENTANYL, LIDOCAINE, NITROUS OXIDE, ANCEF
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
Patient is awake in the beginning of the recording with 9 Hz PDR and normal AP gradient
observed.  Intubation occurs at ~11:05 pm with gradual change in the background to low amplitude
diffuse fast activity.  Clamp is at 2:07 PM with no appreciable change observed. The artery is
unclamped at ~3:33 PM with no appreciable change observed.  There appearance of excessive
EMG artifact at ~ 3:47 pm.  EEG technologists notifies the anesthesia and propofol is initiated.
That results is cessation of EMG artifact.  When monitoring is stopped at ~4:37 pm, the background
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This was unremarkable nearly 6 hour continuous EEG monitoring performed for left carotid
endarterectomy.  Clamping that lasted 1 hour 26 minutes did not result in appreciable changes in
the background/ asymmetry.
