CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 42-year-old woman with new onset seizures.  Patient awakens with tongue biting, jerking, arm stiffness and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Fifty minute digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 70 mV posterior dominant rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were identified.
This was a sleep deprived EEG and the patient rapidly transitioned in and of stage II sleep.  She was awakened for hyperventilation, which produced an increase in amplitude of the background and then drifted immediately back into stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation was performed at the end of the record.  The patient was having trouble staying awake and was drifting in and out of stage II sleep, but there was a subtle driving response seen on one occasion.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute to 108 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen in today's EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Of note, the patient had an episode of tachycardia develop while asleep.
