CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old left-handed male with epilepsy.  Three generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which occur when he is talking to someone.  Heavy alcohol consumption.
MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Xanax, and Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION:  DIGITAL  Video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable, routine outpatient EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 8.7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.
Features of sleep include:  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta as well as background theta.
Photic stimulation elicits:  bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation elicits:  an increase in an amplitude of the background which was relatively symmetric.
Notable in this record:
Heart rate: 96 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG, in wakefulness, and brief drowsiness with irregular heart rate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study may be of use.  If this patient is not known to have an irregular heart rate, additional evaluation may be considered. The EKG was sent to the PMD via EMR.
