History:	81 year old woman who is unresponsive.
Medications:	No AEDs, no sedation listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of low amplitude
polymorphic theta << delta activity, with delta activity being more pronounced and theta activity
seen primarily posteriorly.  Intermittent diffuse triphasic waveforms are noted.  No normal sleep
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
No reactivity
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Triphasic waves, intermittent
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse background
slowing and lack of reactivity. These findings are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Lack of background reactivity is a poor prognostic
indicator.  No electrographic seizures are present.
