CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old right handed male with epilepsy, history of craniotomy 7
years ago for intracerebral hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin,Â· HCTZ, Folic Acid, ASA, Ativan, Thiamine, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. The patient is
relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is a
clear symmetry with a lower voltage slow pattern on the left with generous beta. The right
demonstrates a breech rhythm with prominent fast activity and bursts of both fast activity and a
sharp wave which is picked up at C4, T 4. This sharp wave has a generous field of spread into
the right anterior and posterior temporal region as well as through the right central region. The
patient is awake as the epileptiform activity continues and arouses and is interactive despite the
prominent sharp waves. These sharp waves do not evolve, but they are seen every 1-2
seconds. They are associated with faster frequency activity. Photic stimulation does not appear
to activate the record.
HR: 102 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere including right central and
temporal region with bursts of beta at C4.
2. Right sided hemisphere focal slowing.
3. Moderate background slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The prominent breech rhythm may accentuate the epileptiform
activity. Though this is a PLEDS plus pattern, there is no frequency evolution of the epileptiform
activity described above.
