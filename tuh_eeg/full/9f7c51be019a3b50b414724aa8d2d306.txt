CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old female with breast caner, metastasis to the bone
and right frontal cranium with left focal seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background includes a
dynamic pattern with a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm interrupted by bursts of
paroxysmal, somewhat irregular, bilateral delta. There are a handful of triphasic waves
noted in the background. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background
delta with vertex waves in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation is remarkable for
photoelectric artifact.
HR. 60 to 80 bpm and Irregular
IMPRESSION: abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Paroxysmal bilateral delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed. In addition,
the features described above are really more of a generalized rather than a focal
pattern. Correlation with imaging and clinical history Is advised.
