Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed, but no hyperventilation was done.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at low amplitude with a frequency of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an increased amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  Normal sleep architecture  stage 1 sleep is seen.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The increased amount of frontocentral beta may be due to benzodiazepines the patient is taking.
