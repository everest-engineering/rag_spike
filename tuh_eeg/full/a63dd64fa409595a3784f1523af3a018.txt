CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year old right handed female with history of seizure since childhood, recently stopped medications due to bypass which was Depakote. States having episodes of loss of time.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, ASA, Vitamins.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and stage I sleep was recorded. Activating procedure including photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well performed posterior dominant rhythm of 9 hertz with an amplitude of  20 to 60 microvolts. There is normal frontocentral beta seen. Sleep is characterized by stage I. Activating procedures with photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized spike and waves at 4 hertz with an amplitude of 50 to 100 microvolts. The bursts are seen maximally anteriorly and symmetrically over both hemispheres and the longest burst lasts about 3.5 seconds.
There is independent delta at T3 and T4 seen at 2-4 hertz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  General spike and waves and independent bitemporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals findings consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. In addition, there is evidence of independent bitemporal delta which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures were seen.
