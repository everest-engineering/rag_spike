History:	63 YR FEMALE WITH H/O  SZS..  FOLLOW UP EEG.  LAST SZ MARCH/13
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Rare focal spike-and-wave discharges and sharp waves are present with
phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7/T3.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the
left fronto temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic  focus in
this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy.
