CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with right MCA CVA, recurrent episodes of unresponsiveness with an episode of unresponsiveness on the 23rd.
MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Zocor, ASA, Famotidine, Hydralazine, Keppra, Flexeril, Metoprolol, Amlodipine, Nicotine Patch
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the left The alpha is relatively disrupted on the right. In wakefulness, particularly in the initial sections of the record, there is sharply-contoured slowing and sharp waves maximum in the left temporal region. There are occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. The epileptiform activity with left temporal sharp waves is noted primarily in the initial sections of the record. Photic stimulation is performed at the close of the record. There Is a scant driving response more so on the left than the right.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Arrhythmic delta activity and sharply contoured delta activity in the left temporal region.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
3. Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a previous study April 8. Of note, there is more epileptiform activity in this record in comparison to the previous. The disruption of faster frequency activity on the left is compatible with a stroke on the right but the epileptiform activity is noted from the left hemisphere.
