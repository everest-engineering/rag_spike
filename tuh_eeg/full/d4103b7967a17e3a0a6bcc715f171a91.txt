History:	46 y/o man with MR and epilepsy since birth here for EMU monitoring,
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
Keppra, Lamictal
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. One seizure: While asleep there is a sudden diffuse attenuation followed by diffuse muscle artifact on the EEG. Clinically the patient wakes up form sleep and exhibits bilateral arm and leg extension with tonic stiffening with an associated low guttural moan.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, one diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of a single tonic seizure with diffuse attenuation. In addition to diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are consistent with a symptomatic generalized epilepsy and moderate diffuse cerebral function.
