History:	38 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF SZ W/O? LOC.
PT WAS TOLD SHE STAIRS, BLINKS QUICKLY, AND SHAKES FOR SEVERAL
MINUTES. PT DOES NOT RECALL ANYTHING.
Medications:	Depakote?
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  There is REM sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
