CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old male with neuro-migration abnormality, heterotopia and pachygyria, admitted after a cluster of seizures with low Dilantin and phenobarbital levels, now with rhabdomyolysis and diffuse myalgias.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, phenobarbital and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Bedside EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was initially quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low-voltage pattern with intermittent bursts of lower voltage beta.  Occasional vertex waves were noted.  Stimulation of the patient produces some vertex activity and some bursts of shifting slowing with sharply contoured slowing noted from left or right on rare occasions.
Stimulation of the patient produced a brief alerting with a lower voltage beta pattern.
HEART RATE:  90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low-voltage slow pattern.
Rare bursts of left or right sharply contoured slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG described above may be due to postictal state or pharmacological sedation.  There were wave forms compatible with normal sleep, such as vertex activity and spindle.  This is the second EEG for this patient, again recorded in the postictal state, which has not identified well-defined epileptiform activity.  A followup outpatient study may be of value.
