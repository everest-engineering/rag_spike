Medications:	KEPPRA, PROPOFOL, AMPICILLIN, DEPACON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation of any activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is irregular and 72. However the
EKG electrodes has an artifact and is limited.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background attenuation and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
