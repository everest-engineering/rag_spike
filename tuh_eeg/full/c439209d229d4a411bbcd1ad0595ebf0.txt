CLINICAL HISTORY:  Brain mass with vasogenic edema, status post left craniotomy, hematoma, and parietal tumor extraction.  The patient previously sedated, but slow to improve.  Clostridium difficile infection.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Decadron.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient was relative relatively somnolent and tachypneic throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow, low voltage pattern.  With alteration in the sensitivity, it is possible to visualize a bit more slow activity in the left hemisphere than the right.  Spontaneous arousals can be noted on the EEG with the patient moving just a little bit and some rhythmic 5 Hz activity in the occipital regions, although behaviorally, the patient is unchanged.
Auditory stimulation of the patient did produce a 3-to 4-second arousal with a bit more theta.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG for this critically ill and uncomfortable patient is remarkable.
A markedly slow background.
A subtle asymmetry with a bit more slow activity in the left hemisphere.
Electrographic evidence of an arousal in a patient, who does not seem to be particularly interactive.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features described above are quite subtle and may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.  Overall, this EEG is most compatible with a bi-hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function and in addition to these CNS processes, some features of this picture may include a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
