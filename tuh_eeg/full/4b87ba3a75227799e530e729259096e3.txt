REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old man with history of seizures, attempted suicide, found at the bottom of the stairs with a sheet around his neck confused, found to have hydrocephalus, subdural, subarachnoid, and an EVD placed, has eye twitching and right sided gaze deviation with anxiety, depression, pancreatitis and schizophrenia/bipolar.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamictal, phenobarbital, paroxetine, trazodone, Prilosec, Percocet as needed, hydroxyzine, meloxicam, vancomycin, Zofran, Zosyn, Ativan and Versed as needed.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an absent posterior dominant rhythm without any normal frontocentral beta.  Overall, the background is disorganized and has data slowing seen continuously throughout it.  In addition, there is continuous frontal eye movements throughout the recording.
Activating procedures were not performed and no normal sleep architecture was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
