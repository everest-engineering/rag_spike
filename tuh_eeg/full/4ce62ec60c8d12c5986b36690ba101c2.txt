History:	50yo M with refractory localization-related epilepsy due to right mesial temporal
sclerosis. Here for WADA testing.
Medications:	ZONISAMIDE, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
First injection on the right carotid was at 11:14AM which produced a nice focal slowing over the
right hemisphere with minimal slowing seen on the left hemisphere.  Second injection on the left
carotid was at 11:51AM which produced a nice focal slowing over the left hemisphere with minimal
slowing seen on the right hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep with normal changes during a WADA.
