CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an adult female with past history of lung cancer and aneurysm, prior status epilepticus. Evaluate for involuntary ocular movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, Keppra, Lasix, antibiotics, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient seemed to be at times upset or agitated, but did follow commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with primarily theta frequency background theta.  The patient received Dilaudid during the EEG to reduce her involuntary movements.  Superimposed upon a diffuse slow theta pattern, there are some left posterior temporal sharp waves noted.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in arrhythmic delta activity seen from both hemispheres, but a little bit more prominent from the left.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
The patient was observed to have some of the involuntary movements.  The Neurology resident felt that they looked like it a dyskinesia and the technologist felt that the involuntary movements in the oral and facial muscles indicated that the patient was trying to communicate.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
Occasional sharp waves at the left posterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is markedly improved compared to others.  There were no seizures recorded and periodic activity was absent.  The diffuse background slowing supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as might be anticipated in this critically ill patient.
