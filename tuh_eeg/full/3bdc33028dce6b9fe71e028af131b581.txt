CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old woman transferred for cardiogenic shock status post LAD stent, now continuous hemodialysis and possible cardiac arrest.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Vasopressin, Insulin, Protonix, Lorazepam, Protonix, Fentanyl
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was unresponsive during the exam.  No activating procedures other than ocular stimulation and peripheral stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  When stimulated, there is no change on the recording.  There is otherwise a very low amplitude diffusely slow recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There is focal slowing continuously seen at F7/T3 throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves and low amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the left frontal region.
Generalized low amplitude slow waves with lack of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction with lack of reactivity.  Please note that this EEG is markedly changed from the previous one where there was some reactivity as well as some alpha periodicity in the frontal region.  No seizures were seen.
