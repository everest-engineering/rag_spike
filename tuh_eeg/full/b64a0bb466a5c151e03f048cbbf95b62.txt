CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year old male with recurrent syncope. History of dementia,
diabetes, hypertension and arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Lisinopril, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode went with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. The patient is quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 10
Hz alpha rhythm, but there a small amount of 6Hz beta noted in the background. The
patient rapidly drifts off to sleep with a small amount of shifting slowing in sleep. Vertex
waves are noted in sleep. K-complexes are also observed. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta in wakefulness.
2. Shifting slowing a little greater than expected for age and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a more prolonged study can be obtained. The excess theta and
shifting slowing in sleep, mild abnormalities in an adult of this age and may be
correlated with imaging a dementia history.
