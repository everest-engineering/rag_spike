History:	23 year old man with a history of generalized convulsions.  Patient was not on AEDs
when his last seizure occurred due to lack of medical insurance.
Medications:	Phenytoin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Two brief bursts (~2.5 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal spike-and-wave discharges and
polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of ~4.5-5 Hz.  Additionally,
several isolated frontally predominant generalized spike-and-wave discharges are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, two, 4.5-5 Hz rate, bursts lasting ~2.5 sec
Spike-and-wave complexes, occasional generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 25 minute EEG due to occasional fast generalized spike-
and-wave and polyspike-and-wave discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  These findings
are suggestive of a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
