DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: routine, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1356
HISTORY:
52 y.o. female referred for routine EEG as a follow up study.	She had been found unresponsive by her family. History of HIV and seizures, prominent left frontal scalp nondepressed fracture with extension to the orbital roof.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, Tivicay, Prezcobix, Emtriva SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients , with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
