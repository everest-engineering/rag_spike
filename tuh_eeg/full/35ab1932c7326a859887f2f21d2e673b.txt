DATE OF STUDY:  The EEG was from 03/04/2013 to 03/05/2013, for a total of 20 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old man with episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures diagnosed with epilepsy 2 years ago, now with staring spells with a metallic taste and sleep, waking confused.  He has had 2 episodes of drop attacks following head turning to the right and shaking with tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to the patient's events and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were recorded in these 24-hours of long-term monitoring admission.
