History:	25 year old woman with a history of Lupus, now presents with several convulsions in
the setting of increased blood pressure.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 08/30/2015 to 08/31/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of low amplitude diffuse slow delta
activity with frequent diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms.  As the recording progresses, voltages
increases somewhat.  With stimulation, diffuse low-to-moderate amplitude  polymorphic delta
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous 24-hour video EEG due to severe diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this
patient it is partially medication induced.  When compared to the prior recording epoch, voltage
attenuation and background slowing are  less severe.  No electrographic seizures are present.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
