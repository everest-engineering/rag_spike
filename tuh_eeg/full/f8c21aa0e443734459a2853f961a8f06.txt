CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old female admitted on June 19, 2012 with a Tylenol overdose, hepatic failure.  EEG monitoring requested for treatment management with pentobarbital coma.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Propofol.  Propofol was withdrawn.
INTRODUCTION:  Continue digital video EEG was monitored at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.  She was reported to have had some twitching during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern.
June 30 through July 1, 2012:  This section of the record demonstrates a pattern with generous delta and bursts of beta.  Eye movement is noted.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record.
By 9:00 p.m. there seems to be more muscle artifact.  There is also some alpha and theta frequency activity noted at that time.  It is not a great deal of activity, but there is some.  Muscle artifact again is noted later in the evening. Throughout the first 24 hour section there is certainly variability in the amount of beta and delta.
July 1 through July 2, 2012:  This section of the record continues to demonstrate a pattern with various amounts of delta and beta.
By 6:31 a.m. on July 1, 2012 there is more theta noted in the background.  Eye movement artifact is also observed.  Particularly at 8:00 a.m., there are brief sections with additional faster frequency activity, including alpha and theta frequency activity.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG monitoring session, was remarkable for:
A markedly slow pattern.
A variable pattern with some evidence of arousal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  No seizures were recorded.  The variability noted in this record, in this clinical context, is a positive prognostic feature.
