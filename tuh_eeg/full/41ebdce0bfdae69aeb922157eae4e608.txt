CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed female with epilepsy for the last 35
years, last seizure 3 months ago with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.
Currently with headache and neck pain.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG
includes a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is excess beta and theta noted in the
background. In early drowsiness there is intermittent, focal slowing from the left
temporal region with a mixture of theta and delta. There are also some central sharp
waves noted and bursts of focal slowing. In addition, wicket is identified from both
temporal regions, but from the left hemisphere there are more clearly defined sharp
waves with some irregular slowing. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate some of the
focal slowing and sharp waves, particularly as the patient-becomes-drowsy after
hyperventilation. Photic stimulation does elicit a bilateral driving response.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left temporal region.
2. left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for
epilepsy. â•–
