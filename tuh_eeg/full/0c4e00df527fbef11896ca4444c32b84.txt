CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old male with cerebral palsy and epilepsy since birth, seizure free for the last 4 years.

MEDICATIONS: ZONEGRAN
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed.  This was an awake and drowsy record in the patient who could not fall asleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz, symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  The patient was noted to have intermittent grunting.   Intermittent drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, but sleep was not sustained.

Photic stimulation did not activate the record.

Heart rate:  120 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and briefly drowsy record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged sleep study could be obtained.
