CLINICAL HISTORY:  Migraine headache.  Patient requires clearance for driver's license.
This is a 26-year-old woman with epilepsy at age 9, seizure-free since November 2013.  Patient experiences rusty taste in her mouth followed by exhaustion.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms.  Some head rocking artifact was noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm.  Prominent temporal wicket was noted.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic central theta.  POSTS were noted in stage 1 sleep.
At the close of the record, the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 4th EEG for this patient.  Previous studies were performed February 6, 2004, March 28, 2005, and May 7, 2013.  The 2013 study was normal as this study.  No epileptiform features were noted.
