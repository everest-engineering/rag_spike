History:	62 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF VERTIGO AND SYNCOPE EVENTS.  PT WITH MANY
FALLS.  SHE STATES HAS FALLEN OUT OF BED SEVERAL TIMES WHILE JUST
LAYING THERE???.   PMHX: HTN, DM, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, COPD
Medications:	CYMBALTA, NEURONTIN, TRADJENTA, KLONOPIN, ZOCOR, ZESTORETIC,
PROTONIX, HUMIRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal
regions (left more than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal regions (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
