CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old female with history of seizures, presents with multiple seizures and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Topamax, Neurontin, Percocet.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, but mainly in sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background, however, there are short episodes of wakefulness where for very short periods there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz that appears somewhat reactive to eye opening.  Otherwise, the patient, even while awake there appears to be some diffuse slowing and quickly drowses off to stage 1/stage 2 sleep.  There is some normal frontocentral beta seen in the short wakeful state.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts which is seen almost continuously throughout the recording and then quickly the patient goes into sleep.
There are some focal sharply contoured waveforms at F8/T4 seen on rare occasions.  Two of them had a clear morphology of BETS, however, one of them had a much higher amplitude and was suspicious for epileptiform activity.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that the single sharp epileptiform transient was only seen once and it is not clear if it is pathologic.
