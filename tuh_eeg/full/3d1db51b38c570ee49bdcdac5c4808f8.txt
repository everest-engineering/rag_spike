CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old male with a episode of garbled speech yesterday
which was transient. Past history of epilepsy 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Protonix, Zofran
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 7 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. There is a small degree of excess theta and background disorganization.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces an asymmetric
response with more prominent rhythmic theta delta from the right frontotemporal region
compared to the left. Following this as the patient becomes drowsy this asymmetry
persists. Photic stimulation is performed shortly after the hyperventilation and the
asymmetry remains. Photic stimulation does not otherwise activate the record.
Additional features of drowsiness include an inc..ease in background slowing which is
relatively symmetric.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left frontotemporal region, which is accentuated by
hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural functional process on the
left, as well as a mild, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
