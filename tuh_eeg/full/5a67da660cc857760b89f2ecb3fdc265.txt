CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old, right-handed woman with recent stroke, right carotid stenosis, baseline EEG for right carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with carotid endarterectomy montage.  This is a bedside portable EEG in a patient who had a great difficulty cooperating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is obscured by significant muscle and movement artifact.  There is generous beta noted throughout.  Despite this chaotic record, underlying focal delta can be identified in the right hemisphere particularly in the posterior quadrant.
Photic stimulation is obscured by muscle and movement artifact, but there is a suggestion of a driving response.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically very challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Superimposed right focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were reviewed with the endarterectomy team and will be used for the patient's baseline.
