CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old male with left subdural hematoma, craniotomy. Seizure on the 17th with tongue biting and 3-minute loss of consciousness.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Clindamycin, Morphine, Zofran, Gentamicin, Insulin, Lovenox, Mannitol, Famotidine, Hydralazine, Lopressor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears to be somewhat drowsy but there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified from either hemisphere. There is a rhythmic delta picked up intermittently from the left hemisphere, particularly at C3 in the left frontocentral region and at F7-T3 in the left frontotemporal region. As the patient becomes drowsy, the focal slowing in the left hemisphere is a bit more prominent. As the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness, there is left frontocentral rhythmics or delta.

HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing from the left frontocentral/frontotemporal region becoming more prominent in drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Of note, the EEG is best organized towards the end of the record when the patient is most awake. These findings are consistent with a structural or functional abnormality on the left.
