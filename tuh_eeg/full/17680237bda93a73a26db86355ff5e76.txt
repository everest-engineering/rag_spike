CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed female with seizures and mental retardation, who presents with 2 recent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Lipitor, Tricor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  EEG was reported during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:   F7 continuous electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm, which is at best 8 Hz and 20-75 mV amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  A small amount of frontal central beta is seen to almost none.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1, barely seen.  Hyperventilation, although attempted, not well performed by patient, reveals no abnormal discharges.  Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
