REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old man with seizures since October 11, 2012, with falls, shaking and confusion.  The patient feels they are stress related.  In addition, he has a history significant for diabetes, hypertension and depression.  His last seizure was Saturday.
MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Keppra, lisinopril, Neurontin, insulin, Ambien p.r.n., aspirin, omeprazole, oxycodone, metformin, cetirizine, clonazepam, Ativan, and Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation which produced no abnormality discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen at F7 and T3 occasionally at 2-4 Hz, amplitude at 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.
CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this EEG is different to the one seen on October 19, 2012, in which TIRDA was seen.
