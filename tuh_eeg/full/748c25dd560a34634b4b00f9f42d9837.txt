CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed male with hypertension and seizure.  The patient had a period of loss of consciousness, new onset several weeks ago.  The patient stated that he ran out of the Keppra several weeks at the time of seizure.  The patient is blind in the left eye.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Diovan, Nisoldipine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  New onset seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recording during wakefulness and sleep stage 1.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm on the left side at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  On the right side, posterior dominant rhythm is disrupted and we see background slowing on that side.  There is a normal amount of beta seen diffusely on the left side.  The patient goes into stage 1 sleep. Sharply contoured slowing at T4 was accentuated by sleep and Hyperventilation.  Activating procedures including hyperactivations and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Right frontotemporal slowing maximum at T4 with a right intermittent focal slowing with a disrupted alpha rhythm.
Sharply contoured delta slowing waves on the right central temporal and midtemporal region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right-sided intermittent focal slowing.
Right-sided disrupted alpha rhythm.
Sharply contoured delta on the right central temporal and midtemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports structural/functional processes on the right hemisphere involving gray and white matter.  Although there are sharp waves seen in this EEG, but there is sharply contoured slowly.  This is congruent with the history of adult-onset epilepsy.
