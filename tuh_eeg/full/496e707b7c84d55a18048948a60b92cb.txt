CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old woman with epilepsy.  Seizures characterized by left-sided numbness and tonic-clonic activity and tongue biting.  It began as an infant stopped and then recurred at age 20 now with 3-4 per year.  Associated with hypertension and migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Norvasc, and others
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG has the youthful appearance with a 70 microvolt 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, rhythmic central theta. This followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS in stage 2 sleep. Abundant posts were noted.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if appropriate, a more prolonged test may be considered.
