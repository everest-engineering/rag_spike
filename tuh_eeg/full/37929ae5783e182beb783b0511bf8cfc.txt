CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old right handed male for aortic root replacement.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Fentanyl, Isoflurane, Vecuronium, Solu-Medrol, Lidocaine.
INTRODUCTION:  Intraoperative digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using the intraoperative monitoring montage.  This was a 4-hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording begins with the patient in the OR.  The EEG demonstrates a relatively symmetric mixed frequency pattern with alpha frequency activity.
The anesthesia medication is adjusted and with isoflurane at 9:27, the EEG is intermittently discontinuous.  At 9:49, the EEG has started to attenuate, but shifting asymmetry is noted.  Cooling begins at 10:26.  Even prior to the cooling, the EEG intermittently attenuates with the anesthesia and the epochs of attenuation are about 10 seconds in duration or less.
Bypass of the cranium is recorded at 10:12.  The EEG is essentially suppressed at 10:24.  The cranial temperature is at 21.5, at 10:42.  The EEG is essentially flat at 10:37-10:40 with some electrode artifacts.  At 11:11, there is a burst of theta noted and circulatory arrest is obtained at 10:46.  The EEG is flat at that time.
At 11:11 notes the first cerebral activity and rewarming begins at 11:11:51 at that time.  Anesthesia is adjusted.  The patient is off the pump at 11:16.  The EEG had started to return at that time.  The surgical team "empties the heart" and EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern at 11:40 with gradual appearance of a more continuous pattern with brief attenuations and a delta pattern. The remainder of the record includes the surgical procedure.  The EEG is more or less continuous with a lower voltage mixed delta-theta pattern.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:   EEG monitoring during this aortic bypass surgery was remarkable for a burst suppression pattern noted prior to the cooling of the patient and then a suppressed EEG pattern with cooling of the head and total suppression at 10:34.  The total bypass is noted around 10:19 with loss of the EKG and then loss of the EEG which follows.
