CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory focal seizures with ocular twitching.

MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Keppra, Lamictal

INTRODUCTION:  A 2-hour digital was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient reported frequent ocular twitching and 3 spells were recorded during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with a well-organized background and a 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing an increase in amplitude of the background.
#1: During HV Ocular twitch was seen 1:45 with normal EEG


#2.Twitching of the face was noted at 2:36.  The patient reports twitching of the right eye.
No electrographic signature is accompanied with this episode.

#3: 3:21:36- patient is awake, tells the tech she feels it coming. At 3:22:00 the patient has 7.9 seconds of 6Hz right ocular twitching with artifact in the F8 Fp2 electrodes, but no discernable change in the EEG.

The patient transitions between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep during the remainder of the EEG

Heart rate 78 bpm, increasing to 90 with events, occ irregular

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG, with irregular HR

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Ocular twitching at this time did not carry an EEG signature. The third event was identical to the event  noted on 5/8/2014 This is the second EEG for this adult.  Neither EEG has demonstrated epileptiform activity, but of note, the patient's ocular twitching in the first to spells was not so marked.
