CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old woman with long psychiatric history, suicide attempt with Prozac approximately 10 days ago, previous suicide attempt with bleach ingestion.  Intermittent spells recorded over the past 4 years with confusion, headache, altered mental status.  Patient experienced 2 apparent tonic-clonic seizures on May 7th and is not interactive.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, ciprofloxacin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a generally, technically acceptable record.  The patient was somewhat responsive during the EEG, but often demonstrated tightening of facial muscles.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a 9 Hz alpha rhythm was identified in the occipital regions which was reactive to eye opening.  Abundant lambda was noted in wakefulness.  Central Mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  In relaxed, wakefulness, there is a scant amount of background theta.  There is an asymmetry in muscle with a bit more muscle noted in some regions and others.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 1 hour EEG capturing primarily wakefulness and it is remarkable for scant background theta.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Multiple normal wave forms were noted including alpha, Mu, and lambda activity.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study when the patient is able to communicate may be of value.  The presence of a normal awake pattern in an uncommunicative patient suggests that the current problem may be emotional rather than neurological.
