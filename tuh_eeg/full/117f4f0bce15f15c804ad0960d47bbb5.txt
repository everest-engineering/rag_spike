History:	72 YO MALE LAST SEEN BY FAMILY 3 DAYS BEFORE BEING FOUND DOWN.
EMS SAID PT WAS TRYING TO TALK.NO PREVIOUS HX OF SZ PMHX: DM, HLD,
Medications:	FENTANYL, MIDAZOLAM, METOPROLOL, HEPARIN, VANCOMYCIN, ZOSYN,
INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by low voltage
delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous rhythmic delta activity and attenuation faster frequencies is present in the right
hemisphere maximal in the temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right hemispheric, Maximal temporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing and attenuation faster
frequencies in the right hemisphere maximal in the temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
severe focal cortical cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is
intermittent polymorphic delta activity in the left anterior temporal region and  diffuse background
slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of focal and diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
