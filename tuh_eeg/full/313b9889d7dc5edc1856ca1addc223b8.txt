CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old right handed female, refractory epilepsy with developmental delay and CMV infection.  Seizures described as staring and dropping things from the hands.  Seizure free for the last 6 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Depo-Provera, Depakote, Levonorgestrel, raloxifene, Calcium
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient was quite restless.  Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, either a study capturing sleep or comparison with patient's childhood EEGs is suggested.
