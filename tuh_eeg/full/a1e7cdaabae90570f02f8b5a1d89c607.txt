INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal, and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Heart rate:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the excessive beta may be seen as an effect of medications like barbiturates or benzodiazepines.
