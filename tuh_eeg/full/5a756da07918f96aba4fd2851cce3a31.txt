Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to  tactile
stimuli.  HR was 66
