DATE OF STUDY:  08/15/2013 to 08/16/2013 for a total of 10 hours.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old man status post craniotomy for subdural hemorrhages presents with recurrent seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.

INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed for 10 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with one additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurse's note were used to review the EEG.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm during full wakefulness, reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some normal frontal central beta seen which improves over the  recording.  Activating procedures were not performed. Patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the left frontal region F3-C3 and at times more towards the left prefrontal region at FP1.

This is seen continuously throughout the recording.

SEIZURES:  None.

Please note that there was mild diffuse slowing at the beginning of the recording, but appears to improve within the hours of the recording.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left frontal focal slowing.

HEART RATE:  60.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left frontal region, which may be due to the known craniotomy and previous subdural.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
