REASON FOR STUDY:  Headaches.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old woman with history of multiple shunt revisions, the last one on August 30, 2012 for pseudotumor cerebri with chronic headache who presents to the hospital with complaints of severe headache for 3 days, worsening in severity with eye pain and blurred vision.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, acetaminophen, Dilaudid, Senokot.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.
The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and at times at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV. This focal slowing is seen slightly more on the left than the right.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal independent slowing (left more than right).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
