CLINICAL HISTORY: 13 year old right handed female teenager with 3 episodes of loss
of consciousness. She is amnestic for them. They begin with hyperventilation and
anxiety. Limited family history. Evaluate for seizures
MEDICATIONS: Prozac.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz, 50 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with posterior slow waves of youth. Drowsiness is
characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Deeper sleep is not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic
stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed in
this EEG. If additional information is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages
of sleep is suggested.
