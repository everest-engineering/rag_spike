CLINICAL HISTORY:   79 year old woman that presents with history of schizophrenia, diabetes, hearing loss, hypertension, GERD, anemia, with change in mental status.  She did not seem normal about 2 days ago, now nonverbal.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while being unresponsive and nonverbal.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  During the recording the patient stimulated and there is some reactivity to the record with some muscle artifact and improvement in the frequencies.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording at times with wave forms that have a triphasic appearance.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves and triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  However, in this case there may be a metabolic component to the encephalopathy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
