History:	38 year old man with a history of a prior anoxic brain injury and TBI.

Patient was uncooperative during the EEG lead placement.
Medications:	ATIVAN, DEPAKOTE, BACLOFEN, OTHERS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
