Medications:	VERSED, PROTONIX GENTAMICIN, AMLODIPINE, METOPROLOL, ZOCOR
Sedation:	Diazepam
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse  very
low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of marked diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
