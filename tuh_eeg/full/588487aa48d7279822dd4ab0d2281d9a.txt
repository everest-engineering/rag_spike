CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed female with recurrent tonic-clonic seizures, increase in seizures with "3 light seizures today as well as increasing tonic-clonic seizures."
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, also medication adherence.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was attempted using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient returned to the EEG lab.  She had removed the weave from her hair.  Impedances were good.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  There is a very subtle asymmetry with a bit of slowing in the central temporal region compared to the right both in hyperventilation and in transition to drowsiness.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep.
66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Some subtle slowing in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are quite subtle and are seen only intermittently.  This is the second EEG without epileptiform activity for this young woman
who reports recent seizures.  More prolonged EEG recording may be necessary to capture her epileptiform focus.
