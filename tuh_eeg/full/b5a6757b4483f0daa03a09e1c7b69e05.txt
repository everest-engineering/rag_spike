Medications:	BENAZEPRIL,NORVASC,CELEXA,AMBIEN,NAPROXEN1769
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 15-25uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
60  Technical difficulties: Some temporalis muscle artifact limits the evaluation to the right
frontotemporal region for a large part of the record.  There is a prominent nystagmoid artifact
towards the left during a large part of the record.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
