History:	27 year old woman with daily seizures.
Medications:	ZONISAMIDE, ALBUTEROL, CETIRIZINE, CLOBAZAM, FLUCONAZOLE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm is weak and consists of up to 7-8 Hz polymorphic low-to-moderate
amplitude theta activity.  The AP gradient is unstable.  The majority of the recording consists of
variable frequency polymorphic low amplitude theta activity.  During drowsiness, background
amplitudes increase and faster theta activity becomes more prominent.
Frequent bursts of generalized frontally predominant 3Hz low amplitude spikes with high
amplitude slow waves are captured.  They last ~ 2-4 seconds during wakefulness.  Frequency and
duration of bursts increases during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, 3Hz, frequent, increase during drowsiness
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Disorganization, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 26-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to (1) mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and disorganization and (2) frequent bursts of generalized 3 Hz spike and wave complexes
that increase in frequency during drowsiness. Diffuse slowing and disorganization are indicative of
mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Generalized
spike-and-wave discharges are potentially epileptogenic and suggestive of primary generalized
