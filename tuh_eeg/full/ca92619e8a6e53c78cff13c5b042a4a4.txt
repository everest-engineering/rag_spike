History:	52 year old woman who presents with cerebritis and recurrent seizures.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for  24 hours from 4/26/2014 till 4/27/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG
was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses
and EEG technologists.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of attenuated polymorphic diffuse delta
activity with underriding excess fast activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No seizures are noted.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Beta, excessive
Attenuation, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour continuous video EEG because of severe background slowing and
attenuation.  This finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this case at
least partially related to the medication effect.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the
