History:	74 year old woman who presents with progressive confusion that started ~ 1 month
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz alpha activity.  The AP gradient is weak.  The
background consists predominantly of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Patient remains awake
throughout the study.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Patient moves prior and during the
recording.  Therefore, the impedances are high in some of the electrodes and there is movement
artifact throughout the study.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Artifact, movement, intermittent
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild -to-moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  Due to intermittent movement artifact throughout the study, subtle focal
slowing and epileptiform discharges could have been missed.
