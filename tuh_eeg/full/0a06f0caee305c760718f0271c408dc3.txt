CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old right handed woman, with congenital hydrocephalus, status post 3 shunts with chronic dizziness, headaches.  The patient had a slip and fall episode in the bathroom with a loss of consciousness and postictal confusion, as well as headache.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has continuous eye blink.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background includes an 11 Hz 80 mV alpha rhythm.  Despite the frequent eye blind there is also some rhythmic, relatively symmetric frontal central mixed theta delta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation produces additional rhythmic frontal slowing, a little higher amplitude on the right in the region of the patient's previous craniotomy.  Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic frontal theta and delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The high amplitude prominent alpha rhythm may be accentuated by the shape of the patient's skull.  No epileptiform features were seen.
Given the magnitude of this patient's congenital brain abnormalities these findings are quite subtle.
