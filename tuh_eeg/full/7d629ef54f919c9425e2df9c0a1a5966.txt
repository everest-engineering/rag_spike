CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with depression and insomnia.
Evaluate for temporal lobe epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organizes It is relatively low voltage, but there is a well defined 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage frontal and central beta activity Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record. It produces an increase in heart rate from 72 bpm to
115 bpm. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits
vigorous driving at 5 Hz.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Photic driving is a normal phenomenon.
