History:	23yo M with a history of developmental delay and epilepsy.
Medications:	TOPAMAX, OXCARBAZEPINE, LORAZEPAM (YESTERDAY)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, lethargic, photic
Description:
At times, a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with an occasional presence of anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies. However,  the majority of the record is poorly organized.  During
drowsiness, the background attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent bursts of polymorphic delta activity is present in the bifrontal regions.  Rare, frontally
predominant, generalized 2.5 Hz spike and wave discharges were seen.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any significant changes in the background activity.  HR 120
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, slow, rare, bilateral frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  rare, frontally predominant generalized slow spike and
wave discharges. These epileptiform discharges are similar to those seen on a previous EEG and
are consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy. And  diffuse background
slowing and intermittent slowing in the frontal regions.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction and focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal
