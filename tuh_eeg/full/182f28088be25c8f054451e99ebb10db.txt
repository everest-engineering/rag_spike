CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old left handed man status post right subdural hemorrhage status post fall presents with word-finding difficulties since last week.  The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and bipolar.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Amaryl, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Protonix, Insulin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures:  Only photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which is somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is normal beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts with intermixed theta 5-7 Hz frequency while more responsive.
Focal slow waves seen continuously at C4, T4, frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Focal slowing in the right central temporal region.
2.  Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the right central temporal region which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
