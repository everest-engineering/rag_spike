Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
Patient is sedated as the recording opens.  The background is symmetrical and consists of a mixture
of polymorphic frequencies (delta, theta, alpha and beta).  Occasionally the background becomes
discontinuous or frankly burst-suppressed.  These changes are related to adjustments in anesthesia.
Left internal carotid artery is clamped at 6:55 pm and left common carotid artery is clamped ~ 25-
30 seconds later.  Within ~ 15-20 seconds of clamping the left common carotid artery, diffuse
change is seen.  It is more pronounced over the left.  This change is characterized by voltage
attenuation as well as abrupt disappearance of fast frequencies.  The attending surgeon is notified
of these changes immediately and shunt placement takes place.  Simultaneously, there is increase
in the dose of  sevoflurane and prominent diffuse delta activity appears as a result.  The primary
team is informed of these changes.  EEG returns to the pre-clamp baseline b ~ 7:06 PM.  Left
carotid artery is re-clamped at ~ 8:48 PM and EEG changes within ~ 5 seconds.  This change is
characterized by diffuse (left>right) voltage attenuation and dominance of delta activity.  EEG
change persists until ~ 8;55 PM when left internal and common carotid arteries are unclamped.
EEG gradually returns to the pre-clamp baseline.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~4 hour continuous intraoperative EEG due to global (left>right) changes
that were seen after clamp was applied to the left common and internal carotid arteries. However,
by the end of the recording, EEG appeared symmetrical and at pre-clamp baseline.  Total time of
the direct EEG monitoring by the EEG attending: ~ 2 hours.
