INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  of EKG. Photic simulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a well-organized symmetric EEG. There is alpha of 8-9 Hz throughout the record. The amplitude is mildly high for patient's age but this is nonspecific. There is some muscle artifact due to shaking episodes, however there are no EEG correlates to the shaking activity. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 	72 bpm and  regular.


IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is no epileptiform activity. There are no focal features. This study is improved compared to prior EEG.
