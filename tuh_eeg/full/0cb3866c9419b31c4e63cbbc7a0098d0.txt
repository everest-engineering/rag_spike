CLINICAL HISTORY: 	63 year old male of unknown handedness,  admitted with encephalopathy and found to  have sepsis and acute stroke.

MEDICATIONS:  Darbepoetin, Rifampin, Oxacillin


INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opens, the patient is intubated in the ICU.  He is somewhat responsive and there is a great deal of muscle artifact in the background. The background includes a mixed frequency pattern with generous 4 Hz beta, some 3 Hz delta activity, and small amounts of beta.  There is a glimpse of a theta frequency posterior dominant rhythm. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in some of the faster theta frequency activity.

HR:	78 bpm


IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Replacement of normal background
2.  Generalized slow pattern.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features are observed.  The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, as well as a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to  many different causes. No epileptiform features were seen.  These findings are nonspecific, but can be seen in a toxic or metabolism encephalopathy.
