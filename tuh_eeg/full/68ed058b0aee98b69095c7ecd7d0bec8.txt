CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old right handed woman with a history of head trauma following a motor vehicle accident.  Now she is having episodes of sleep walking.  Following the accident, she also notes that she can fall asleep even while standing.
MEDICATIONS:  Suboxone, Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 10 Hz beta.  A 13 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is noted.  Features of drowsiness include an accentuation of the beta followed by vertexes and then K complexes, spindles, and posts. The patient is falling asleep in photic stimulation and then falls asleep shortly thereafter.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient is falling asleep but still elicits a driving response.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a very sleepy patient.  The generous beta described above is a nonspecific finding which can be seen in a sleep deficit or in the context of a sleep disturbance.
