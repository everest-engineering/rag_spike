History:	64 YR MAN PRESENTED WITH RIGHT HEMIPLEGIA AND APHASIA. DIAGNOSED
WITH LEFT LENTIFORM ICH.
Medications:	Lorazepam, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, better seen over
the left hemisphere.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the
left midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In
addition there  intermittent focal slowing in the left mid temporal region.  This finding is indicative
of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
