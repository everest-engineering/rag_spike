CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old diagnosed with generalized tonic-clonic seizure on the 24th, post-ictal agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a technically satisfactory EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous frontocentral beta.  Prominent head rocking artifact was noted as the patient became drowsy.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in sleep.  In the transition in and out of sleep, there is a bit more head rocking artifact noted on the right.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing.  In hyperventilation, there were 2 broadly contoured sharp waves noted from the left, and following this, there is an additional subtle bursts from the left.
Photic stimulation elicited scant bilateral driving.  The patient was transitioned into stage 2 sleep at the end of the record with photic stimulation and then alerted briefly.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for 2 bursts of sharply contoured slowing from the left only during hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  By strict criteria, the features described above are still within the range of normal.  These findings, however, could also be seen in the localization-related epilepsy.  A repeat study in search of more well-defined epileptiform activity is suggested.
