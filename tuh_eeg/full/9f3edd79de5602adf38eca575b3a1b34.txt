CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed male with previous cholesteatoma resection, BP shunt placement, recurrent CNS infections. Evaluate for seizure October 30 while at occupational therapy with stiffening and unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS: Loratadine, Zoloft, Clonidine, Amantadine, Vancomycin, Protonix, Metoprolol, Zofran
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is relatively somnolent. There is a fair amount of artifact noted in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the artifact, there is a clear amplitude asymmetry on the left in the region of the patient's previous craniotomy. In addition, there are occasional left mid to anterior temporal high amplitude sharp waves noted. The right hemisphere demonstrates generous beta and there is mild background slowing seen intermittently, but there is a glimpse-of an alpha rhythm.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal sharp waves.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
3. Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the technical challenges described above, this EEG clearly demonstrates sharp waves. The amplitude asymmetry was seen in the first study performed in 2008.
