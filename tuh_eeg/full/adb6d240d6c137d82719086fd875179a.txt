CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old male with renal failure with an episode earlier this week with shaking, still experiencing jerking movements on May 5, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Plavix, Zosyn, ASA, Metoprolol, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow background with rhythmic theta and a small amount of alpha frequency activity.  The patient quickly drifts off into stage I sleep with vertex waves and then snore arousal.
The patient demonstrates tremulousness of the left hand.  This is not associated with an EEG correlate.  He appears to be tachypneic.  He intermittently startles, moans, and shakes his left hand.
HR:    70 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A markedly slow background.
An involuntary, intermittent behavior with something looks like a startle, moan, and hand shaking in a patient who does not appear to be awake.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, which may be metabolic or some other form of diffuse disturbance.
