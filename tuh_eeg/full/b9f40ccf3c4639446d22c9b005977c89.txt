History:	58 YR MALE WITH EPISODE WAKING UP WITH TONGUE BIT/ URINARY INCONT.
LAST WK SYNCOPE. WOKE UP ON FLOOR. NO MEMORY.  PT STATES HE
WAS DX WITH DM LAST NOV.  HE ALSO UP UNTIL LAST WK DRANK ABOUT 6
CNS BEER A NIGHT.
Medications:	Glimepiride, Metformin, Sitagliptin, Lisinopril, (EMERGENCY Glucagon kit)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is intermittent focal mid-temporal slowing maximal at T4-T6.  There are intermittent right
mid-temporal spikes maximal at T4 seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces minimal photic driving
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Spikes, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to foal mid-temporal slowing, and intermittent
right -midtemporal spikes. These findings reflect an epileptogenic focus within the right mid-
temporal region, possibly associated with a structural brain lesion.
