CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed male with epilepsy, stroke and MVA.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Diovan, Norvasc, Levetiracetam, Centrum, Amiodipine, Asa,
Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.2 hertz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. A small
á amount of age related changes including shifting temporal theta is observed.
Hyperventilation does not activate the records. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. This is
the 2nd normal EEG for this individual with epilepsy. If seizures are frequent, a more
prolonged study capturing one of his spells is suggested.
