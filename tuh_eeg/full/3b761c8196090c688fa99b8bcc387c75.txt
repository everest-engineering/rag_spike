CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old woman found down on May 13, 2012 for an unknown time period, hypoglycemic respiratory arrest, multiple medical problems, including gastric bypass, and hypertension.  The patient had positive tox screen for opiates and benzo's, no known hepatic or renal problems, perhaps anoxic insult.
MEDICATIONS:  Captopril, Lasix, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated, poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is markedly abnormal.  The primary frequencies in the background are delta with smaller amounts of theta.  It is a high amplitude, sharply contoured EEG.  There are triphasic waves noted.  Eye flutter is noted.  In addition, focal sharp waves are also observed, including in the right posterior quadrant.  There are also waves forms with focal sharps in the right frontal region, which can be differentiated from the triphasic wave, which are bilateral.  In addition, there are a handful sharp waves in the left frontal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity, but it does not alter the triphasic waves or sharp waves.  Simulation of the patient also seems produce an alerting response clinically. The overall EEG is relatively high amplitude.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due:
Markedly abnormal and slow background.
Frontally predominant triphasic waves.
Sharp waves, some of which have a periodic nature to them noted in both hemispheres, including occipital and frontal, more prominent on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a marked disturbance of cerebral function, although there are toxic and metabolic features, there are also focal epileptiform features which may represent either a bihemispheric epileptiform process or a process that has been accentuated by metabolic disturbance.
