History:	41 year old man with several months of shaking episodes.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~24  hours from ~ 6 AM on 12/20/2013 till ~ 6 am
on 12/21/2013.  Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing
raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and
changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the
attending neurologist.   The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to
screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Slow wave sleep and REM sleep are also captured.
No typical events are captured.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a normal 24-hour continuous video EEG.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
