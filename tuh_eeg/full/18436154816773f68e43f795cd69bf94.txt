History:	42 YO MALE WITH A HX OF NOCTURNAL SZ. ADMITTED TO EMU FOR
EVALUATION.
Medications:	VIMPAT, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm that reached at best reaches 7Hz.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse  delta/theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midetmporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Some infrequent sharply contoured transients are seen in the left
temporal lobe.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of diffuse background slowing, slow alpha rhythm and
left midtemporal focal slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and  focal cerebral dysfunction respectively.  Excessive beta activity
could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
