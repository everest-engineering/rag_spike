CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 60-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, who had an episode the previous day as she was starting to pull on to the highway, she felt that she did not know where she was going and had a depersonalization event.  The patient was able to drive to her destination without difficulty.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Much of this record captures drowsiness with slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of rhythmic background slowing with a single burst, which was slightly more prominent on the right.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep and elicited scant driving.  Following photic stimulation, there is a little bit of rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness, and the patient starts to drift towards stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits:  Scant driving.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The single asynchronous bursts and hyperventilation is a nonspecific finding, not considered clinically significant for an adult of this age.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
