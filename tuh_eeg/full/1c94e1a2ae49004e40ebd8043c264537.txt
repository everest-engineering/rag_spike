History:	26 year old man with a history of convulsions.  Seizures occur ~ once per year.
Medications:	Trileptal, Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  A single ~ 1 second burst of generalized frontally-maximal spike-and-
wave discharges occurring with a regular repetition rate of ~4 Hz is captured during sleep.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, one
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to a single burst of 4 Hz generalized
spike-and-wave discharges.  Background activity is otherwise normal.  These findings are consistent
with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
