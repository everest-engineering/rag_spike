History:	45 year old man who was transferred from an outside hospital due to multiple
convulsions.  Patient has a history of benzodiazepine, cocaine and alcohol abuse.
He was previously started on Dilantin but he has been non-compliant.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9-10 Hz alpha activity.  The AP gradient is
weak.  Diffuse excess theta and beta activity is captured.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is captured over the right temporal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, right temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy portable 21 minute EEG due to mild diffuse
slowing and disorganization and occasional moderate focal slowing over the right temporal region.
Diffuse slowing and disorganization are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Occasional right temporal focal slowing is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
