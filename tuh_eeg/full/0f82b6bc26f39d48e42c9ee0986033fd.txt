AGE: 71 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/20/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU 247
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep EEG #: 15-1708
HISTORY:
71 y.o. female with a history of CARDIAC ARREST, 11/14 PT HAD CABG XS OFF SEDATION. referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.
MEDICATIONS:
LASIX, ALBUTEROL, METOPROLOL, HEPARIN, NYSTATIN, INSULIN, FAMOTIDINE, ASA, SEROQUEL, PRAVASTATIN, LIDOCAINE, VERSED (11/20 4:20AM 2MG)
TECHNIQUE:
A bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
This is a dynamic record . It includes a continuous pattern. When the patient is stimulated, there is a 6 Hz, theta pattern which is reactive.	When the patient is unstimulated, the EEG
transitions to an irregular, slow delta pattern with intermittent attenuation. Attenuation is brief lasting 1-2 seconds.
No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Tactile stimulation produces alerting response with increased and faster frequency activity.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events capturedÂ·during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 120 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal bedside portable EEG
generalized background slowing
intermittent attenuation of the background
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbances or function.	This is a dynamic pattern.	The patient is clearly responsive to external stimuli.	These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or encephalopathy due to other causes
No epileptiform features were seen.	This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
