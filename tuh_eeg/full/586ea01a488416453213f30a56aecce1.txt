CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old right handed female with episodes of lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, and sort of feeling drained.  Last episode on March 12, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Patient cannot recall.
REASON FOR SEIZURES:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal electrode and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta at times seem more diffusely than usual.
Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 and at times at T3 occasionally throughout the recording.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3-T1 seen very frequently throughout the recording and at times this slowing appears to be rhythmic and monomorphic and is consistent with temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal sharp waves and slow waves in the left anterior temporal region.
TIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In
addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the same region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
