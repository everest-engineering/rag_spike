CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old right-handed woman with Crohn disease.  The patient had a loss of consciousness, fell down the stairs, and was found to have C7 lamina fracture and L1 fracture.  Past history of prior assault 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Toradol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilos Ohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  The patient seems to be extremely drowsy and also demonstrates intermittent itching or scratching.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes almost exclusively stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Of note, with arousal, there are some points where the patient seems to be behaviorally active, but demonstrates rhythmic slowing.  On brief occasions, a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm is noted with wakefulness.
Heart rate 75 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for intermittent generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG does include normal wakefulness and sleep in the intermittent, paroxysmal slowing may represent medication affect.
