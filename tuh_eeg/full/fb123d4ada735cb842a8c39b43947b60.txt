History: 32-year-old man presents with episode of "blackout and fall" on a weekly basis since May 2013.
Medications:
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric steep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.. HR is 70 bpm.

Summary of Findings:
Normal EEG

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG. awake, drowsy, and asleep.
