CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old male with anoxic encephalopathy,  status post code
September 29.

MEDICATIONS:  ASA, Zocor, Plavix, Moxifloxacin, Vanco, isosorbide, Protonix, Valproic, Captopril, Metoprolol,  Heparin

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated.  He continues to have some muscle artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, slow, relatively featureless mixture of delta and theta.  There is some muscle artifact in the record and a suggestion of asymmetry with a bit more slowing in the right in comparison to the left.  Spontaneous  eye movement artifact is observed.

HR: 	96 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.

CLINICAL CORR ELATION:  This EEG supports a significant bihemispheric  disturbance of cerebral function.  These findings should be regarded in the context of this patient's other current medical problems.  No epileptiform features were noted today.
