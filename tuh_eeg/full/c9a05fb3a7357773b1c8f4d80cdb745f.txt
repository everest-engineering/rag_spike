CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed female with childhood epilepsy, previously seizure-free since 2000 but now with Increasing auras and seizures during this pregnancy. After she reduced her Tegretol dose.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Levothyroxine.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient reports that she has not experienced a seizure in 3 days and feels normal on the day in question.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is an abnormality in the record with a repetitive spike or sharp wave in the right occipital region. This is seen almost at 3 to 5 Hz in frequency. It averages a little more than 3 Hz with a peak of 70 microvolts in the background. This accompanies primarily alpha and theta frequency background with a suggestion of an alpha rhythm on the left of approximately 7.3 Hz, but there is also some 8.5 Hz activity in the background noted. The occipital spiking Is nearly continuous throughout the record. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. The right occipital 02 spike waxes and wanes. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving on the left and does not seem to impact the right occipital spiking. At the end of photic stimulation, however, the spiking seems to be slowing to below 3 Hz.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous right occipital spike activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were discussed with the patient. This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the right occipital cortex.
