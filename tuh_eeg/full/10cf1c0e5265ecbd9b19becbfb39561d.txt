CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old man with onset seizures, prior status, found to have a right cerebellar and left MCA CVA in addition to CHF and cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, A-fib with pacer, hypertension, OSA.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lisinopril, Coreg, Digoxin, Lasix, Aldactone, Coumadin, Allopurinol, Colchicine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an alpha rhythm with a 9.5 hertz and with some right temporal slowing and in addition to more beta frequency on the left side. Features of drowsiness are vertex wave and K complex in addition to some left sided attenuation, more prominent when the patient enters drowsiness.
HR: 66 and irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left side with some disruption of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings of the focal slowing and the disruption of the alpha rhythm are suggestive of a pathology involving gray matter, however, the features in this study have improved compared to the prior EEGs. No epileptiform activity was observed in this record.
