CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed male who had a syncopal event
January 30 after not eating for 3 days.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
.system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz, 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Prominent eye movement
artifact is noted throughout the record. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features identified in this record.
A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important
consideration, additional testing may be valuable.
