REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69-year-old man with a history of a gunshot wound to the right side of the head in 1957 who has been seizure-free for over 20 years, who comes for evaluation of bilateral lung transplant.
MEDICATIONS:  No antiepileptic medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures included  photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72 and regular.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, but this is seen best over the left hemisphere.  There is frontocentral beta seen slightly better over the left and the right hemisphere.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient did go into sleep stage I and stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously at T6 at a frequency of 5-7 Hz.  At times slightly slower at 2-4 Hz with a high amplitude consistent with a breach rhythm in that region Please note that there is also at times an absence of faster frequencies over the T6 region.
There is also slow waves seen intermittently at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right posterior temporal continuous slowing and an absence of faster frequencies as well as intermittent right anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right posterior temporal region, which is consistent with the  known gunshot wound.  In addition, there is some evidence of right anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
