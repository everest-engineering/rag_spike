CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 40-year-old woman with adult onset epilepsy and anxiety disorder, recent hospitalization for repetitive seizures from the right temporal region.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The recording began when the patient was drowsy but she was able to follow commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with more of a theta pattern.  In addition, there is intermittent focal slowing from the right mid to posterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, as well as accentuating the focal slowing.  The patient transitions into stage 2 sleep with spindles.  In stage 2 sleep, there is some shifting slowing in the temporal regions.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
A pattern of rhythmic background slowing.
Superimposed arrhythmic slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal region.
A handful of shifting bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The marked background slowing is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in a postictal state but does support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  In comparison to previous EEGs, less epileptiform activity was noted.  The
focal slowing in the right temporal region is ipsilateral to the previous epileptiform activity.
