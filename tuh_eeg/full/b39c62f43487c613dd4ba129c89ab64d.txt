CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old right handed woman with a 5 mm left anterior choroidal artery aneurysm.
MEDICATIONS:  Anesthetic medications: Fentanyl. Heparin, Lidocaine, Rocuronium
INTRODUCTION:  Two-hour thirty-minute EEG was performed in the angiography suite using standard CEA montage. 1 channel EKG. 10-20 system of electrode placement.  This EEG monitoring included 1 hour 45 minutes remote review by physician, 1 on 1, 15 minutes physician review in the suite and 30 minutes physician remote review during 2 simultaneous cases.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake with symmetric reactive background.  At 2:08, the patient received increasing doses of anesthetic medications, with an increase in fast activity.  The EEG is 3 field lead, discontinuous by 2:21.  As was noted in previous cases, this EEG demonstrates a little bit more posteriorly predominant slowing.
The EEG waxes and wanes, congruent with fluctuations at level of anesthesia, and these findings were reported to the operative team.
Heparin was given at 3:04, and the catheter was placed in the left carotid.  The coils were launched at 3:21-3:47.  Although the EEG demonstrated some waxing and waning, congruent with anesthesia, no focal features were noted.  As the procedure was completed and the surgical team was finishing, the anesthetic medications had been adjusted and the EEG was a bit more discontinuous at 4:35 and these findings were reported to the team and the medications were again adjusted.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  intraoperative  monitoring demonstrated no significant focal features with placement of the coils..
