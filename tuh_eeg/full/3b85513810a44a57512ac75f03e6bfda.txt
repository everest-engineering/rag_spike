MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Lovenox, Levothyroxine, Trileptal, ASA, Effexor, Dilantin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a symmetric 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Features of drowsiness include slowing of the alpha rhythm and the appearance is some temporal theta activity. Stage 2 sleep includes abundant POSTS, vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles. The patient has some eye movements in stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits an abundant driving response.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
