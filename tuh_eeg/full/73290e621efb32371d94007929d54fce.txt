History:	73 year old male with recent status epilepticus, now resolved.
Medications:	Dilantin, Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
For much of the recording, there is no posterior dominant rhythm was present. However, during brief
stages of maximal arousal, there is a 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is reactive to eye
opening.  Much of the background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Throughout
much of the day, there is Stage I and II sleep seen intermittently. At night, after 11PM, additional
deeper stages of sleep are seen.
No focal slowing is present.  There are rare left mid-temporal sharp waves seen, maximal at F7-T3.
There were two electrographic seizures seen emanating from the left hemisphere at 12:53:57 and
3.23:35PM.  These last 60-90 seconds and resolve spontaneously. There is no obvious clinical
correlate to these events.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral diffuse
Seizure, two, left hemispheric
Sharp waves, rare, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm, left frontotemporal sharp waves, and two left hemisphere electrographic seizures.  These
findings suggest a structural brain lesion with epileptiform potential and recurrent electrographic
seizures.  Diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm suggest moderate brain dysfunction.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
