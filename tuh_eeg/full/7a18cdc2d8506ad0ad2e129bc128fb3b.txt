History:	29 YR FEMALE WITH ANOXIC  BRAIN INJ 2012, PEG AND TRACH, SZS, HTN,
ENCEPHALOPATHY  PT WITH MANY SORES BACK HEAD, EARS ( HOLES)
BODY. PT PRESENTED FROM LTC FACILITY WITH FEVER 104
Medications:	Valproate, Zosyn, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and at times theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient
of frequencies.  There were intermittent attenuation and discontinuity of the background when the
patient is not stimulated.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional bifrontal sharp waves were noted with no evolution.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity in background
activity to tactile stimulus.  HR was 110 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization
Discontinuous background, intermittent
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Low voltage
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and intermittent attenuation.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
occasional bifrontal epileptiform discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Clinical
