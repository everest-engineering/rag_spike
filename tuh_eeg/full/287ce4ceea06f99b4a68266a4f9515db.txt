History:	59 year old woman with a history of a head injury in 02/2015 with subsequent
various symptoms.
Medications:	Paxil, Elavil, neurontin, lidocaine and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient transitions to sleep very rapidly and is asleep
throughout most of the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2, extensive
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and mostly asleep. Patient transitions to sleep
very rapidly and is asleep throughout most of the recording - please correlate clinically with an
underlying sleep disorder.
