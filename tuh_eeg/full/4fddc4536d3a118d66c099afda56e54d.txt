MEDICATION:  Keppra.
HISTORY:  A 52-year-old man with history of seizures with jerking and loss of consciousness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hypoventilation, photic stimulation and produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormality Discharges:  None.
Heart rate:  84.  Please note that there is frequent premature ventricular complexes seen throughout the recording almost every other heartbeat.
