CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old female with epilepsy, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, carotid disease, amaurosis fugax and giant cell arteritis.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax and others
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10Â·20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a interhemispheric
asymmetry. The left hemisphere is reasonably well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm. The right hemisphere demonstrates significant focal slowing particularly in the right posterior quadrant with disruption of the alpha rhythm and rhythmic 22 hertz delta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in wakefulness. Photic stimulation is obscured by muscle artifact.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
2. Disruption of the alpha rhythm in that same region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing noted in this EEG is congruent with the
past history of stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. No epileptiform features were noted today.
