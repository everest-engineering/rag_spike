CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy for many years, at times, seizure free.  Profound psychiatric pathology, now with increasing seizures every day and seizure prior to this EEG recording.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra, and Lacosamide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was drowsy.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This is a technically acceptable EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG demonstrates an arrhythmic delta activity and prominent sharp waves and spikes noted from the left.  Intermittent sharp waves and spikes were noted from the right and as the recording continues, epileptiform activity with high amplitude sharp waves or spikes can be noted from either region with maximum in the anterior temporal regions or mid temporal regions.  Prominent beta activity is noted.
By the end of the recording, with an arousal there is a brief glimpse of a theta frequency or posterior dominant rhythm, but prominent beta.
HEART RATE 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Independent, right or left temporal sharp waves.
Superimposed focal slowing on the left.
Prominent beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a history of bilateral CNS pathology, the epileptiform activity can be correlated with this patient's MRI findings.  No seizures were recorded.  The background slowing as well as the generous beta and focal features may be part of the post ictal pattern.  Long-term EEG monitoring will follow this routine study to monitor for seizures safety and characterize additional seizures.
