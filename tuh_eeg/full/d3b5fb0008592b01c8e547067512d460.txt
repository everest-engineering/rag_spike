CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old male nursing home resident with tonic/clonic
seizures beginning 2 months ago.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zyprexa, Klonopin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient Is awake with frequent
eye blink.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an awake
individual with a low-voltage beta pattern and continuous eye-blink artifact. Although
the patient seems to become drowsy during the record, he continues to demonstrate
continuous eye blink. Photic stimulation does seem to elicit a driving response, although
this is difficult to distinguish from the background beta.

HR: 110 bpm.

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for a pattern of nearly continuous beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: On just 1 occasion the patient seems to be able to relax
enough to demonstrate a well-defined alpha rhythm. Because of this, it is possible that
should this patient's behavioral issues be overcome it would be possible to obtain a
good wakefulness through stage II sleep record. Please consider a followup EEG when
the patient is a bit more cooperative or able to cooperate with the testing so that we
could evaluate wakefulness through stage II sleep. Possibilities include a sleep
deprived study or just a more prolonged 1-hour EEG when the patient is able to do so.
