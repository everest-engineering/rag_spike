CLINICAL HISTORY:  80 year old right handed male with a past medical history of COPD, lung cancer, positive PPD, ulcers, BPH, glaucoma, hypertension, GERD, hyperlipidemia, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Flomax, Pravastatin, Aspirin, Levetiracetam, Amlodipine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is an increased bilateral, but right more than left, temporalis muscle artifact throughout the recording.  The patient did not relax.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness.  As stated above, there is an increased amount of temporalis artifact and blinking, and the patient does not fall asleep.  The activating procedure of photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.  Please note that if epilepsy remains a consideration, capturing deeper stages of sleep would aid in confirming the diagnosis.
