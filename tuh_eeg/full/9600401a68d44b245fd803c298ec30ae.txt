CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old male with known retardation, heart failure, and MCA, ? recent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Dilantin, Ativan, Haldol, Hydralazine, Lisinopril, ASA, Spironolactone  , Isosorbide, Protonix
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  The patient is somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is somnolent throughout.  There is generous beta.  In this slow background, there is an asymmetry with more attenuated slow activity noted in the right compared to the left.  The left hemisphere is somewhat richer in beta activity.  There is a transition to stage II sleep with spindle activity identified bilaterally, as well as vertex waves.  POSTs are also noted. Over the course of the EEG the background in richer in faster frequency activity, particularly in the frontal regions.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing, improving somewhat over time.
An asymmetry with somewhat attenuated activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is a nonspecific process and may be due to postictal state, medications, or this patient's bihemispheric pathology.  No epileptiform features were noted.  A pattern of improvement over time can be seen in a postictal patient who suffered recent exacerbation of seizures.
