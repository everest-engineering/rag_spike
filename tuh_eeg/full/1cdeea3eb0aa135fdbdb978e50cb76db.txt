CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, right parietal infarct, found down for 1 day with intermittent twitching of the left hemibody with variability in the morphology of the twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, phenytoin, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was drowsy, but easily arousable during the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly asymmetric pattern.  From the left hemisphere, at times, the patient is awake with 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In wakefulness and drowsiness, the right hemisphere demonstrates a periodic, PLED-plus like pattern with a periodic sharp wave with variable maximum including C4 or P4.  There is some faster frequency activity that follows this.  There is subtle buildup of the activity.
No clinical seizures,  jerking or involuntary movements were noted in this 20-minute EEG.
Heart rate 90, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A periodic activity in the right hemisphere.
Right focal slowing with disruption of faster activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a highly irritative EEG for a patient who has had recent, focal motor involuntary movements.  Additional more prolonged EEG recording will follow this study.
