CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted with change in mental status and myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Thiamine, Pantoprazole, Rifaximin, Folic Acid, Synthroid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was described as having bizarre behavior during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is significantly obscured by muscle, but there is an underlying posterior dominant rhythm, which reaches 5 Hz. True artifact is observed. With the use of a filter, there is more theta frequency identifiable, but the alpha consistently remains below 8 Hz. As the patient becomes drowsy, frontal delta was noted. Photic stimulation elicited both a driving response and photomyogenic artifact.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The slow background and the frontal delta can both be seen in context of a metabolic encephalopathy.
