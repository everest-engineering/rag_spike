TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient is moving continuously throughout the recording, and there is a lot of muscle artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of theta.  The patient is recorded while awake.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges which included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
HR:   66, at times with multiple frequent PVCs.
