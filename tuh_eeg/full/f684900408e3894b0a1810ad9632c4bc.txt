CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old woman with a history of memory loss, forgets where she is, what she is doing for minutes for the past year.  Also history of depression, anxiety and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Xanax, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen independently at F7/T3 occasionally and rarely at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mcV.
Heart rate 66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing over the left anterior temporal region as well as the right mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region as well as independently over the right mid temporal region, both of which are not specific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
