CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with bipolar disease, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, admitted with change in mental status, loss of consciousness, and shaking.-
MEDICATIONS:  ASA, no sedatives
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  The patient was experiencing a cough.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient drifts off to sleep with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and then POSTS.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.  The patient has intermittent arousals from coughing.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting into stage 2 sleep but minimal driving was noted.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Electroencephalogram within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study may be valuable.
