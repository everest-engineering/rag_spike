DATE OF STUDY:  March 5, 2013, through March 6, 2013
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 75-year-old woman admitted with right-sided weakness and right-sided facial droop.  The patient has been in a nursing home for 6 years. During her baseline EEG she had an episode of unresponsiveness with a serum glucose of 40.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, gabapentin, metoprolol, atorvastatin.
ROOM NUMBER:  878A
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was initiated using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.
During this recording, the patient had no clinical seizures.  Reviewing the video, she seems to have some tremulousness of the mouth.  No clinical events were noted, but passive movement on the right arm produced tremor.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During sections of the record when the patient has tremulousness, the EEG is obscured by low-voltage muscle artifact.  When the tremor decreases, the patient appears to be unresponsive with a very low-voltage slow pattern and a bit more sharply contoured delta in the right hemisphere in the central temporal region.  Tactile stimulation of the patient does not produce an alerting response or an arousal, and an increase in muscle artifact as might be anticipated in a patient with significant spasticity.
Heart rate 72-84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal video EEG monitoring session due to:
Absence of the normal waveforms of wakefulness and sleep.
A markedly slow background.
Some sharply contoured slowing in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  There is a bit more focal slowing on the right, congruent with a larger right MC infarct.  No seizures were recorded.  No interictal epileptiform features were identified.  The patient's motor behaviors were not associated with an EEG signature.
