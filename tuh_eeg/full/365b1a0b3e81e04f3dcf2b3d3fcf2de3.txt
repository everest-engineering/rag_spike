History:	70 year old woman who presents with an episode concerning for a seizure.  Patient
has a history of stage VI breast cancer.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan (for MRI) and fentanyl (for MRI)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal the background consists of polymorphic 9-10 Hz alpha activity with
expected AP gradient.  Superimposed diffuse slow delta activity is present.  Patient rapidly
transitions to sleep.  Symmetrical sleep spindles are captured.
Subtle voltage attenuation and paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the right posterior
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
results in better photic response over the left.
Summary of Findings:
Other, asymmetry in photic response, better left
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right posterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 26-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, subtle focal
right posterior quadrant focal slowing and asymmetric photic response with better response over the
left. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and lesser photic response over the right posterior quadrant
indicate a focal structural lesion in this region.
