CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman, who fell, struck her head and had a single, contact convulsion.  Continues to have constant dizziness and left posterior headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Zoloft, Neurontin, and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is abundant beta frequency activity.  A posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 is noted, but there seems to be an alpha harmonic.  Features of drowsiness include the appearance of wicket, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and a more diffuse distribution of the beta activity.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  A single artifactual burst of head rocking artifact was noted on the right.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Multiple normal variants including an alpha harmonic were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be a value.
