History:	60 year old man with a history of seizures, reportedly with no seizures for the last 12
years.
Medications:	DILANTIN, ELAVIL, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mild-to-moderate
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to intermittent mild-to-moderate focal
left temporal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG
does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Diffuse excess beta could be secondary to the
medication effect, either benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
