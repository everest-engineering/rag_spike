History:	35 yr male with onset of seizures in 2/12.   Patient continues to have seizures.  He
also reports some memory difficulties.
Medications:	Carbamazepine
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  BETS (benign epileptiform transients
of sleep) or SSS (small sharp spikes) are seen during drowsiness.
Rare polymorphic theta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
BETS (benign epileptiform transients of sleep) or SSS (small sharp spikes)
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, marked, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to rare mild left anterior temporal
focal slowing. This finding is indicative of possible focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
