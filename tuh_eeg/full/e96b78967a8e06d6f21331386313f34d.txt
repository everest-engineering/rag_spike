CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male admitted January 31 with anoxic brain injury, now with an episode with eyes rolling back in his head and increasing blood pressure.
MEDICATIONS:  Midazolam, Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Flagyl, Gentamicin, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous but markedly abnormal pattern.  It is a mixed frequency pattern rich in slow delta, some theta, and occasional frontal beta.  There are some asymmetries noted in the record with a bit more slow delta in the right posterior quadrant than the left.  There is also some shifting slow delta that is sometimes a little bit more pervasive in the right hemisphere.  Other sections of the record are more consistently symmetric.  There is a small degree of variability in the record, with some sections demonstrating a bit more theta and beta.  In addition, this EEG demonstrates rare attenuation of the background followed by bursts of bilateral frontal delta.   Tactile stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:    150 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
A bit more slow delta on the right.
A paroxysmal pattern with attenuation and then bursts of delta.
Absence of reactivity, although there is some variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  No seizures were recorded.  There are features about this EEG which may reflect either a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function or a metabolic disturbance including the attenuation and FIRDA.  Alternatively, this may reflect a more chronic, postanoxic pattern.
