CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old male found without a pulse on May 17, required relatively vigorous and prolonged resuscitation, now with myoclonic jerks and possible concomitant drug overdose.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lorazepam, Heparin, Famotidine, Vancomycin, Propofol, Midazolam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated, in a hard collar, and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a low voltage EEG.  There is significant, low voltage 13 Hz beta.  There is a small amount of 9 Hz alpha frequency activity and then low voltage delta.  Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:    130 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A relatively invariant pattern with low voltage beta and smaller amounts of alpha and delta frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  To put this EEG in a proper clinical context, it is essential to know that the patient's medications and tox screen results, benzodiazepine overdose,
as well as the use of benzodiazepines can also contribute to the pattern described above, or the use of sedative medications.
