History:	82 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF DECREASED RESP.  PT HAD SIMILAR EPISODES
BEFORE.  R/O SZ
Medications:	lovenox, ceftriaxone, insulin, levothyroxine, lipitor
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 54
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
