LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 59-year-old man who presents with a single episode of blacking out while drinking on 01/04/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Hypertensive medications, but the patient does not recall their names.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Normal stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
