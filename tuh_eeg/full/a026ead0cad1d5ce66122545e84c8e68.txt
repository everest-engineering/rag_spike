CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old female with a history of right-sided weakness, stroke, status post thrombolysis.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow background with 7 Hz alpha rhythm and excess background theta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Stimulation of the patient does produce an increase in faster frequency activity. Heart rate 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild bilateral background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. No epileptiform features were observed.
