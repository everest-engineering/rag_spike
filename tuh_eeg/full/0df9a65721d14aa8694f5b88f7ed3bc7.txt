CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old male with recurrent dizziness, loss of consciousness, recurrent syncope, COPD, CAD, DJD, HCV, prostate cancer, and polysubstance abuse as well as prior stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient seem to be somewhat agitated and there is significant muscle and movement artifact in this bedside recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with rhythmic 5 Hz activity.  Given the limitations of this record, there is no clearly defined posterior dominant rhythm in this awake, agitated patient.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in this record.  The features described above are nonspecific and support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  If epilepsy or focal features are an important question, a followup study when the patient is able to cooperate is suggested.
