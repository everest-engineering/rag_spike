INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode as well as anterior temporal electrodes. Awake, lethargic and stage I sleep were recorded. Photic stimulation was performed. No hyperventilation was performed.
MEDICATIONS: Include aspirin and heparin.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: None.
HISTORY: An 82-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and right frontotemporal meningioma who presents with confusion and drooling as well as agitation, status post getting 1 mg of Ativan.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens up to a diffusely slow EEG background in the theta frequencies 5 to 8 Hz and 20 to 70 microvolts amplitude. The posterior dominant rhythm at best reaches 7 Hz and appears to be reactive to eye opening. A small amount
of frontocentral beta seen. As the patient appears to drowse off into sleep, some vertex complexes are seen. Infrequent small spikes are seen at F8 with a negative field in the right temporal lobe with some positivity in the left temporal lobe and a low amplitude below 50 microvolts also know as benign epileptiform transient of sleep (BETS). During photic stimulation, no abnormal discharges were seen. The heart rate was around 60.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves at 5 to 8 Hz and 20 to 70 microvolts.
2. Bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA) were seen during the short wakefulness.
SEIZURES: None.
s
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to generalized slow waves and FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures were
seen.
