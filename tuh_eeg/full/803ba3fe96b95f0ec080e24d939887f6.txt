CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed male with left facial twitching for the last week.  Also twitching in the eye.  These symptoms may prohibit him from speaking clearly.  Past history of alcohol and cocaine abuse as well as pneumothorax.
MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, Keppra, B 12, Folate Acid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5-Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  It achieves a voltage of 70 microvolts.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta.  The overall background demonstrates generous beta.  In stage 2 sleep, there are POSTS and spindles.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta is a normal finding.  No seizures or unusual behaviors were noted during the EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing one of his spells is suggested.
