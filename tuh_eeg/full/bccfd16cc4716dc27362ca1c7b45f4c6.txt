DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 hertz rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient is very drowsy and drifts back into sleep with vertex waves and posts. K complexes are noted. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II and does not activate the record.
