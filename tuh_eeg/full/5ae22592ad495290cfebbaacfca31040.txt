CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed male with complex partial epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tramadol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation Is performed
but there is no hyperventilation. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.8 Hertz alpha rhythm
identified better on the left than the right There is subtle arrhythmic delta activity in the right mid to posterior temporal region and disruption of faster frequency activity on the right. As the patient becomes drowsy there is an increase in beta and an increase in
rhythmic slowing from the right temporal region. Other features of sleep include vertex
waves and intermittent rhythmic generalized theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving
response more developed on the left compared to the right.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous EEGs, this EEG demonstrated
no epileptiform activity and that focal features from the right temporal region were not as prominent. The characteristics of this patients focal slowing are typical of that seen in a structural process involving gray and white matter.
