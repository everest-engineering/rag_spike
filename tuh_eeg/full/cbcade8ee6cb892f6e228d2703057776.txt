CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old woman presenting with a history of right femoral popliteal bypass and an ankle debridement.  Post operation the patient was complicated with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypertension and eventually intubated and admitted to the hospital secondary to shortness of breath and respiratory failure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Flagyl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 anterior temporal electrode and 1 EKG electrode.  Wakefulness was recorded.  No stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  There was some EKG lead artifact during the procedure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffused slow background of 1-2 Hz and 20-60 mV. No normal PDR or frontocentral beta is seen
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES::
Diffuse slowing at 1-2 Hz with 20-60 mV.
Focal slowing in F4/C4 at 2-4 Hz and 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves on the right frontal central.
Diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG showed focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the right frontal central region, which is consistent with the recent stroke.  This EEG also shows evidence  of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
