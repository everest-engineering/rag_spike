CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right-handed female with past history of epilepsy, bipolar disease, now with generalized weakness, abdominal pain, and starting spells.

MEDICATIONS: Protonix, amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, diazepam, depakote, Zoloft, Lovenox, Tylenol, Percocet, Ceftriaxone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is not performed, but photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of excess beta and theta. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess beta and theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The excess beta and theta may be associated with medications used to treat this patient's other medical conditions. If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow-up study may be considered.
