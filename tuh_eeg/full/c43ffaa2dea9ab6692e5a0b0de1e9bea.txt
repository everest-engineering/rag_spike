CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old left handed woman with recent, right hemispheric stroke, left-sided weakness and right MCA stenosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Fentanyl, Isoflurane, Vecuronium, Heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Tracing begins with the patient initially awake with a briefly posterior dominant rhythm.  With the administration of sedative hypnotic medications, there was an increase fast activity as well as some bursts of frontal delta and some head rocking activity.  As the recording continues, a subtle asymmetry is identified with the use of Isoflurane, propofol and fentanyl.  Subtle asymmetry particularly in the posterior regions with a bit more attenuation on the right in comparison to the left.  It is a little bit more notable at 2:52.
The carotid was clamped at 3:22.  No significant, additional focal changes are noted.
As the procedure continues, and the level of anesthesia is reduced, the record is increasingly continuous with increasing richness and faster frequency activity, and the asymmetry resolves.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this right carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for a subtle asymmetry on the right with the use of anesthesia, but no additional focal changes with placement of the clamp.
