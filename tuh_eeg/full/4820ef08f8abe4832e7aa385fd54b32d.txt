REASON FOR STUDY:  Concern for seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 26-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, found down for over 4 hours with alcohol use and ruptured ACOM aneurysm now with a ventriculostomy and intubated.

MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes for a total of 2 hours.  The patient was recorded minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, there is a diffuse slowing with asymmetric amplitude and almost suppression of the right hemisphere and focal slowing in the left hemisphere.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slowing, focal attenuation of the right hemisphere.
2. Focal slowing of the left hemisphere maximal at T3.
3. Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right hemispheric suppression as well as left mid temporal continued focal slowing and generalized slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction of the gray matter over the left hemisphere, which is consistent with a known lesion over that region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction over the left hemisphere maximal in the mid-temporal region, which has a clinical correlation with a structural lesion over that region.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
