CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 32-year-old, right-handed woman with a right basal ganglia lacune and a one-year history of intermittent episodes of left-sided numbness and tingling with alteration in speech and/or bilateral tingling. History of non-insulin dependent diabetes and asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient did not report any clinical events, and none were detected by the nurses or the computer.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.  Generous sleep was recorded, but it is primarily stage II sleep with vigorous K complexes, spindles, and vertex waves.  High amplitude POSTS were identified.  Deeper stages of sleep were not identified.
HR: 90 BPM.
