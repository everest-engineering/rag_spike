History:	72 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS FOR RE-DO OF AVR
Medications:	Induction meds, Ketamine, Fentanyl, Ve
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes
Description:
Upon opening there is a waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  As the patient is sedated the  background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular 4-7Hz activity with intermittent attenuation. This background remains until the end of the study.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66, stopped for about 45
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful 2 hour EEG during aortic valve replacement surgery.
