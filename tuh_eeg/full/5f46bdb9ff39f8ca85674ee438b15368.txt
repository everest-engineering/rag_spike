MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Topamax, calcium, others.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 50-year-old male, status post aneurysm clipping in approximately 1987-88, seizure free for many years, but now with intermittent spells in which he is perhaps inattentive to his mother, and then tells her that he is all right.  Bilateral encephalomalacia.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically unsatisfactory EEG with most impedances below 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  This was a 40-minute EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is very low voltage, and at times almost featureless.  Much of the recording was at a sensitivity of 3.  The overall background includes a mixture of theta and beta.  Artifacts due to the deformity of the patient's scalp on the left were noted and a breach rhythm with an increase in amplitude of theta on the left was observed.

Photic stimulation elicited questionable supra-harmonic driving.

Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background and slightly accentuated the rhythmic slowing on the left frontal region.

Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in the rhythmic slowing in the left frontocentral region and an increase in beta.  Muscle artifact was noted throughout the record.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to,
1. Low voltage pattern.
2. Generalized background slowing.
3. In the context of a breach rhythm, left rhythmic frontal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  The last 3 EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  If additional information is needed, consideration for an alternative monitoring strategy may be appropriate.
