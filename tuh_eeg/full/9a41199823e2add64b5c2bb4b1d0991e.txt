History:	50 YO F WITH CC OF NONEPILEPTIC SZ PMHX: DM, HTN,
ASTHMA, GERD, OSA (CPAP), HLD, DEPRESSION.
Medications:	Neurontin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep
