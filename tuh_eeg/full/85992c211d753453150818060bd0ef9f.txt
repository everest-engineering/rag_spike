History:	PT PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ DISORDER SINCE CHILDHOOD. LAST SZ ACTIVITY MONTHS AGO PT VAGUE W/HISTORY, SZ W/LOC AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION.*10/13/2014* FOLLOW UP EEG. PT SAID "LAST SZ A FEW MONTHS BACK".
Medications:	DILANTIN, KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 72
Technical difficulties: There was almost continuous myogenic artifact over the temporal regions.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation: This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
