REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of black-outs, possible seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone, Neurontin, Synthroid, and Risperdal.
HISTORY:  A 43-year-old woman with episodes of loss of time, black-outs, confusion, past medical history of drug abuse and migraines.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reaches at best in a limited amount of time, a posterior dominant rhythm that gets to 9 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  However, there is a lack of normal frontal central beta, and the overall background consists of theta frequency discharge at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.  The patient does appear to go to sleep, stage I, but no deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
