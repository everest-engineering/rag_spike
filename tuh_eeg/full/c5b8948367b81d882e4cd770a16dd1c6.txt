CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed gentleman with oligodendroglioma and seizures in July. Treated intermittently with Keppra.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

.DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm present bilaterally. In related wakefulness and prominent in drowsiness, there is a prominent breach rhythm particularly in the left frontocentral region with accentuation of beta in that region. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces focal slowing in the left frontocentral frontotemporal region. Features of stage 1 sleep include an increase in beta with brief vertex waves. The focal slowing is more prominent in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left frontocentral focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The left frontocentral focal slowing and breach rhythm
may be correlated with imaging. No epileptiform features were noted. These are relatively anticipated findings following craniotomy.
