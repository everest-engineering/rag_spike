CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old woman with a history of staring spells, sometimes falls, not responding.  She feels dizzy and out of it approximately once every month.
MEDICATIONS:  None
REASON FOR STUDY:  Staring spells.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal and right central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen at 01 intermittently at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild intermittent focal slowing in the left occipital region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left occipital region, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
