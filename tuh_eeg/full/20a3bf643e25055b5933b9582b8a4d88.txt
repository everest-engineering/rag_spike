History:	21 YR OLD FEMALE WTH  PMHX OF MR ASTHMA AND SEIZURES.
Medications:	TOPAMAX
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Intermittent symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is
also seen.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
