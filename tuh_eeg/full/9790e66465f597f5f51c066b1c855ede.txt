History:	62 YR OLD FEMALE WITH H/O RE-ADMIT FOR ALTERED MENTAL STATUS AND
FREQ EPISODES OF HYPOTENSION AND HYPOTHERMIA. LAST ADMIT /DC'D ON
2/25 HX OF GI BLEED, RENAL FAILURE, ANOXIA, SEPSIS, C-DIFF, S/P CODE.
Medications:	Keppra, Vecuronium given.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 03/10/14 to03/11/14.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is an intermittent rhythmic
diffuse discharge that subsided with vecuronium which indicates that this is a myogenic artifact..
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Triphasic waves
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
