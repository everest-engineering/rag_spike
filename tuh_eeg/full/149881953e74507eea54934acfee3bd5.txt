History:	63 year old woman with an episode of slurred speech and confusion.
Medications:	Metoprolol, Asa, Lisinopril, Lipitor, Lasix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  Frequent 50-75uV, 100 msec positive sharp transients
occur bilaterally over the occipital regions of the head during saccadic eye movements with the
eyes open.  Intermittent eye flutter artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, other, intermittent, eye flutter
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Intermittent eye flutter artifact could have obscured subtle anterior slowing.
