CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with past medical history of hypernatremia, seizures, vent-dependent respiratory failure, schizophrenia, presented with change in mental status and previous history of break-through seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well, diffusely slow EEG with a background that reveals that a PDR that at best reaches 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.  The recording remains slow, but appears to react to painful stimulation and increases slightly in frequency.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 at times independently at T3 and at the same time some infrequent F8/T4 sharp waves are also seen.
Generalized slow waves at 4-6 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral anterior temporal and mid temporal sharp waves (left much more than right).
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
