CLINICAL HISTORY:   53 year old woman status post aneurysm and shunt placement on the right with memory loss, loss of awareness and funny feeling occurring 3-5 times per week.

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Lamictal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is subtle rhythmic slowing and a breech rhythm identified in the left frontocentral region. Photic stimulation does not elicit significant driving. Of note, however, towards the close of the record as the patient becomes drowsier. Focal slowing in the right frontocentral region is apparent.

HR: 	90 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Rhythmic slowing in right frontocentral region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process, congruent with the past neurosurgical history. No epileptiform features were observed.
