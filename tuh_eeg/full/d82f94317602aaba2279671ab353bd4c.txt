History:	66 year old woman admitted with progressive worsening neurological status.
Medications:	Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
There no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of diffuse fast activity
admixed with polymorphic theta activity.  Under riding, at times, rhythmic (at ~1 Hz) diffuse delta
activity is seen.  This activity is more pronounced over the right and has broad base and some AP
lag.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
More pronounced delta activity, at times sharply contoured, at higher amplitudes and more
pronounced fast activity are noted over the left temporal region.  No clear epileptiform discharges
and seizures are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal
Breach artifact, left temporal
Triphasic waves, intermittent, bilateral (R>L)
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing,
moderate focal left temporal slowing and suspected triphasic waveforms that are more pronounced
over the right. Diffuse slowing finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing in the left temporal is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  Breach artifact is secondary to skull defect.  Triphasic
waveforms are seen in various encephalopathies.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the
