History:	73 year old man who presents with several witnessed seizures.
Medications:	KEPPRA, Ativan and propofol (now off)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of 10-11 Hz alpha activity.  There is AP gradient.  Diffuse
excess beta activity is captured.  During brief drowsiness, there is diffuse voltage attenuation and
decrease in EMG artifact.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake and briefly drowsy portable 21-minute EEG. The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
