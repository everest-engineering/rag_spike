History:	20 year old woman who suffered a syncopal event vs a seizure ~ 1 month ago.

Patient is tense throughout the recording.
Medications:	CITALOPRAM,TRAZODONE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
During periods of maximal relaxation, the background consists of moderate amplitude well
modulated 10.5 alpha activity posteriorly with expected AP gradient.  Throughout the majority of
the recording, intrusions of additional diffuse posteriorly predominant polymorphic theta and delta
activity are captured.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute awake-only EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  However, in this
patient, suspect that slowing is at least partially related to patient's inability to relax fully.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
