DATES OF RECORDING:  09/12/2012 from approximately 3 p.m. until 09/13/2012 until approximately 8:30 a.m.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 22-year-old woman with new onset of convulsive episodes concerning for epileptic seizures versus nonepileptic events.

MEDICATIONS:  None, Keppra given on 09/11/2012.

INTRODUCTION:  This is a continuous video EEG monitoring performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Spike detector software was activated.  Also, the patient alarm was provided.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low-to-moderate amplitude gradient 10-10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency and amplitude gradient with faster frequencies and lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, sleep spindles, vertex waves, K-complex, slow wave sleep and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  There are several pushbutton events throughout the recording.  Those are related to the system testing and not to the patient events.

FINDINGS:  No electrographic seizures and no events.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal 12-24 hour continuous video EEG recording.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  No typical events occurred.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
