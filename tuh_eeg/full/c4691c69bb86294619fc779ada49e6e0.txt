CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old man, victim of head trauma now with seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra, Labetalol, Serax, Hydralazine, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient has a remarkable craniotomy defect in the left cranium and left scalp edema.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates marked asymmetry. The activity on the right is lower voltage and a mixture of delta and beta. There is a clear breach rhythm in the left with faster frequency activity and frontal sharp waves typically at F3 or F7, but with someÂ· variability. Poly spike activity is observed. Features of drowsiness include an Increase In slowing. Review of activity demonstrates primarily a left frontal F3 focus with some variability in terms of its field of spread.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent left frontal epileptiform activity typically seen about 10 times in a 10 second period, but without frequency evolution.
2. Prominent interhemispheric asymmetry.
3. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports both a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a prominent epileptiform focus in the left frontal region. The bio hemispheric changes may contribute to the patient's mental status.
