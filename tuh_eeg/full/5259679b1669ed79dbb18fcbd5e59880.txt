CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male with new onset epilepsy with first-ever seizures characterized by tonic/clonic seizures after alcohol ingestion.  The patient was admitted to the medical ICU for alcohol withdrawal.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan drip, midazolam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had received an Ativan bolus just prior to the EEG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern with generous, continuous beta and smaller amounts of delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces a muscle activity but minimal alerting.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with beta frequency pattern.
Lower voltage delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is some head rocking artifact in this record but no definitive focal or epileptiform features.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study when the patient is out of the ICU may be considered.
