CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old gentleman with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Last
seizure was 1 month ago. Tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness lasting a
minute followed by a day of postictal drowsiness.
MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine, Baclofen, Risperidone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or
photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern
with a mixture of theta and delta. There are shifting asymmetries with somewhat higher
activity identified on the right compared to the left on occasion. The left seems to be a
bit more featureless. There was no well defined posterior dominant rhythm. Prominent
eye blink artifact is noted. There is also a suggestion of some focal fast activity in the
right frontal region.
HR: 50 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Paucity of normal wave forms anticipated for an adult of this age.
3. Right frontal focal fast activity.
CLINICAL These findings may be correlated with imaging and
supported by hemispheric process. The focal fast activity may correlate with the
localization of this patient's epilepsy.
