History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON 28 YR MALE WITH H/O SZS X2 YRS.  LAST SZ 1 MONTH
AGO. AURA (ECHO), LOC AND SOME SHAKING.  PMHX: HTN
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves. POSTS are seen.  Stage II sleep is
characterized by vertex waves and sleep spindles.
No focal slowing is present.  There are rare independent left and right anterior temporal sharp
waves seen.  Additionally there are rhythmic 3-4Hz right anterior temporal complexes that may
represent sharp and slow complexes lasting 2-4 seconds.  Alternatively these waves may represent
temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA).
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
intermediate flash rates.  There was no apparent clinical correlate to the runs of sharp-and-slow
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare, left frontotemporal
Sharp-and-slow-wave complexes, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Sharp waves, rare, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to independent temporal sharp waves and
rhythmic sharp-and-slow waves over the right. These findings suggest epileptogenic zones in the
left and right temporal lobes, possibly associated with a structural brain lesion.
