CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed woman with adult onset epilepsy and seizures, now characterized by the patient as black out and brown out spells.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. In relaxed wakefulness and accentuated in hyperventilation there is intermittent, left temporal focal slowing with high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in overall rhythmicity. The epileptiform discharges are most prominent in the initial sections of the record. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. left anterior temporal focal slowing.
2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform activity is more prominent in this EEG than in more recent studies. This may be due to the occurrence of 2 spells over the preceding weekend. No generalized spike and wave activity was seen today.
