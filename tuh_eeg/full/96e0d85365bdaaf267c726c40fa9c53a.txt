History:	55 YO MALE, DX.-LOCALIZATION RELATED (FOCAL, PARTIAL) EPILEPSY AND
EPILEPTIC SYNDROMES WITH COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURE, WITH
INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY.  F/U EEG
Medications:	keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region (at T3) during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.
