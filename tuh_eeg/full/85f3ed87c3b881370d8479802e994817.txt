LENGTH OF RECORDING:  28 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of seizures since childhood.  Seizures re-started since stopping her medications.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at the lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Hyperventilation is produced with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no driving.  During drowsiness posterior dominate rhythm attenuates and voltage is attenuated diffusely.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 28-minute electroencephalogram.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage 2 may be of benefit.
