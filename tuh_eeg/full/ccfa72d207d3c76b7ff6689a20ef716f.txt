CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old woman with history of bilateral strokes, right motor weakness, and febrile.  Patient had an episode on the commode with staring off into space, poor responsiveness.  Ischemic cerebral vascular disease
MEDICATIONS:  Milrinone, Keppra and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   This was a 20-minute bedside recording with good overall impedance.  The patient was drowsy throughout the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  The posterior dominant rhythm 9.7 Hz is noted, but is at times somewhat slower.  Shifting slowing was noted.  As the patient became drowsy, there are bursts of rhythmic delta and an increase in beta.  There is some shifting slowing noted in the right hemisphere including centrotemporal region.
Towards the close of the record, when the patient is stimulated, the overall background is disorganized and the alpha rhythm is more of an 8-8.3 hertz range.
Heart rate was irregular at 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
Irregular heart rate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The shifting slowing described above may be correlated with this patient's imaging.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be undertaken.
