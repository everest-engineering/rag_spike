CLINICAL HISTORY: A 66-year-old male with history of alcohol abuse. found down, somnolent, 5
minute episode of shaking in the emergency room.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, antibiotics, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG Is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard, 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient Is quite somnolent but somewhat responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern, low in voltage with mixed
theta and delta as wen as smaller amounts of beta. The record demonstrates subtle, intermittent
attenuations of less than 1 second in duration.
There is reactivity and variability with some sections of the record demonstrating more theta than others.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a generalized slow pattern .
2. Intermittent attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. Overall, this EEG is most supportive of
a bihemispheric, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as might be seen in a toxic or metabolic
encephalopathy or postictal state.
