History:	20 YO MALE W/ TBI FROM MVA IN 2013
PT IS MISSING SKULL ON LEFT FRONTO-TEMPORAL REGION.PT SAYS HE
WAS TOLD HE HAS HAD SZ SINCE ACCIDENT, HE CAN NOT RECALL ANY
DETAIL. AFFECTED AREA INVOLVES T5,T3, F7, FP3, F3, C3, P3, CZ, FZ.
Medications:	Patient does not know what meds he is currently on.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta at times sharply contoured activity is present in the left hemisphere
maximal in the central region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.   There is an
associated increased voltage and faster frequencies in the region consistent with a breach.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Breach artifact
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal in the central region
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of left hemispheric focal slowing
maximal in the central region with an associated breach. This findings are consistent with the
known lesion and craniectomy.
