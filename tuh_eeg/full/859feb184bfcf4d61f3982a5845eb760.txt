History:	24 YO PT PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ SINCE CHILDHOOD, EPISODES OF
STARRING SPELLS. PT HAD 2 EPISODES ON 2/18. PMHX SIG FOR MMR,
Medications:	KLONOPIN,TRILEPTAL,KEPPRA,LAMOTRIGINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at T5/A1 and independently at F7/T3 during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal spike-and-wave discharges and sharp
waves are present in the left posterior temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent temporal, posterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, occasional temporal, posterior
Interpretation:
This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly
arising from the left posterior temporal region. In addition there is evidence independent left
posterior and anterior midtemporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to
