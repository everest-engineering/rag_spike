CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elderly woman status post resection of olfactory groove meningioma, sacral decubitus, patient presented with change in mental status and intermittent clonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Depakote, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was undertaken using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  During the record, the patient was increasingly responsive with eye opening.  She continued to have intermittent clonus.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat obscured by muscle and movement artifact, but there is a diffusely slow theta frequency pattern.  Rare, left frontal sharp waves were noted.  At the bedside, tactile stimulation of the patient produces the patient's typical clonus with movement artifact.  Next, the sleep pattern is not so dissimilar to the awake pattern with a diffusely slow pattern.
Epileptiform Detections:  There are rare frontal sharp waves noted.  These are a bit more prominent from the left.  In this very challenging record, there is also some sharply contoured activity at C4, CZ.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
A markedly abnormal background.
A very challenging recording session because of the patient's artifact and spasticity.
Multiple episodes of spasticity.
There are occasional sharp waves noted in this record including left frontal or right central.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  The focal epileptiform features may be correlated with the imaging, but no clinical seizures were recorded.
