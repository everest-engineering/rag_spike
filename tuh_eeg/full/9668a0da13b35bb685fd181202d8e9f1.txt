CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old male with posttraumatic epilepsy admitted with
Dilantin toxicity, prominent cerebellar atrophy.
MEDICATION Dilantin, Ativan
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates prominent
beta activity throughout with head rocking artifact in the posterior regions. There is an
asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic slowing on the left. The patient is poorly
cooperative. Vertex waves are noted as he drifts into stage I sleep.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Primarily beta frequency pattern.
2. Excess theta.
3. Superimposed rhythmic slowing a bit more prominent on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION No epileptiform features were observed. The beta In the
background EEG may be due to this patient's medications. If further characterization of
his epilepsy is needed, a follow-up study in the lab is suggested.
