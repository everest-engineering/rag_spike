CLINICAL HISTORY:  74 year old woman with a history of a TIA in June 2011 with left sided weakness with past medical history of stents and bypass who states he has had a headache for 2 weeks that does not want to stop and memory loss.  Denies any new weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Zocor, ASA, Norvasc, Diovan/hydrochlorothiazide, Glucophage, Lopressor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Memory loss and recent stroke.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a nice anterior to posterior gradient including normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation but there were no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3, much more frequently at F8/T4 at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At times the focal slowing on the left was sharply contoured but not clearly pathologic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left more than right anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction independently in both anterior temporal regions (left more than right), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
