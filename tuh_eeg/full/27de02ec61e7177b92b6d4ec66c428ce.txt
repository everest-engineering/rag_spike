CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with adult-onset epilepsy. Prior  EEGs with frontally predominant 3-5 hertz spike and wave activity. Now 2 seizures in the last 9 months, 1 associated with sleep deprivation and alcohol ingestion and the 2nd with dehydration. The patient is not experiencing absence or myoclonic seizures at this time.
MEDICINES:  Lamictal, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  There is generous background beta.  Notable in this record is an occipitally predominant 5 hertz rhythmic discharge.  It is occipitally predominant and has at times almost a spike and wave complex.  It is typically more prominent in the right occipital region than the left, although on occasion, does appear to be a bit more prominent on the left.
The discharge is prominent at the midline with a slight predominance to the left.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation clearly accentuate this discharge.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Posteriorly predominant, right greater than left, 5 hertz discharge.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The activity described above is probably an epileptiform variant and may be related to this patient's previous generalized spike and wave discharge.  The activity is more prominent at the midline and just to the right of the midline, although it is sometimes seen on the left. No clinical events were recorded.
