CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old woman with change in mental status after cholecystectomy.  Generalized weakness.  History of marked confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Unasyn.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  The patient was described as quite lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is quite abnormal with diffuse slowing with a mixture of theta and delta.  Bursts of FIRDA are noted.  Brief stimulation of the patient produces an arousal with 6 Hz activity.  There are also features of sleep with vertex waves.  Photic stimulation does elicit a brief driving response.
HR:    108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most suggestive of a toxic or metabolic process.  No epileptiform features were seen.  The presence of normal features of wakefulness and sleep is a positive feature.
