HISTORY: 56 year old right-handed male admitted to the ICU on 6/17/2010, after head trauma, subdural hematoma. Please evaluate.

MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Dilantin, Morphine, Labetalol, Folate Folic Acid.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a subdural hematoma on the left and left craniectomy. He is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG is remarkable for very low voltage flow pattern. The activity is slightly higher on the left compared to the right and, in fact, there is a bit more beta and theta on the left compared to the right. Both hemispheres demonstrates lower voltage low delta. There is some variability in the record with some sections of the record demonstrating a bit more theta frequency activity. The breach rhythm is identified particularly at 3. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record so much but there is variability in the record.
HR: 110 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Breach rhythm with higher amplitude activity on the left.
2. Markedly slow pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings should be placed into the clinical context. Although the patient did not seem to be so reactive to tactile stimulation, there was variability noted in the record.
