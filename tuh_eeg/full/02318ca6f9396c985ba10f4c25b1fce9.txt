History:	28 year old woman status post PEA arrest.
Medications:	No CNS medications
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of burst suppression with variable
interburst intervals lasting 5 seconds up to 70 seconds.  Burst lasts approximately 1second. Bursts
consist of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude blunted and slow delta activity.  No normal sleep
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no reactivity to visual,
auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of 120 beats/Min
with intermittent abnormal QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern
Interpretation:
This a very abnormal 23 minute portable EEG due to a variable degree of burst suppression and
lack of background reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  In a patient with post anoxic brain injury, this pattern indicates poor
chance of full neurological recovery.  When compared to the EEG from 12/10/2014, busts of
activity are less well formed and degree of burst-suppression is more severe.  These findings were
conveyed to the neurology consult team
