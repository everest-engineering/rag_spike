CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old male with known CNS lesion presented at 9:45 this morning with an episode of his eye rolling back, then left hand shaking, then entire body with postictal confusion and left-sided weakness.  Past history of prostate cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite confused and had difficulty cooperating with the test.  Photic stimulation was completed.
TECHNICAL:  Impedances were acceptable.  There was a fair amount of muscle artifact.  This increases as the recording continues and the patient is agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm on the left.  The left hemisphere is somewhat disorganized.  The right  hemisphere is more significantly disorganized, lacks  well-defined posterior dominant rhythm.  Although there is a fair of movement, there is some right mid temporal sharp-waves maximum at T4.  There is no mention of a breach rhythm, but there is a beta asymmetry as well noted intermittently.  The beta is much more prominent in the left frontocentral region and at CZC4.
Agitation is characterized by an increase in muscle in an alert patient.  Drowsiness is characterized by a bit of slowing.
Photic stimulation was unsuccessful in this agitated adult.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity in the presence of slowing.
Rare right temporal sharp-waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving both gray and white matter.  The simple sharp-waves described above may be correlated with this patient's clinical history and imaging.
