CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed male with history of seizures and complaint of chest pain.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, ASA, Cyclobenzaprine, Protonix, Lamictal, Lisinopril, Lovenox, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F8/T2 and at times just at T2 occurring in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Focal slow waves at F8/T2 seen frequently and at times with a rhythmic polymorphic pattern consistent with temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA).
Mild generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal and midtemporal sharp waves.
Temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy arising from the right anterior temporal or midtemporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
