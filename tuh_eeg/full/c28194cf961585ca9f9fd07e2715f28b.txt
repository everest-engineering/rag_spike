followed by an increase in beta. The patient looks to be falling asleep or has a posture
of someone who is sleeping actually when the EEG pattern demonstrates an awake
pattern. This can be seen in normals or in someone who is actually somewhat sleepy.
Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  This is followed by an increase in beta.  The patient looks to be falling asleep or has a posture of someone who is sleeping  actually when the EEG pattern demonstrates an awake pattern.  This can be seen in normals or in someone who is actually somewhat sleepy.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
HR: 72bpm
