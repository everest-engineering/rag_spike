STUDY DATE:  01/14/2013 to 01/15/2013 for a total of 15 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman with recurrent seizures despite multiple medications here for seizure differential and classification.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep including REM.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves at F7/T3 and F8/T4 (Left > Right) seen intermittently in wakefulness and sleep.
EPISODES OR EVENTS:  None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral (left more than right) anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen in day 1 of recording.
