CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old man admitted with seizures, subsequently found to be in focal status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include:  Keppra, Zonisamide and Dilantin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed intermittently throughout the recording period by the attending neurologist.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During maximal wakefulness the background  consisted of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  During sleep frequent periods of discontinuity and diffuse sleep spindle-like wave forms are observed.  There is prosody of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
Focal left hemispheric slowing.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is abnormal 24 hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization that are more pronounced over the left hemisphere.  Diffuse slowing indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology, and is consistent with the patient's history of prior left MCA stroke.  No electrographic seizures were captured.  When compared to the prior 24 hour recording seizures are no longer observed.  These findings were conveyed to the Primary Team.
