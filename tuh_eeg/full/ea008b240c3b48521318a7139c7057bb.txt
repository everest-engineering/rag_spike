The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I, and stage II.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The patient was recorded for an hour.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded wakefulness in stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which produced no abnormal discharges.

SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate 60.
