History:	54 year old woman who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	Methadone, Insulin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
polymorphic moderate voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology
are present.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep
architecture was present but periods of quiescence were noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Triphasic waves, occasional
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 25-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing, absent
alpha rhythm and triphasic waveforms.  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Triphasic
waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and
anoxia.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
