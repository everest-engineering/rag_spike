TODAY FOR DIFFICULTY SLEEPING KEEPS WAKING UP AND NOT FALLING
BACK TO SLEEP
Medications:	Trileptal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Asymmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is higher amplitude on the left central region.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles appear.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. There is a higher amplitude on the left and increased faster
frequencies consistent with a breach.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left central, Associated breach.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing and
breach in the left central region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
