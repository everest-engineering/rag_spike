CLINICAL HISTORY: A 48-year-old male with left focal seizures for the past 6 weeks . They occur 4-5 times per day, but stopped when he started Keppra. The patient has a history of left arm dystonia and then severe right leg pain and then bilateral left leg shaking, which lasted a minute.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Glucotrol, and others.
I NTRODUCTION: One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained. Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation activate the record. Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were seen. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged study may be considered.
