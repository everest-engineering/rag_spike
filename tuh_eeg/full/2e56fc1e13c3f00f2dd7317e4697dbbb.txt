History:	64 year old male presents on 9/30/14 s/p pea code at home ( down time unknown).
Pmhx sig for cirrhosis, hep c, etoh abuse.
Medications:	keppra, ativan prn
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a burst-suppression pattern with
burst-to-suppression ratio of ~ 1:3-1:8.  Interburst interval is ~ 8-24 seconds and bursts last ~ 3-4
seconds.  Bursts start with frontally predominant diffuse mixture of polymorphic moderate-to-high
amplitude delta and sharply contoured theta activity.  This activity attenuates at the end of the
burst and consists primarily of theta.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No episodes of jerks are reported.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no reactivity to visual,
auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  HR was 90 and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Event, not recorded
Burst-suppression pattern, ~1:3-1:8
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG due to burst-suppression pattern at ~1:3-1:8 ratio and lack of
reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No episodes of jerks are reported.
