CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old left handed female with 2 months of left sided headache and blurry vision, no loss of consciousness, no vomiting, no history of epilepsy, episodic mood disorder.
MEDICATIONS: Citalopram, Alprazolam, Temazepam, Amantadine, Fluphenazine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized. It includes an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. In the transition to drowsiness there is some rhythmic theta noted in the background. Abundant stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation is completed while the patient is in stage II sleep, but there is a driving response.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features. The transition to drowsiness is a pattern that is within normal limits with a prominent theta.
