CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old woman with epilepsy since age 25 but seizure free for the last 9 years.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Metformin, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 75 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
