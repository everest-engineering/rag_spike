:
History:	30 year old man with a history of seizures.  Patient has a history of GSW to the head
status post left temporal craniotomy.
Medications:	TEGRETOL, NEURONTIN AND OTHERS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The background over the right hemisphere consists of low-to-moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha
activity with expected AP gradient.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of
polymorphic 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity, poor AP gradient, low amplitude polymorphic theta and delta
activity and continuous anterior moderate amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity with
additional fast frequencies (breach rhythm).  Vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Breach artifact, left anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left hemispheric
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to mild focal left hemispheric
slowing and continuous moderate left anterior slowing. These findings indicate focal cerebral
dysfunction that is especially pronounced over the anterior quadrant.  These cerebral dysfunction is
likely structural in etiology and is consistent with patient's history of GSW to the left hemisphere.
Breach rhythm is secondary to the skull defect.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
