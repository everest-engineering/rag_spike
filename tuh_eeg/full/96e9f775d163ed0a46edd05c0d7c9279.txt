EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes. Awake, hyperventilation, photic
Waking background Is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions. As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear. During stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse second (fps) does not produce any effect. Heart rate is 60-70 bpm.
