CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, seizure-free
for the past 20 years.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Nexium

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
symmetric reactive alpha rhythm. The alpha is 8.5 Hz In frequency but there is a small
amount of11 Hz activity in the background. Features of drowsiness include an increase
in beta. Slow-rolling eye movements and attenuation of the record characterize the early
stage I sleep record followed by lower voltage vertex waves. Hyperventilation does not
active the record. Photic stimulation elicits low voltage driving pattern.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was generous background beta identified in this
record compatible with the patient's phenobarbital. This was not a sleep deprived nor
fasting record. Additional studies performed fasting and/or sleep deprived may be
needed to characterize what has been described as a primary generalized epilepsy for
this individual.
