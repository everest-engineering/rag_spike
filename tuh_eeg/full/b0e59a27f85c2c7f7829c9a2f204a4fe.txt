CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with intracranial injury, right subdural hematoma, bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, mass effect, left midline shift, left basilar skull and left zygomatic fractures, some falcine extension of subdural hematoma, left midline shift.  The patient was reported to have had seizure-related trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative and restless.  Impedances were satisfactory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a diffusely slow pattern.  The left hemisphere demonstrates primarily theta frequency activity with a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and generous 4-6 Hz activity.  The right hemisphere demonstrates attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right with lower voltage slow activity.  The patient is not able to cooperate and is frequently shifting throughout the EEG.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Essentially continuous focal slowing with delta on the right, particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
Attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right.
Diffuse background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were noted in this record.  Previous EEGs are not available for this patient at this time.  A previous EEG was recorded in 2009 if comparison is needed.  This EEG supports a structural process on the right, congruent with the surgical history as well as the diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, congruent with an acute CNS injury.
