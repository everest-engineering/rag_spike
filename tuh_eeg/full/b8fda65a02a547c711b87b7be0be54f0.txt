History:	26 year old man with new onset seizures on 7/26/14, with 5 reported generalized
convulsions in a single day.  Last seizure occurred on 7/30/2014.  Of note, patient is
reportedly off his medications.
Medications:	Zonisamide, Effexor, Lorazepam, Tramadol, Meloxicam, Acetaminophen-COD #3 - it
is unclear which medications he still takes.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at high frequency flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2, brief
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and briefly asleep. The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
