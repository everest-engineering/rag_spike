CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Temazepam, Lacosamide, Truvada, Paxil, Valtrex, Protonix, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10â•–20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has ad 5 previous seizures the day before but is feeling well during the EEG. Photic stimulation was performed but not hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG a great deal of muscle and movement artifact. Underneath this, there is high amplitude activity in the left anterior temporal region. This section is left anterior temporal. It accompanies a background rich in beta frequency a as well as theta. There is a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm. The left frontotemporal sharp waves reach amplitudes of 72 microvolts and may occur with burs s. Clinical symptoms are not noted with the seizures. Photic stimulation elicits no driving. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and theta.
90bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Focal slowing with more significant arrhythmic delta activity in the hemisphere.
3. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
4. Rhythmic theta in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural functional process on the left as well as a focal mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded.
