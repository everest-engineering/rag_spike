CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed gentleman with obesity, sleep apnea
and pain radiating down the arms and the legs. Past history of a fall down the stairs. Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, ? others.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record in a very drowsy
individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha
rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements followed by
POSTS. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Following
hyperventilation, the patient drifts into stage 2 sleep. He is noted to snore prominently. He awakens in the EEG at 11:39:42 p.m. to complain of pain in his extremities. This pain is not associated with a change in the EEG and the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern. He drifts back to sleep with a drowsy pattern and background slowing. Hypersynchronous rhythmic flowing is noticed as he transitions in and out of sleep. Photic stimulation was not performed.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. This patient's clinical symptoms of pain in the extremities was not associated with epileptiform features.
