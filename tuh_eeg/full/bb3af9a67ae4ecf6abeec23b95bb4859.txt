Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional generalized mainly symmetric frontocentral maximal
polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur during the recording.  At times in bursts for seconds and
some appear to have a slightly asymmetric onset.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Polyspike-and-wave complexes, intermittent, Frontocentral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of bifrontocentral synchronous polyspike-
and-wave discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic and supportive of a generalized epilepsy.
Alternatively the slight asymmetry seen may support a focal epilepsy with rapid bilateral spread.
