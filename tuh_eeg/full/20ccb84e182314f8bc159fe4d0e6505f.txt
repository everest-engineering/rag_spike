History:	40 year old woman with Moya-Moya disease
Medications:	Depakote, Topamax, Gabapentin, Aspirin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity and diffuse excess theta activity are noted.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is continuous subtle bilateral low-amplitude frontotemporal theta-delta activity, left>right.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal, mild-to-moderate, subtle
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and subtle
continuous focal mild-to-moderate bilateral frontotemporal slowing, left>right. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal
slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Excess beta activity
could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
