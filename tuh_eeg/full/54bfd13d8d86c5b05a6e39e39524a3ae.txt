CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 YO LH FEMALE PAST JULY LOST TRACK OF TIME AND WAS IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT. CAN NOT RECALL DRIVING CAR BEFORE ACCIDENT.
MEDICATIONS:  Paxil, Endocet, other
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a routine, 20 minute, EEG capturing wakefulness and brief sleep with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  It is technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage pattern with a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm noted in drowsiness.
Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A low voltage EEG is not considered pathological.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat study is suggested.
