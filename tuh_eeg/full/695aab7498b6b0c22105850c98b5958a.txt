CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old right handed woman with 2 episodes of involuntary movements at dialysis, renal failure, blindness, possible seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lispro, Insulin, Glargine, Phoslo, Calcium, Acetate, ASA, Metoprolol, Amlodipine, Lipitor.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, sections of the record including a well-organized pattern with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm followed by other sections with paroxysmal higher amplitude rhythmic slowing. Hyperventilation produces an increase in higher amplitude paroxysmal slowing. Features of drowsiness include paroxysmal slowing followed by vertex waves. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation. There is minimal driving.

HR: 78 to 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent paroxysmal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. The intermittent paroxysmal slowing is a nonspecific finding and may be correlated with her underlying metabolic abnormalities.
