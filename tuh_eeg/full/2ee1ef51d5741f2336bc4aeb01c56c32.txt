CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old male with massive left middle cerebral artery infarct 4 days, edema, evaluate for brain activity and possible brain death.

MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Vitamin B 12, Insulin, Dilantin, Metoprolol, Cyancobalamin, Zocor, Vancomycin, Zosyn

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The recording includes conventional montages and ECS montage. The patient is stimulated during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly low voltage and quite suppressed. There is ECG and ventilator artifact noted in the record. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record. Despite the use of various techniques, there is some artifact observed at F4 C4. This is a 9.5 Hz artifact. This artifact differs from what may be artifactual but is not necessarily absolutely artifactual with an island of cerebral activity in the right frontocentral region. In addition, there is a fair amount of muscle and other artifacts.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked suppression of the background cerebral activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG does not meet the technical criteria for ECS. There is potentially an island of cerebral activity and there is enough other artifact in the record to preclude an absolute assessment of electrocerebral inactivity. Other measures including other diagnostic techniques or the use of a neuromuscular blockade may be helpful.
