History:	34 YR MALE WITH MULTIPLE GTC CONVULSIONS, NON-EPILEPTIC EVENTS, TOURETTES SYNDROME, ASTHMA, IV HEROIN USE.
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, NEURONTIN, GABAPENTIN, METHADONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
HR was 72.
Technical difficulties:
Frequent motion artifact is present throughout the recording.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation: This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
