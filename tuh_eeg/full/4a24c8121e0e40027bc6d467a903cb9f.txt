CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old gentleman status post prolonged cardiac arrest on the 14th.

MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Plavix, Lasix, Zosyn, ASA, Pravachol, Simvastatin, Pantoprazole, Plavix

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with continuous, frontally predominant bilateral periodic complex. Most of this activity is bilateral and in the frontal regions. There is some variability in the record and on occasion it is a little bit more posterior. The activity waxes and wanes and it clearly demonstrates frequency evolution. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.

HR: 140 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A PLEDS pattern .with frequency evolution.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern is a worrisome prognostic pattern following cardiac arrest but it is a more epileptiform periodic pattern which may warrant follow-up.
