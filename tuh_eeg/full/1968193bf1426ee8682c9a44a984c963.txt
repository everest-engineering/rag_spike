CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman with multi-system failure, ARDS, status post intubation earlier on the 16th.  The patient was critically ill, but responsive until the intubation.  Now unresponsive with small pupils and trace cornea on the right.  Past history of fibromyalgia, psychosis and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lex, Sux, Etomid, Vec, Phenylephrine, Dopamine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient was intubated, comatose, and suffering an upper GI bleed during the EEG.  She was hemodynamically unstable at that time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, rich in theta. There is a small amount of beta.  There is some shifting asymmetries.  In addition, occasional left temporal sharp waves were noted.  At times these may occur in pairs or several over the course of a 10 second period.  Occasionally, the sharp waves are followed by generalized attenuation.  There is also some shifting arrhythmic delta activity more so on the left than the right and occasional right-sided right mid temporal isolated sharp waves.
Tactile stimulation does not clearly activate the record.
Heart rate: 140 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to.
Significant background slowing.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
Left temporal sharp waves which are sometimes followed by attenuation.
Right temporal sharp waves.
Clinical correlation:  In this unsedated patient, this EEG supports a significant, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Correlation with the severity of this patient's background slowing and clinical findings is suggested.
