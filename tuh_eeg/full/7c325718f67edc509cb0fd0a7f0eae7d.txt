History:	43 year old woman with a history of seizures and ill-defined cerebrovascular
Medications:	Klonopin, Oxycodone, Percocet, Remeron, Baclofen, Celexa, Statin.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal, waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is significant EMG artifact during large portions of
wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm slows to 8.5 Hz and EMG artifact subsides.
Subtle intermittent voltage attenuation is noted over the left hemisphere.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed due to patient noncooperation.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Attenuation, intermittent, mild, left hemispheric, subtle
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to subtle intermittent left hemispheric
voltage attenuation. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
