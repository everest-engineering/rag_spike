History:	57 YO MALE INCARCERATED SINCE MARCH FOR DUI. P/W EPISODIC MEMORY
LOSS. THIS HAS HAPPEN 16 TIMES SINCE APRIL. PT PASSED OUT ON FEB 10
2014 HITTING HIS HEAD WHILE WORKING. AGAIN HE PASSED OUT IN APRIL, +
SHAKING/ + EYE TWITCHING
Medications:	EXCEDRIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During limited stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
76 some PVC's
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and limited asleep.
