CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old gentleman with a single seizure after nasal sinus surgery 2 years ago, complicated by meningitis.  Now, with neck pain, dizziness, and poor balance.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a somewhat technically challenging record in the restless patient.  It was difficult to achieve good impedances and a relaxed state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of beta muscle activity and scant theta.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record with good effort.  Hyperventilation initially generates some shifting, slowing followed by bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude 3.5 to 4 Hz bursts of spike and wave activity of 3-5 seconds duration with after going slow waves.
This is followed by drowsiness with an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  At the close of the record, the patient transitioned into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of rhythmic, frontal spike and wave activity elicited by hyperventilation.
Small degree of background slowing and disorganization with shifting and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were recorded.  The brief bursts of spike and wave activity were elicited only by hyperventilation.  This finding can be seen in those with epilepsy, or those with a genetic trait for epilepsy The bihemispheric features described above may be correlated with history and imaging.
