CLINICAL 66 year old female with past medical history of hypertension, TIA,
hyperlipidemia, right anterior parietal right thalamic stroke with diabetes,
peripheral vascular disease, sciatica, L4-L5. Presents with acute onset of disorientation lasting
6-7 hours.
MEDICATION: Lovenox.
REASON FOR STUDY: Rule out seizures .
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode
placement system with addition of anterior electrodes and EKG electrodes.
Wakefulness and sleep were reported. Activated procedure photic stimulation was
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant
rhythm of 9-10 Hz and 20-60 mV amplitude which is reactive to eye opening and eye closing.
Normal frontal central beta is seen. Sleep is characterized by stage 1. The rhythm procedure
with photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves seen at T4 frequently at -4Hz with 20-70 mV.
2. Focal slow waves seen infrequently at F7 3 at 2-4 Hz and 20-70 mV amplitude.
SEIZURES: None.
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bilateral independent right midtemporal.
2. left anterior temporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the
region more than the left anterior temporal region, both of which are
regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform seizures were seen.
