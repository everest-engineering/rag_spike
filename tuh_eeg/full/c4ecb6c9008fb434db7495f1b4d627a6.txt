CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 89-year-old gentleman with dementia and schizophrenia, admitted with an episode of syncope followed by vomiting.
MEDICATIONS:  Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrated a somewhat slow and disorganized pattern with an alpha rhythm of approximately 6 Hz and small amounts of rhythmic to arrhythmic data as well as some shifting arrhythmic delta.  The arrhythmic delta can be in the right or left temporal region.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing and a decrease in eye movements.
Photic stimulation does not aggravate the record.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute and irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Disorganized pattern.
A slow pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  The background slowing and disorganization are nonspecific findings particularly in this age group but support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as dementia or encephalopathy.
