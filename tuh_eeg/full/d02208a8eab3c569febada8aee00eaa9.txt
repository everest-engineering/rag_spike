History:	76 year old woman with a seizure disorder.
Medications:	Depakote ER, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9-10 Hz.  The AP gradient is
unstable.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and
increases during drowsiness.  Drowsiness is characterized by increase in diffuse theta and brief
periods of discontinuity.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
