History:	35 yo male with a hx of nocturnal Sz since age 18. Only has Sz every year to year
and a half. Last SZ was in Nov. 2014. He wakes up from sleep combative and
wanders. He will come back to baseline and be as far as two miles from home.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
