History:	51 yo female had aneurysm (2) years ago (F7-F4 skull defect). Seizures secondary to
aneurysms. has not has a sz in 3 years. she has auras occasionally described as
feeling "eerie" she will stop and talk herself out of it. PMH: asthma.
Medications:	KEPPRA, TEGRETOL XR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
the left fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
