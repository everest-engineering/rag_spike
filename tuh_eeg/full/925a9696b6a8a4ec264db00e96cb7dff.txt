CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with intermittent episodes of confusion and speech difficulty.  History of fibromyalgia, Graves disease, Bell palsy, arthritis.


MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lisinopril, atenolol, thyroid supplement, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 60 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background.  Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

Heart rate 66 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG is wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
