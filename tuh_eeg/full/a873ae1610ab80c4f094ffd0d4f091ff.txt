CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old man who initially presented with a syncopal event on 07/22/2012 and was found to have a left cerebellar and left frontal stroke with intermittent placement and removal of a right frontal EVD.  He is now presenting with episodes of staring spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Novolin, Coumadin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are bursts of generalized rhythmic delta and bursts of shifting delta.  Some of these are prominent in the occipital regions.
HR:    104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The generalized background slowing and shifting slowing may be correlated with imaging.
