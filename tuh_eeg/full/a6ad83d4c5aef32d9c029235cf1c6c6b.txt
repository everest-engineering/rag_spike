CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old male, admitted with gunshot wound to the head and neck, pulseless for 20 minutes, requiring CPR at data not disclosed.  The patient suffered gunshot wound on October 1st.  On CT scan with diffuse cerebral edema.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Depakote, vitamin K, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Electrode placement was modified due to this patient's devices.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly low voltage and featureless.  There is clear, low voltage mixed theta delta in the frontal regions of approximately 20 microvolts.
Cerebral activity in the posterior regions is more suppressed.
Tactile stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Heart rate 136 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow and suppressed cerebral pattern.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this clinical context, these are worrisome findings.  Cerebral activity was present.  If clinically indicated, a repeat study to assess this ominous cerebral pattern may be considered.
