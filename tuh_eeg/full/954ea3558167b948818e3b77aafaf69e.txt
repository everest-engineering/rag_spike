CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old male admitted earlier this month with anoxic brain injury, status post phenobarbital loading, still with a right lower extremity
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, ASA, Plavix, Zocor, Pantoprazole, Heparin, Carvedilol, Heparin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is examined during the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an essentially continuous pattern but a markedly pathological pattern.  It is rich in faster frequency activity with occipital predominant spike activity and polyspike activity. The activity tends to be present in
the bilateral occipital scalp regions. Phase reversal ranges can include 01 or 02 as well as
bilateral occipital. There are also more generalized bilateral frontal sharp waves and some PLED-like activity.  Some of the discharges are polyphasic in nature.  Stimulation of the patient does not clearly activate the record, although on some occasions it does seem to produce flattening or an attenuation of the background.  The majority of the epileptiform activity is
present bilaterally in the posterior regions.  The activity is reviewed at various paper speeds and
is not associated with frequency evolution. HR: 	112 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Markedly abnormal pattern.
2. 	Occipitally predominant epileptiform activity.
3.	Polyspike activity.
4. 	Generalized epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is compatible with severe anoxic encephalopathy with epileptiform activity in the posterior regions. No seizures were recorded and the activity does not evolve at this time.
