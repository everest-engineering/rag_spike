CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 13.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.
The patient transitions frequently in and out of sleep. Vertex waves, K complexes,
spindles and POSTS are noted in sleep. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of
theta. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage II
sleep and a driving response is seen only at faster frequencies.
HR: 89 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL This patient's previous EEG results were not available at
this time for comparison but a normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If
seizures are frequent, an additional EEG recording may be helpful.
