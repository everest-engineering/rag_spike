History:	22YO WOMAN H/O PROFOUND MENTAL RETARDATION, CONGENITAL
MICROCEPHALUS, SCOLIOSIS  FOLLOW UP EEG.  PER MOM PT HAS GTC SZ
NOT DROP ATTACH.
Medications:	LAMICTAL, NIACIN, MIRALAX, AFRIN, BENZYL PEROXIDE, BISAC-EVAC SUPP,
DIASTAT
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There is however a very frequent frontally predominant but diffusely present beta
activity throughout the recording. Some of the discharges have the morphological appearance of
spindles but the patient is awake.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good
cooperation, and produces no effect.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The excess beta is of unclear significance but may be due to medication effect. No clear
epileptiform discharges were seen.
