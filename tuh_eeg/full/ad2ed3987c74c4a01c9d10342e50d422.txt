CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old gentleman with pain radiating down the left side of his body, blurred vision, and new onset seizures, past history of Percocet abuse 10 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  No seizure medications.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable 20 minute EEG with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a vigorous 10 hertz, alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 100 microvolts.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Lambda waves were also seen.  In drowsiness, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.  Posts, vertex waves, and K complexes were noted in stage 2 sleep but sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produced hyper synchronous rhythmic higher amplitude slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving response.  The patient seemed to be quite sleepy, transitioning in and out of sleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Overall, this is a youthful looking, vigorous EEG.
