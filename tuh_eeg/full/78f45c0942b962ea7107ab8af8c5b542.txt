CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with history of anticoagulation status post fall with head trauma, right occipital, parietal and epidural hematoma, left parietal fracture, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, post-traumatic seizure, status post 7 days prophylactic Keppra.  No additional seizures, numbness, weakness or tingling.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, oxycodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is reasonably well organized with a 10 Hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  There is scant theta in the frontocentral regions, right more so than the left.  There is a bit of shifting slowing and a bit more focal slowing on the right, as the patient becomes drowsy, but these are relatively subtle findings with a little underlying arrhythmic delta activity and some excess theta.  Vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Subtle focal slowing from the right, particularly frontocentral region.
A little shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The focal features described in this EEG are dramatically improved compared to a previous study, February 26.
