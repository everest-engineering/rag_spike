CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old male with bronchitis and epilepsy.  The patient had a seizure during a cough attack 2 weeks ago, found himself on the floor, was confused afterwards.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, promethazine, Claritin, Effexor, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In stage 2 sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted.
Hyperventilation was successfully performed and produced a small increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 40-minute EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.
