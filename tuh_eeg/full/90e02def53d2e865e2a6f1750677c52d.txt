History:	65 yo female p/w PEA arrest / anoxia. Down time 10-15 mins. ROSC after 2 rounds
of CPR and Epi. Now having periodic body jerking. CTH- Neg. PMHx: HTN, DM,
OSA, Anemia. - SZ hx
Medications:	Gentamicin, Meropenem
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No electrographic seizures
were present.  The patient did exhibit intermittent bilateral arm and body jerks. The EEG revealed
a myogenic artifact but no epileptiform or cerebral activity changes.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The jerks seen on video had no EEG correlate and do not appear to be cortical in nature.
