History:	44 year old man with a PMH of SDH, ESRD on HD, HIV, Hepatitis C and possible
dementia, now presents with change in mental status.

Of note, patient is uncooperative during the placement of the electrodes, so some
of the impedances are high.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Patient moves and chews throughout the entire study, so EEG is
technically limited.  The background consists of very low amplitude excess beta activity.  Patient is
awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited, due to continuous movement/ chewing artifact
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED 22 minute awake-only portable EEG because of abundant EMG
and electrode artifacts. No clear seizures are captured.  The background consists of diffuse excess
fast activity that could be medication related (such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates).
