REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of dizziness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 65-year-old man with episode of dizziness for 3-4 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, methotrexate, meclizine, Vasotec.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a low amount of frontal central beta seen in the limited wakefulness.  Patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed, which revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F8/T4, independently at T4, at a frequency of 2-4 Hz occasionally.
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
PROCEDURES:  None.
Heart rate 78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right anterior and mid temporal focal slowing in addition to mild-to-moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal and anterior temporal regions, in addition to mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, all of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
