Awake & asleep

International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic







Description:

Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. There is excess theta during wakefulness. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5- 7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.

There is intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region at T3 No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second {fps) does not produce any effect. HR 70



Summary of Findings:

Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid, T3 Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse



Interpretation:

This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing on the left midtemporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non? specific. In addition there is mild diffuse slowing, which is also non-specific with regards to etiology. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional in information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
