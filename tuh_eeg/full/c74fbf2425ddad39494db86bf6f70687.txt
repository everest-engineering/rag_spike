PMHX; DM, HTN, HL, CAD, CKD, HF, OSA, TUBAL LIGATION SURGERY.
Medications:	HEPARIN, CORRECTIVE INSULIN, ASA, ATORVASTATIN, METOPROLOL,
CEFEPINE, SEROQUEL, COUMADIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present but state changes were noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity and
variability to auditory stimuli.  HR was 100 with some PVCs
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
