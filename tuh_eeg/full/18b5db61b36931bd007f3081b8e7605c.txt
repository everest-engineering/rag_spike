CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old gentleman with a seizure during dialysis in the
context of a focal brain lesion with a hemorrhagic component.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Procardia, Glyburide, Protonix, Nephro, Carbatrol, Clonidine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized.
Much of the slow background includes a mixture of 8 Hz activity, 5 Hz activity and 2 Hz
activity. An alpha rhythm of 8 Hz is identified on the left but is disrupted on the right. In
addition, there is superimposed focal slowing in the right hemisphere particularly in the
posterior quadrant with 2 Hz delta activity. Occasional FIRDA is observed.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.Slow and disorganized pattern.
2. Superimposed focal features with delta on the right and disrupted alpha rhythm on
the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant disturbance of cerebral
function affecting both gray and white matter. Features can include toxic metabolic
encephalopathy as well as the diffuse and focal disturbance elicited by the structural
brain pathology on the right..
