CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old right handed woman with history of an aneurysm which was clipped 10 years ago.  Patient with a history of epilepsy, seizure-free on Dilantin until 1 week ago when she had multiple repetitive seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lipitor, Amlodipine, Actos
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background is poorly organized.  In addition, there is a prominent craniotomy artifact including EEG breach rhythm.  There is an alpha rhythm which ranges from 7.8-10 Hz.  There are bursts of sharply contoured slowing more commonly seen in the right temporal region with a generous field of spread than from the left.  Because of the breach, there is accentuation of faster frequency activity including alpha and beta in the left-right frontal regions.  Sharply contoured slowing may be identified at T1-F7 or T3.  As the patient becomes drowsy with features of spindles and K complexes, there is more disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere than the left. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background disorganization.
Shifting slowing as well as sharply contoured slowing particularly right or left temporal regions.
More prominent disruption of faster frequency activity on the right in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with epilepsy, seizures may arise from either hemisphere.  No seizures were recorded.  Previous EEGs were not provided.  A follow-up study as the patient's postictal state resolves may be helpful.
