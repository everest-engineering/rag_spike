History:	40 year female with seizures that started several months ago.  Events are
characterized by decreased responsiveness and facial twitching.

Pt had an event in EEG lab prior to the EEG hookup. Event lasted ~ 5 minutes, no
loss of consciousness but delayed response, facial twitching and post ictal fatigue.
Patient was evaluated by a neurology resident.
Medications:	Trileptal, Valium, Paxil
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Very brief waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Patient is asleep throughout most
of the recording.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent,  POSTS
(positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed with poor cooperation (patient falls asleep) and the period of
hyperventilation is shortened.  It produces no effect.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a normal mostly asleep and briefly awake 24-minute EEG. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
