CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with COPD, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease.  Previous right carotid endarterectomy,  now for left carotid with angioplasty.  Past history of ocular herpes.
MEDICATIONS:  Advair, albuterol, Plavix, Lyrica.  Others:  Prednisone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In wakefulness, there is intermittent rhythmic slowing noted with some 7 Hz activity or slowing of the alpha rhythm to 7 Hz.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 72 BPM, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age:
mild excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record.   The mild excess theta is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes.  Medications made even play a role in the pattern described above.
