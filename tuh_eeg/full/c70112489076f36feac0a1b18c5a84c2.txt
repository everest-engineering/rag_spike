DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a very low voltage, scant, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of bilateral background slowing and a slight amount of shifting asymmetry. Photic stimulation does not active the record.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Mild background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. No significant focal features were noted. This will be used for the patient's long term monitoring baseline.
