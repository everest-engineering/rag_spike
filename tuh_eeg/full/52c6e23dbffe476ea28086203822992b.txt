CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 46-year-old male with right arm numbness and difficulty speaking, noted having twitching on the right side of his mouth.

MEDICATIONS:  Toradol, Protonix, morphine.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard international 10/2020 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10-11 Hz in frequency, seen in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is diffuse low-amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There is no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures seen during this recording.  Heart rate is 54 beats per minute and regular.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal electroencephalogram recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  A normal EEG does not rule out


the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
