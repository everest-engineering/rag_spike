:
History:	38 year old woman with a history of childhood seizures that stopped at 3 yo.
Seizures recurred in 2012.  Seizures are reportedly generalized.
Medications:	Tegretol, Prozac, Sinequan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9-10 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity.
There is expected AP gradient.  Diffuse excess beta activity and polymorphic theta activity are
observed.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
