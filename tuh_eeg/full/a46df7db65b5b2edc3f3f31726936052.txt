CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old male with alcohol withdrawal seizures, 3 tonic-clonic seizures this morning, nonverbal, agitated, restless.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is extremely restless.  He is constantly moving with almost a rotatory motion.  He is difficult to console.  Impedances in this EEG are high and the tech keeps having to readjust the electrolytes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates a slow background with some excess beta seen in some sections of the record but primarily a theta, delta pattern.  Other sections of the record demonstrate some alpha frequency activity, occasional FIRDA was observed.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  The background slowing may be part of this patient's postictal state or another diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
