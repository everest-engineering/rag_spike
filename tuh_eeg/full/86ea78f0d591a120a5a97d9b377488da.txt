CLINICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, MID, confusion
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel 300 mg.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG for an older adult with a hair weave.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, and a small amount of frontal theta.  Occasionally, as the patient drifts off to sleep, there is some underlying subtle focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region.  The patient transitions in and out of drowsiness with hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to,
Mild background theta.
Intermittent focal slowing from the left temporal region noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted.  The intermittent theta and drowsiness may be correlated with this patient's imaging.  Given the degree of cognitive impairment, the overall background is quite unremarkable.
