CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male admitted to the hospital on March 8, 2011 with intraventricular hemorrhage, now confused and inattentive. Past history of polysubstance abuse and mental illness.
MEDICATIONS: Serax, Lisinopril, Protonix, Hydralazine, Thiamine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG includes a great deal of muscle movement artifact. The patient is quite inattentive and moving about. The overall background is relatively low voltage with low voltage theta. Features of drowsiness include an overall attenuation. Snoring produces arousals and muscle artifact. Brief spindle activity is noted and there is a glimpse of stage 2 sleep, followed by an arousal with a theta frequency background.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively low voltage slow theta pattern in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are prominent snore arousals in this relatively slender adult. Consideration for an underlying sleep disturbance contributing to his impaired mental status may be of value.
