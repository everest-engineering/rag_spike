CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 35-year-old woman who first presented with seizures in 2012, seizures recurred in 2014. Seizures may begin with an aura, previously described as twitching on the right, head turning to the left, falls, becomes paralyzed on the right, with tongue biting and foaming of the mouth, followed by drowsiness and right eye twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm reaching 70 microvolts, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Microsleeps are noted with brief dropouts of the alpha rhythm and very brief epochs of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and K complexes.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  The patient was dropping in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual who completed previous routine and 3 days of continuous video EEG monitoring.  None of the studies have demonstrated epileptiform activity. Microsleeps were noted today, may be due to sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disturbance.
