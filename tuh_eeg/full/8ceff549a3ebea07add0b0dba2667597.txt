History:	55 YO MALE WITH A FALL ON 4/16/14 AFTER BEING ATTACKED BY DOG. LEFT
HIP PAIN RESULTED IN S/P OF FEMUR FRACTURE. ADMITTED TO TUH REHAB
4/24/14. PMHX: ETOH
Medications:	keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 7Hz theta  in wakefulness  During brief drowsiness, the
alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR 90-100
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
