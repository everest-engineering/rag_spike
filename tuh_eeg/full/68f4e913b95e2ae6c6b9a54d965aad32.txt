Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10Â·20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was disorganized and was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with of the expected to gradient of frequencies. There were intermittent bifrontal sharply-contoured high voltage delta and theta activity with no evolution. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was reactivity to painful stimuli. HR was 110.
