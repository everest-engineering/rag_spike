CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old female status post left subarachnoid aneurysm repair with cranioplasty, here for check up to get her driver's license back.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Hydrochlorothiazide, Levothyroxine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Follow up seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta seen.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep. Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at T3 intermittently.
Focal slow waves seen continuously at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV with an associated breech rhythm in this region.  At times they become monomorphic during the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal sharp waves.
Continuous focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is consistent with a known hemorrhage and surgery.  No seizures were seen.
