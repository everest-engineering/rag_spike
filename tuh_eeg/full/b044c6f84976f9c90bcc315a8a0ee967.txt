CLINICAL HISTORY: 92 year old female found unresponsive with "eye gaze," found to
be hypothermic, possible seizure 5-6 months ago, cerebral atrophy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lisinopril, Synthroid, ASA, Cefepime, Zithromax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20'
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is examined and
stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an almost
monotonous lower voltage theta pattern with superimposed frontally predominant
triphasic waves and a handful of bilateral generalized periodic complexes. Stimulation
of the patient on occasion seems to produce an attenuation of the background. The
majority of the triphasic waves are bilateral but some are asynchronous. There also
seems to be an underlying sharp waves focus at T6. Following the administration of
Ativan there is increasing theta frequency activity. The EEG ends 8 minutes after the
administration of Ativan, and the Ativan did appear to alter the record producing an
increase in slowing noted in the final 2 minutes of the record .
HR: 70 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Triphasic waves.
2. Generalized periodic complexes.
3. Right mid and posterior temporal sharp waves.
4. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the response to Ativan, additional EEG
recording is recommended to help determine if all of the waveforms described above
are toxic-metabolic in nature versus epileptiform.
