History:	53 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O EVENT NOTED OF SHAKING OF LIMBS
DURING STIMULATION, EEG TO R/O SZ. PMHX SIG FOR SARCOID, COPD, DM,
A FLUTTER-A FIB.6-5-15 CEREBRAL EDEMA
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by almost
complete attenuation of all cerebral activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  There are infrequent 1 second burst of low amplitude theta with at time
frontal predominant sharp waves.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare generalized
Attenuation, nearly continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background attenuation, rare bifrontal sharps
and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are consistent with a severe diffuse cortical injury.  These
findings are slightly worse than the previous EEG and are suggestive of a worsening cortical
