History:	77 YO FEMALE TO ED WITH SLURRED SPEECH AND RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS.

PMHX: A - FIB, SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, DM, HTN.
Medications:	KEPPRA, INSULIN, XARELTO, BUMEX, PROTONIX, ENALAPRIL, METOPROLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  hemispheric asymmetry was seen with continuous, polymorphic delta activity and loss
of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, most pronounced in the posterior quadrant region.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Spontaneous variability and reactivity
to stimulation were noted.  HR 100  EMG and movement artifact were noted in the right leads.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, bilateral generalized
Attenuation, bilateral (R>L) diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In
addition,  continuous focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant with attenuation and loss of faster
frequencies.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural cortical lesion in this region, consistent
with the patient's history of ischemic stroke.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG
does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
