CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old male with epilepsy following subarachnoid hemorrhage, recurrent hospitalizations for seizures due to noncompliance.  Left frontotemporal encephalomalacia.  The patient transferred from Episcopal Hospital after status epilepticus requiring phenytoin load and propofol drip.
Medications: phenytoin  and propofol drip.
INTRODUCTION:  The 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a low voltage, continuous pattern with very low voltage beta and delta.  The overall pattern is relatively symmetric with subtle eye movement artifact.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produces grimace with muscle artifact, but no true arousal.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Excess beta.
Paucity of reactivity to external stimuli.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG is most supportive of pharmacologic coma at this time. EEG monitoring will be performed to access subclinical seizures
