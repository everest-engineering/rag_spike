CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old left handed woman with a seizure 1 year ago, currently
seizure free.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, lipitor, Losartan. Amlodipine
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake
and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD
In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8 to 8.3 hertz alpha
rhythm with a small amount of low voltage. frontocentral beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness,
there is rhythmic left temporal theta which is prominent. often increasing in bursts. Left temporal
sharp waves are also noted in these bursts. There are bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic mixed
theta and delta noted in relaxed wakefulness. The patient is responsive to commands during
these bursts. The patient remains awake and alert throughout the bursts. Brief drowsiness is
characterized by background slowing. The patient is having bursts of rhythmic temporal theta
which are paroxysmal in nature during photic stimulation, but there is no clear impairment of
awareness. These are sometimes associated with high amplitude T1/T3 sharp waves.
HR: 60 bpm
Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal rhythmic theta and delta, a.k.a., TIRDA.
2. High amplitude left temporal T1 and T3 sharp waves and spikes.
3. Left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative focus in the left temporal
region. The features are quite characteristic of a left temporal lobe epilepsy. Although the
patient was clinically asymptomatic, additional observation is essential to make sure that there
are not subtle missed underlying seizures.
