History:	48 year old man admitted with left parietal ICH/ SAH.  A recent twitching episode
was observed.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess theta activity is captured.
During extensive drowsiness, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL briefly awake and mostly drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
