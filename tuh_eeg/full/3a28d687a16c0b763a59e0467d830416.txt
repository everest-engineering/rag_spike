History:	58 YEAR OLD FEMALE HAD AN EPISODE WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.
DAUGHTER STATES NO CONVULSIONS, EYES WERE OPEN AND PT BEGAN TO
MUMBLE. SHE WAS UNRESPONSIVE
Medications:	PLAVIX, LIPITOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Intermittent, diffuse, 5-7Hz activity and associated disorganization is
present throughout the recording  Intermittent, brief (2-5 second) bursts of 80-150uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic
bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse,
shifting background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving.  HR 60  Technical difficulty: impedance issues with T2 electrode
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, moderate
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild other, shifting slowing during HV
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake only due to 1. FIRDA  2. Subtle shifting slowing and
disorganization  3. Shifting slowing in hyperventilation  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
