History:	39 yo right handed female with seizures lasting up to 1 min with associated loss of
consciousness and urinary incontinence occurring 2x a week.
Medications:	Clonazepam, Fluoxetine, Doxepin, Prazosin, Lithium Carbonate,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 20-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
