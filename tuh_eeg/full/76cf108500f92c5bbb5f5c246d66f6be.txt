HISTORY:  A 70-year-old male with a history of multiple AVMs, started on Depakote now with elevated Depakote level, encephalopathy and diabetes out of control.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, lisinopril, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  This was a technically challenging EEG, particularly in the later sections, as the patient does seem to have difficulty keeping his electrodes on.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  Initially, the background EEG is somewhat slow but as the recording continues, a more clearly defined 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was noted.
Intermittent left focal slowing was noted primarily in drowsiness.
Interictal epileptiform detections:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  60 to 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This was a somewhat technically challenging EEG monitoring session but it was remarkable for:
A pattern of background slowing which seemed to improve over time.
In this technically challenging EEG, intermittent focal slowing noted infrequently from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  If additional information is needed, a followup study when the patient's metabolic and pharmacologic issues resolve may be of value.  There were no previous EEGs available for comparison at this time.
