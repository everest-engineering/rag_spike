History:	56 YR MALE WITH CC OF NAUSEA AND VOMITING. NEURO CONSULTED FOR
LEFT SIDE WEAKNESS. X 1WK..  PMHX: SZ, TIA, DM, HTN, CVA.  NON
COMPLIANT TO MEDS.
Medications:	INSULIN, METOPROLOL, KEPPRA, FUROSEMIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 region.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
