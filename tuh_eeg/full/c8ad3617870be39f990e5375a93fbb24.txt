REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with ataxia for several days found to have a right-sided subacute subdural hemorrhage, witnessed seizure, episode of left gaze, and facial twitching which lasted sometime.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Depakote, Protonix, zonisamide, Cymbalta, Prozac, lamotrigine, nicotine patch.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is slightly attenuated over the right hemisphere and slowed over the left hemisphere.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient did appear to go to sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There is attenuation of the frequencies over the right hemisphere, however, there appears to be some fast beta seen and some normal frequencies seen over that region.
There is focal slowing over the left hemisphere, maximal at T3 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right hemispheric attenuation in addition to left hemispheric focal slowing, maximal in the mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction over the left hemisphere, maximal in the mid temporal region, which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, the attenuation seen over the right hemisphere may be easily explained by the recent subdural collection.  No clear determination can be made about cortical damage to that region.  No sharp waves or epileptiform discharges were seen.
