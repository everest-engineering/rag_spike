CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with intermittent episodes of a strange feeling without loss of consciousness or seizure-like activity. These symptoms occur 3 times per week. No other neurologic problems. No history of closed head injury.
MEDICATIONS: Ethosuximide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation produces both head rocking artifact and some background slowing. Minimal drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. The vigorous driving response is a normal phenomenon.
