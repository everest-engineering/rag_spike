CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 46-year-old male with epilepsy since birth, but seizure free for the past 3 years.  Previously, seizure-free for 10 years.  Past history of birth defect and past history of wheelchair use.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG, capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep, with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There was a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In relaxed wakefulness and in the transition to sleep, there is prominent occipital rhythmic theta.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep.  Minimal driving was noted.
Heart rate 60 of bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 40-minute digital video EEG was within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The rhythmic occipital theta in the transition to sleep is not an epileptogenic finding.
