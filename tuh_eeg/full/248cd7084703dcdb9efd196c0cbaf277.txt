CLINICAL HISTORY:   67 year old right handed woman with change in mental status and respiratory infection with a fever of 101.8.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Vancomycin, Acyclovir.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some normal frontocentral beta.  The patient remains in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
At times, there are intermittent bursts of monomorphic frontally predominant delta consistent with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is not specific with regards to etiology.  However, in this case it may be due to a metabolic and/or medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
