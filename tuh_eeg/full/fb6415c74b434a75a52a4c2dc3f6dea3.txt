CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed male admitted in August for syncope.  Past history of auditory hallucinations, evaluate for change of mental status on September 12th .
MEDICATIONS:  Novolin, Oxycodone, Ambien, Percocet, Lovenox, Protonix
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was noted to have some involuntary oral automatisms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there are sections of the record with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is excess theta.  In relaxed wakefulness and as the patient transitions into drowsiness, there are bursts of relatively rhythmic mixed theta-delta.  Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background theta and generalized background slowing is a little bit more prominent than the August 31ST  study.  Consideration for a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy would be appropriate.
