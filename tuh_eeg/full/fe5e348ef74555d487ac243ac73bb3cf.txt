CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 53-year-old woman with past hemispherectomy, progressive left-sided weakness, and encephalopathy, admitted today after multiple seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow bilaterally with an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The activity on the right hemisphere is relatively low voltage and suppressed.  The activity on the left demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity with some of which is sharply contoured with a high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves.  The patient appears to be relatively drowsy throughout the EEG with some muscle movement.  High amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes were noted in the background.  Features of deeper stages of sleep include an increase in beta.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Marked interhemispheric asymmetry with marked suppression on the right.
A slow pattern on the left with occasional sharp waves on the left,
Left high amplitude spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to previous studies demonstrating a very suppressed pattern on the right and epileptiform activity on the left.  No seizures were recorded.
