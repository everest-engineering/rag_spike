CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old left handed woman with menstrual epilepsy, nocturnal convulsions during the first weeks of her menstrual cycle.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was attempted in lab standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has great difficulty cooperating with the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is lacking any of the normal morphologies for an adult of this age.  There is the suggestion of some sharp activity at P4; however, there are so many electrode problems that the EEG is of limited value.  Even the EKG lead did not stay on.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is quite technically limited but is remarkable for paucity of normal wave forms.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A repeat study, allowing the individual to fall asleep as well as wrapping the head to secure the quality of the electrodes is advised.
