History:	61 YR OLD FEMALE  PMHX.BIPOLAR,ETOH ABUSE,DEPRESSION,LEFT SIDED
WEAKNESS.
Medications:	Keppra, Morphine, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a PDR that at best reaches 8Hz.  Background activity is
predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.
There are few short one to two second periods of diffuse attenuation .  No normal sleep architecture
was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
