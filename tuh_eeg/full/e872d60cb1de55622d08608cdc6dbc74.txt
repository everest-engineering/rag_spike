CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed woman with a history of epilepsy since infancy, tonic-clonic seizures with tongue biting. History of PTSD last seizure 6/2/2010. Seizures are associated with an aura of a rushing sensation to her head.
MEDICATIONS: Tramadol, Celexa, Citalopram
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm is significantly amplitude on the right compared to the left. Hyperventilation produces bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and a single left burst of left temporal slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta. There is some head rocking movement in sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. An alpha rhythm which is at the limits of normal in terms of amplitude asymmetry.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this record. Additional EEG recording may be helpful to capture this patient's typical spells.
