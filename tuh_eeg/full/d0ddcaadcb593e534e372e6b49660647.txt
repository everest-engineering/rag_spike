History:	71 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P AVR 8/18/14, CT SHOWED
PONTINE BLEED, SUSPECTED THORACIC SPINE ABSCESS/// MRSA
Medications:	HEPARIN, LEVOPHED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some central
beta was seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Some state changes can be noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
