CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old male admitted with acute left subdural hematoma, syncope, previous MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, Zofran
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible in this critical care record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern from the right with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The activity on the left is slower with a mixture of theta and delta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  There is some more rhythmic slowing on the left occipital temporal region.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left involving gray and white matter.
