Medications: Gabapentin, Keppra
Sedation:
None
EEG Type: Routine, awake &drowsy, portable
Technique: International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes, awake. lethargic
The waking background is well-organized, with a 25-40uV, 6-7Hz symmetric alpha rhythm. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. No steep was recorded.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. During the entire record there Is a marked pacemaker artifact seen over the temporal and frontal regions bilaterally. The artifact impedes the proper evaluation of the Involved areas in the record.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a limited ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse moderate background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
