CLINICAL HISTORY:  Reason for study:  Rule out seizures.

A 38-year-old man status post liver transplant due to alcohol cirrhosis now presenting with a change in mental status.

MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone, Albumin, and Rifaximin.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system as well as __________ anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness only.  Activating procedures were not performed.

Technical difficulties:  Continuous movement artifact throughout the recording.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7.5 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  Some frontocentral beta is seen.  No sleep is recorded.  No activating procedures are performed.

Please note again, during the recording there is marked movement artifact throughout.

Abnormal discharges:
Generalized slow-waves at 5-7 Hz with amplitudes of 20-50 microvolts.  __________  throughout the recording.

Seizures:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slow-waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
