CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 40-year-old woman with 1-year onset of seizures, past history of cocaine abuse. Cerebral angiogram with cocaine related vasculitis.  Frontal gliosis. P patient admitted on the 24th with temperature of 102, WBC count 17, and repetitive staring spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, oxcarbazepine, Tylenol, phenobarbital, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 21-channel digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was awake but somewhat confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a dynamic pattern.  There are some sections of the record, which modestly disorganized with a theta frequency background.  Other sections of the record include bursts of rhythmic delta or semirhythmic delta activity noted from the frontal regions, right more so than the left.  When the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in theta activity and a suggestion of a beta buzz in the right frontocentral region.
The patient is confused while awake during the EEG but without a significant clinical change.
Heart rate:  50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal bedside EEG due to:
A markedly slow background.
Bursts of rhythmic or semirhythmic delta, right more so than the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  These findings may be correlated with imaging and clinical parameters.  LTM will follow for this patient with altered MSE.
