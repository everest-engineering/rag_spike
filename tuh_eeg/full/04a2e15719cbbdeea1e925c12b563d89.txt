History:	28 YEAR OLD MALE RIGHT HANDED WITH SEIZURES SINCE NOV 2013 WHEN
ASSAULTED BY PHILA POLICE DEPARTMENT  STAPLES IN HEAD 13. NOW WITH
TWITCHING. NO INCONTINENCE NO TONGUE BITING. BUT LOC.POST ICTAL
SLEEPY. PT STATES THEY OCCUR 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK.
Medications:	none
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
