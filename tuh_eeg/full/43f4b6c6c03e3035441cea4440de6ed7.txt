CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 87-year-old man with a history of status post motor vehicle accident with multiple fractures and a right frontal subdural hemorrhage.
Also a bilateral cerebellar and as well as left PCA strokes.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, Protonix, Lipitor, metoprolol, Unasyn, Lasix, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is some faster frequency seen over the right central region than seen over the left.  There appears to be no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing seen continuously over the left hemisphere at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously.  However, over the right hemisphere there is some slightly higher beta that cannot be seen over the left.
Heart rate 72.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing and loss of faster frequencies.
Generalized slowing at a frequency of 2-4 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known lesion.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The EEG does show some reactivity with stimulation.
