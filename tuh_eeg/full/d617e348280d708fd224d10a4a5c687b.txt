CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old right handed woman with a past medical history of concussion in high school as well as diabetes type 1 presents with episodes of waking up, feeling strange and acting strange with an electric shock in her head.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Spironolactone, Birth control pills.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz and 20-60 microvolts amplitude, which is reactive to eye opening and closing.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1 with frequent rounds of vertex waves.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation do not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude
the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Prolonged recording may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
