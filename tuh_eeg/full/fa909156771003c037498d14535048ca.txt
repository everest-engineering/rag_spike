CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old gentleman transferred from an outside hospital on the 7th following dead bowel, status post subtotal colectomy, recurrent acute abdomen. Exploratory laparoscopy on the 10th. Right MCA stroke on the 17th. Evaluate for subclinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Piperacillin, Tazobactam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency, slow pattern. The overall pattern is relatively low voltage. Superimposed upon this are intermittent bursts of bilateral delta and some focal delta, particularly in the right posterior quadrant. Some of this is sharply contoured at P6 and O2. The overall record is variable and reactive and some sections of the record, particularly with stimulation, include alpha frequency activity. On rare occasions there is a well-defined O2 sharp wave.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing at some points quite remarkable.
Focal slowing.
Right occipital sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted. Most of the epileptiform features described above are posterior and may be correlated with imaging.
