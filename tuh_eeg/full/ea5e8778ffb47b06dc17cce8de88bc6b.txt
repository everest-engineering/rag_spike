History:	50 year old woman with a history of tuberous sclerosis.
Medications:	TOPIRAMATE, CLONAZEPAM PRN, LAMOTRIGINE, TRAMADOL, STRATTERA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Rare polymorphic polymorphic theta activity is captured over the right midtemporal region.
Several moderate amplitude right midtemporal sharp waves are noted.  Maximal scalp negativity
occurs over the T4 electrode.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, few, right temporal, mid, over T4 lead
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, mild, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG due to rare mild right midtemporal focal
slowing and several right midtemporal epileptiform discharges These findings are indicative of a
focal right midtemporal structural lesion with epileptogenic potential.
