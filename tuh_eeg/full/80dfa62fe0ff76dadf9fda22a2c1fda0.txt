EEG REPORT
Clinical HISTORY: 56 year old woman with hepatic failure, alcohol abuse, hepatitis
C, hypothyroidism, encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Ativan, Midodrine, Albumin, Lorazepam, Pantoprazole,
Mycamine, rifaximin, Lasix, Solumedrol, Norepinephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and
described as easily agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively
low voltage mixed frequency pattern with generous beta, slow delta, and smaller
amounts of rhythmic 6.3 Hz activity. The delta activity is 0.5 to 1 Hz. In this bedside
recording, there is a bit of head-rocking artifact but no definitive slowing in the right
occipital region.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Marked background slowing.
2. Mixed frequency background with intermittent generous beta and some rhythmic
theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. This EEG is
compatible with pharmacologic sedation and an underlying metabolic pattern although it
is a nonspecific pattern.
