CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old male, status post gunshot wound x4 including left cheek, right shoulder, right ear.  Asystolic on arrival to another hospital and transferred to this hospital on unknown date, now with myoclonic twitching of the right shoulder.  Previously loaded with Depakote.  It looks like the gunshot wounds were sometime before the 13th.

MEDICATIONS:  Potassium, Metoprolol, Labetalol, Lovenox, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Valproic Acid

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG pattern demonstrates a low voltage, featureless pattern.  There is variability noted in later sections of the record.  There is a spontaneous brief burst of triangular shaped, frontal sharp waves without definitive frequency evolution.  Following this, there is a little more rhythmic theta and faster delta frequency activity.  This is seen a little bit more spontaneously. Tactile stimulation of the patient did not activate the record, but it did seem to elicit a little bit of eye movement.

HR:    120 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A markedly low voltage and suppressed pattern.
2. A brief burst of frontal sharp waves, maximum at the midline.
3. Absence of reactivity or variability.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  In comparison to the first study, this EEG is markedly slower.  No twitching was observed.  No seizures were observed.
