CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed male with depression, epilepsy, dilantin toxicity, psychosis, hallucinations, and third degree burn on the top of the feet.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Depakote, Ativan, Risperdal, Valproic Acid.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake study in an anxious patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkable for generous beta. Drowsiness is characterized by some theta. There are brief sections of the record where a 9 Hz alpha rhythm can be identified, but much of the waking record includes excess beta.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent excess beta.
2. Scant amount of theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The features described above may be associated with this patient's medications. If epilepsy is an important consideration, consider repeat study when the patient is out of the ICU.
