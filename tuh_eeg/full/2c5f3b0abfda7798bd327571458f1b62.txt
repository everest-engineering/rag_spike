CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of seizures since 5 months of age.  He remained seizure-free for 9 years, but the seizures resumed 1 year ago in sleep.  The most recent seizure was in March 2013 during which he was shaking and was unarousable.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with one channel of EKG.  The EKG was recorded in awake, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  T4 electrode artifact was noted throughout a significant period of the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 10.5 Hz and 20-50 microvolts in amplitude.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.
A normal frontal central beta rhythm is noted.
Stage I and stage II sleep was achieved during the recording.  Stage II was characterized by vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation was performed, which elicited diffuse slowing and increase in amplitude.
Photic stimulation was performed, which did not bring about any changes in the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  A single burst of right mid temporal slowing was noted.  There were no focal sharp waves or spikes noted.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  The single burst of right midtemporal slowing is of nonspecific clinical significance.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Clinical correlation recommended.
