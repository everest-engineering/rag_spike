Medications: Labetalol, Morphine, K-dur, Insulin drip
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System, standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There are spontaneous variability and stimulation reactivity of the background activity. HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Finding:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse
Interpretation:
This Is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific Indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Clinical correlation Is recommended.
