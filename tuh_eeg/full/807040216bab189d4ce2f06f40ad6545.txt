History:	45 year old man undergoing aortic repair, aortic valve replacement and a cardiac
bypass.

This is intraoperative EEG monitoring.
Medications:	Anesthesia, rocuronium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Patient is awake at the beginning of the procedure with normal background.  Once general
anesthesia is initiated, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity
with occasional periods of discontinuity.  This background is observed for the duration of the
recording.  P4 and O2 leads are dislodged around 9:30 am and they remain as such for the rest of
the recording.  At ~ 12:06 am, 4 Hz monomorphic activity appears in P4 and O2 leads.  This
activity persists without change until ~ 12:25 PM and resolves spontaneous.  It reappears
occasionally throughout the rest of the recording.  This activity is artifactual in  etiology.  T3 lead
too becomes faulty by the end of the recording.  Circulatory bypass is initiated twice during the
procedure: from ~10:05 am till ~1:18 am and from ~1:33 pm till ~2:07 pm.  The background
remains grossly symmetrical throughout the procedure.  Right hemispheric lead artifact overall limit
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable ~7 hour continuous intraoperative monitoring, with ~4 hours of direct live
remote EEG monitoring and ~15 minutes of monitoring inside the OR.
