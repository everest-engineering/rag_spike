DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a slow alpha rhythm at 7.6 Hertz. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. This is followed by beta frequency activity. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not clearly activate the record.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific but the rhythmic background slowing described above is a well recognized pattern in Alzheimer type dementia, although it can be seen in dementia of many other etiologies.
