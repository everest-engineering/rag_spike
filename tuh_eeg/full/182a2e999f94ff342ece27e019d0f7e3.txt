CLINICAL HISTORY: 85 year old right handed male with 2 seizures for which he is amnestic. Multiple comorbidities. The patient reported to the technologist that he was taking Keppra, but to his physician that he is not.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lipitor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is quite well organized for an adult of this age. There is an alpha rhythm, 8.3 to 8. 7 Hz, higher amplitude on the left than the right with some slight asymmetries in terms of the frequency of the alpha comparing the right to the left. Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slight asymmetry of the alpha rhythm and scant slowing of the alpha rhythm for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. In view of the magnitude of his previous cerebrovascular disease, the epileptiform features described above are quite subtle.
