CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed male with a seizure in August 2008,
none following resection of a frontal meningioma.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10.20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred
but photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation was not
performed. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. As the patient
becomes drowsy, there is theta activity noted in the frontocentral regions in the patient's breech rhythm In the frontal region is a bit more prominent. Vertex waves are seen In stage I sleep. Posts are noted in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep. There is a subtle asymmetry at that time with a bit of slowing in the left central region compared to the right.

HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing in the left central region in drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with a recent craniotomy, these are
anticipated findings. There were no epileptiform features noted.
