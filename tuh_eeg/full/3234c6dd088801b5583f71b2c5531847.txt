EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at higher amplitudes over
the left hemisphere.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of theta, delta,
beta, with unstable 8-9 Hz PDR and weak AP gradient.  No normal background organization is
present over the left.  The background on the left consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta
and delta admixed with underriding fast activity and continuous  Patient remains awake
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left posterior quadrant during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent high amplitude almost periodic posterior temporal (T5)
more than left parietal (P3) sharp waves are seen.  14 clinical seizures and 1 electrographic are
captured, lasting ~60-140 seconds.  Electrographically seizures start with left parietal beta
discharge that spreads over the posterior temporal leads and over the left hemisphere increasing in
amplitude and decreasing in frequency.  Clinically the patient appears to flex his right arm
Summary of Findings:
Seizure
Sharp waves
Focal slowing, polymorphic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal awake 1 hour EEG due to recurrent 60-140 second clinical and
electrographic focal seizures with left posterior quadrant onset.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing, frequent
epileptiform discharges and seizures emanating from the left posterior temporoparietal region
indicate focal structural lesion.  This EEG remains similar to the previous EEG recorded on
03/05/2014.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
