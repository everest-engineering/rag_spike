CLINICAL HISTORY:	62 year old woman with hallucinations, CHF.


MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Metoprolol, Renagel, ASA, PhosLo


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic simulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. Lambda waves are observed in the background. There is a generous amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity and muscle artifact as the patient is not particularly cooperative. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, occasional vertex waves are observed. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle
driving response.


HR:	96 bpm


IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Lambda waves are a normal phenomenon.
