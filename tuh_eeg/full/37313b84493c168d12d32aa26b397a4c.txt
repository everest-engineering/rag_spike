CLINICAL HISTORY: A 56-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, intracerebral hemorrhage, blindness in the left eye, and previous stroke. The patient now has episodes, in which she falls forward on stairs. No shaking, no loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was relatively somnolent initially, but arousable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG in maximal wakefulness is somewhat disorganized, medium amplitude with a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm present bilaterally approximately 10 Hz. Shifting slowing was noted.  More well defined wakefulness includes somewhat slower alpha of 8.7 hertz, and intermittent theta seen from either hemisphere. Photic stimulation was attempted early in the record and was marred by photoelectric artifact.  This section of the record, which is compromised by photoelectric artifact does, however, demonstrate underlying sharp waves from the left temporal region with sharply contoured slowing. A handful of these bursts of sharply contoured slowing are seen following photic stimulation and after this, the patient drifts off to sleep.
Heart rate: 50 to 60 bpm. IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.  The EEG has technical limitations including the photoelectric artifact, but if this individual is thought to have frequent seizures, EEG monitoring may be of value.
