CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old right handed female with transient global amnesia, question Alzheimer's disease.

MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, Aricept, Atorvastatin

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz 70 mV alpha rhythm.  In the transition to drowsiness there are intermittent bursts of focal slowing, primarily on the left, but on rare occasions on the right as well.  Bursts are primarily arrhythmic delta. Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and a few bursts of FIRDA.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Intermittent paroxysmal bursts of arrhythmic delta from the left or right temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific in an adult of this age, but are most commonly associated with underlying cerebrovascular disease.  Of note, it
was a little bit more prominent on the left initially and on the right at the end of the EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged sleep EEG is suggested.
