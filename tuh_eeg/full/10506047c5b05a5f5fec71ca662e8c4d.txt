CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, seizure-free for several years, depression, B12 deficiency, insomnia and poor memory.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Zonegran, Melatonin, Zoloft.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video 1 hour EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In much of the maximal wakeful record, the background EEG includes an alpha rhythm of 8.7 Hz, but with stimulation, it increases to 10 Hz.  There are some unusual findings in terms of the field of the alpha rhythm.  It has more anterior spread on the right than the left.  Central mu activity is noted and is symmetric.  Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.  The patient has multiple spontaneous arousals from stage 2 sleep.  The field of the spindles is much more posterior than is normally seen. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing as well as scant shifting slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.  The patient is drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a number of minor findings but none that are clearly indicative of pathology.  The asymmetric field for the alpha rhythm is of unclear clinical significance, and the posteriorly field for her spindle activity is not otherwise indicative of pathology.  This EEG contrasts to previous EEGs many years ago which identified an independent, right or left central or parietal sharp waves.
