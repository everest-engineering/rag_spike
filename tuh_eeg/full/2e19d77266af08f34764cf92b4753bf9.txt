History:	48 year old female complains of having seizures in her sleep. Patient can not describe the
seizure, but she wakes up with bite marks and a sore tongue.
Medications:	Simvastatin, 2 inhalers, risperdal, and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by very low amplitude 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is captured.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
of ~60 bpm while awake and <60 bpm while asleep.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could
be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates heart rate of ~60 bpm while awake and <60 bpm while asleep.
