CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old left handed male with history of head trauma, subarachnoid in 2007, status post surgery and seizures.  Last seizure about a year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and aspirin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed on lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Stage I sleep was recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an increased amount of frontal central beta seen and focal slowing in the bilateral frontal regions, as well as a breech rhythm seen.  The patient reaches stage I sleep.
Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen independently at F4 and C3 occasionally.
Focal slow waves seen at F3 and independently at F4 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude 20-70 mV and an associated breech in both regions.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent right frontal and left central sharp waves.
Bi-frontal slowing and breech rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising either from the right frontal left central
region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the bifrontal region, which is consistent with a known trauma.  No seizures were seen.
