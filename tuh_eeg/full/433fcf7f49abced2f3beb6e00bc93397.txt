CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old male with a history of epilepsy since childhood.  The most recent seizure was 1 month ago characterized by eyes rolling backwards, breathing heavily, shaking and loss of consciousness lasting for about 1 to 2 minutes.
past medical history:  Autism, cardiac arrhythmia.
MEDICATIONS:  Divalproate, diltiazem.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  There was a impedance problem at T3-T4 which could not be fixed.  The patient was tense and was unable to relax during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a background rhythm of 9 Hz frequency with an amplitude of 40-70 microvolts which was reactive to eye opening.  The amplitude on the left was slightly higher than the right.  The background was occasionally disrupted because of chewing and muscle artifact.
Sleep was not achieved during the recording.
Photic stimulation elicited driving at intermediate/frequencies.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no focal or generalized epileptiform features noted.  The asymmetry in alpha rhythm is not clinically significant.  We do not have previous EEGs for comparison.  A repeat EEG capturing sleep may be performed to increase the probability of finding epileptogenic activity.
