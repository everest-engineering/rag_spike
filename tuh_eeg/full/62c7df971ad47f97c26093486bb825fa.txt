CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy for the last 7
years, the last seizure a year ago but required a 3-month hospitalization. The patient
hospitalized at Temple although previous EEGs not available.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is relatively
low voltage with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, generous beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by more of a rhythmic theta pattern with some snore arousal.
Hyperventilation produces a slight increase in amplitude of the background. Photic
stimulation is primarily obscured by muscle artifact.
HR: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were observed.
Additional evaluation given the snore artifact and the drowsiness may be appropriate.
