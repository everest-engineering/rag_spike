History:	72 YO MALE Recently DISCHARGED FROM TUH. PRIOR EEG AS IP ON 7/16/2015. HX OF ? SZ IN THE PAST, DEMENTIA, DELIRIUM, AND INTERMITTENT BEHAVIORAL ISSUES.
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
ASA, VALPROIC ACID , LIPITOR, METOPROLOL
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-9Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. During drowsiness , the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region (at times with a more posterior field} during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 66 with some PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent , left temporal, mid, at time with a more posterior field Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonÂ­ specific. In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.   This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically  non
