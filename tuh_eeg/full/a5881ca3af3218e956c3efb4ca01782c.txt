Medications:	PLAVIX, PRILOSEC, PHOSLO, NEURONTIN, PRINIVIL, CARDIZEM, XALATAN, DEXTRAN, COREG, DILANTIN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
