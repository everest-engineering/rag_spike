History:	70 year old woman with a history of seizures, migraines and HTN, now presents with
severe memory loss.
Medications:	Keppra, Trileptal, Tramadol, Namenda
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low-to-moderate amplitude polymorphic 9 Hz alpha
activity.  AP gradient is weak and there is excess theta and beta activity.  During drowsiness, the
alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex
Frequent somewhat rhythmic delta activity is seen frequently over the left temporal region.
Occasional moderate amplitude F7/T1/T3 (left anterior temporal ) sharp waves with aftergoing slow
waves are captured.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left temporal, anterior
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), left temporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, left temporal
Disorganization
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild slow and disorganization,
frequent moderate left temporal slowing that is at times semi-rhythmic/ rhythmic and occasional left
anterior temporal epileptiform discharges. There is mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  There is a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the left
temporal region.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
