History:	24 year old man who presents with events concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Versed this morning in the ED.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
During very brief wakefulness the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
during very brief wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL briefly awake and mostly asleep 23-minute portable EEG due to mild
diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this patient is at least partially secondary to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
