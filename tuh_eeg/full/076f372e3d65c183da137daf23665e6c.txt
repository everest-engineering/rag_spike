History:	93 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED CHANGE. IN MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was at best 6Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
theta activity with presence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the anterior
temporal region during wakefulness.  Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the right
parietal region during wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR of 78 bpm.  There is a continuous bilateral prefrontal myogenic artifact
that limits the interpretation of the record.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right parietal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in
the anterior temporal region and right parietal region.  These findings are indicative of severe
focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. In addition there is  moderated
diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
