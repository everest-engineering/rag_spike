CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed woman with epilepsy of the last 4 year with history of aura of a bad taste in her mouth followed by feeling of dizziness and then tonic clonic activity. Last seizure 2 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10â•–20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age with a 10.7 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Early drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic slowing and the appearance of a left temporal sharp wave, maximum at T1 F7. Hyperventilation accentuates theta frequency activity with some shifting theta, particularly in the temporal regions. As the patient becomes drowsy, again subtle sharp waves are noted in the left anterotemporal region as well as some hypersynchronous rhythmic theta. Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep followed by arousal. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
I. Rare, subtle left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is supportive of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The somewhat asynchronous response to hyperventilation is a nonspecific finding.
