CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unknown female. Seizure in the grocery store and 2 additional seizures in the emergency room.  She responded to 4 mg of Ativan, but remained quite confused.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, PHT, LEV

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had difficulty cooperating, it was a somewhat technically difficult study with suboptimal impedance at T4, T1, T2.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was confused and did not activate the record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is postictal.  She seems to be awake, but confused.  Initially, the pattern is  a diffusely slow delta pattern with more arrhythmic delta and focal slowing from the left hemisphere.  The technologist interacts with the patient, the patient settles down and as she does the pattern on the right remains quite slow with a mixture of delta and theta.  From the left, there is more, sharply contoured delta, higher amplitude pattern and an underlying discrete sharp wave as well as discrete fast activity in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including T3, T1, at 7 and T5.  Semi-rhythmic delta is noted out of the left in association with the epileptiform activity.  The EEG is reviewed at slower paper speed.  The delta waxes and wanes, but does not have clear frequency evolution as would be expected in a seizure.  As the recording continues and the patient begins to drift off to sleep, the activity is a bit more sustained and semi-rhythmic.  The patient demonstrates a spontaneous arousal and periodic activity attenuates a bit.

Following this, the patient is drowsy with some complex motor movements such as shifting in the chair and with purposeful and appropriate use of her upper extremities, but she is quite drowsy.  She responds to her name. She seems to be quite confused picking at her clothes.  Throughout this, she has ongoing, periodic delta with some sharp waves mixed in.  Again, without definitive frequency evolution.

Heart rate is 60 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Slowing on the right.
3. Periodic delta out of the left hemisphere particularly frontocentral and temporal regions.
4. Lower amplitude discrete sharp waves noted on the left.
5. Periodic delta which waxes and wanes to some degree and may represent an ictal pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the team and a plan was made for continuous EEG monitoring.
