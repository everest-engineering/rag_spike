CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old female who is trach'd, history of CVA, history of meningioma, dementia, migraine, hypertension, emphysema, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Xanax, Keppra, Lisinopril, Proair, Temazepam.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness mild unresponsiveness as well as drowsiness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some eye movement artifact with patient movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz with a decreased amount of frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at amplitude of 20-70 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Focal slow waves seen at F7-T3 as well as F8-T4 intermittently throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Independent bilateral anterior frontal and midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral midtemporal and frontal regions in addition to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
