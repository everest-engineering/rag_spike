CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old female presented on 11/10/2011 with a history of
being found down by daughter with diffuse activity and' bladder incontinence. 'Per her
daughter, the patient has multiple episodes of bladder incontinence recently, no
witnessed seizures activity. The patient has been lethargic since episode. No past
medical history of seizures. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and
MS arid arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Dilantin, Labetalol, Pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video was performed -at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Wakefulness was recorded. No
activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record showed the background is diffuse with
delta waves with a frequency of 1 to 2 Hz and amplitude of less than 20 microvolts. No
normal posterior dominant rhythm was seen. No frontocentral beta rhythm activity was
recorded.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow delta waves at 1 to 2 Hz.
2. Triphasic waves in diffuse pattern.
3. Intermittent focal slowing at F7.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slow waves and left frontotemporal,
2. Diffuse slow waves in all leads.
3. Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction
plus mild left frontotemporal cerebral dysfunction both of which are nonspecific with
