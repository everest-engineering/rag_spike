CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old right handed man with history of syncope and loss of consciousness as well as CAD status post CABG, CHF, hypertension, pacemaker, obstructive sleep apnea, anemia, schizophrenia and hyperlipidemia who presents of episodes of loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Olanzapine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrence episodes of syncope.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background, a posterior dominant rhythm that best reaches 7 Hz which is not responsive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts seen continuously.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized slowing.
Right anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
