CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with 1 week of feeling poorly, confusion.  Rash, but no fever or tachycardia.  Evaluate for obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone and acyclovir.  Others Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient was poorly responsive.  With arousal, he would follow 1 or 2 commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of theta and delta activity.  Occasional triphasic waves were noted.  Occasional asterixis was also noted.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produced an arousal with 1 or 2 words and theta frequency activity.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  While the tracing described above is nonspecific, it is most compatible with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
