REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old male with history of head trauma with subsequent seizures since 1986, last seizure one year ago, described as generalized tonic-clonic seizure with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  Here for seizure evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zyprexa, Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and  single EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.   Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at T3 at a frequency of 2-3 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
HEART RATE:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to intermittent left mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
