History:	54 YR OLD FEMALE  WITH H/O EPILEPSY  S/P MVA 1980'S. SEIZURES ARE
WITH LOC, POSTICTAL CONFUSION AND TONGUE BITING. LAST SEIZURE  2
WEEKS AGO.
Medications:	DILANTIN, FENTANYL, DESYREL, TRAZODONE, HYDROXYZINE, ABILIFY,
CELEBREX, NICOTINE PATCH,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Generous beta activity is seen.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes more synchronous..  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
