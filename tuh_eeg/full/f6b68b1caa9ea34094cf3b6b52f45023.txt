CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed woman with anxiety, depression and partial epilepsy who presents with a seizures described as a feeling in the face and a feeling of being asleep, but aware of everything around her.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which reacted to eye opening. There is normal frontocentral beta. The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation with  accentuated focal slowing described below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 much more frequently that F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves see more on the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (left more than right), which is nonspecific in regards to the etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
