CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 40-year-old, right-handed woman with a history of oligodendroglioma, treated with left temporal lobectomy and multiple subpial transections with an episode of speech arrest.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous bedside EEG recording was performed. The patient reported no clinical events and none were identified by the nurses.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The sleep recording is of good quality, but in wakefulness the patient has a fair amount of muscle artifact. In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant, which is sometimes disrupted on the left compared to the right.  There is focal slowing characterized by arrhythmic delta activity and a breach rhythm from the left temporal region with some spread to the centrotemporal region.  Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
In stage II sleep, there are sharp waves identified in the setting of a breach, some of which have a somewhat unusual dipole and are in the anterior temporal as well as central regions.  These are of medium amplitude and occur out of an abnormal background.
HR:  56 to 64 BPM.
