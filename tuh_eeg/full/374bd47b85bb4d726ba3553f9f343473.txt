REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 75-year-old man with change in mental status, history of HIV, and left frontal cranioplasty.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, heparin, Flomax, Plavix, amlodipine, Bactrim, fluconazole, hydralazine, atorvastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and slowed frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded while awake and there appears to be a state change.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 96.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz seen almost continuously radio frequency at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Focal slowing seen in the frontal regions, specifically at FP1 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left prefrontal slowing as well as mild-to-moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left prefrontal region, which is consistent with the known lesion.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
