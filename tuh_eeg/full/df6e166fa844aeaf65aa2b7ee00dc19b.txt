History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON 53 YR MAN WITH SZS. UNCONTROLLED HTN AND SUSPECT LIMBIC ENCEPHALITIS. TREATING WITH STEROIDS
Medications:	DILANTIN, KLONOPIN, STEROIDS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. No sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps} does not produce any effect.  HR is 84
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 40 minute EEG, awake only. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
