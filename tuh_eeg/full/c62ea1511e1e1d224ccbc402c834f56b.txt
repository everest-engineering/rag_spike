CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old right handed female with a history of seizures and COPD found unresponsive and pulseless.  Activity was not obtained for about 10-20 minutes and brought to the ER and found to have myoclonic jerks.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Dopamine, Amiodarone.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.
The patient was comatose during the exam and no activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low voltage slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm and no frontocentral beta.  There was normal sleep activity seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 1-2 Hz with a voltage of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  During the recording, there are intermittent bursts of anterior predominant polyspikes that appear to evolve into theta frequency discharge lasting for about 5-7 seconds.
During these bursts, there is notable movement of the face in the patient.  In between these bursts, the background is suppressed.  They appear to occur at least 20 times within the EEG.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent generalized spikes discharges consistent with myoclonus.
Low amplitude generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals electrical activity consistent with generalized myoclonus, which is usually seen in post anoxic injury, as is the case in this patient.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is also likely due to anoxic injury.  This pattern usually indicates poor prognosis.
