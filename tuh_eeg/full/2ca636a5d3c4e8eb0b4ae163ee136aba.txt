REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status and jerkiness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old man with history of cirrhosis, DVT, thrombocytopenia with change in mental status with jerky movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan p.r.n. and was on an Ativan drip before, albumin, famotidine, Serzone, clindamycin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  The background of the EEG consists of basically a very low amplitude, generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.  At times, there are some intermittent bursts of diffuse theta.  When the patient was stimulated, no clear reaction was seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to severe generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and is maybe due, at least in part, to medication and/or a metabolic dysfunction.  No clear seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
