CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year-old right handed male with epilepsy and headaches.
MEDICATION: Depakote, Propofol, Relpax,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. This a 1 hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by a attenuation of the alpha
with rhythmic central theta. In stage I sleep, POSTS are noted and very brief stage II
sleep includes spindles. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform abnormalities were identified
today. The EEG in 2008 was also a normal study, although older records were not
provided for comparison today.
