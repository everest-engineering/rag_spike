CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old with renal failure, diabetes, change in mental status, evaluate for confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, cefepime, vasopressin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is under a warming blanket and appears to have ventilatory support.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background is diffusely slow and poorly organized with a mixture of arrhythmic delta and rhythmic theta.  Triphasic waves were noted, the majority of which are in the frontal regions.  There are occasional bursts of frontal beta.  Bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity were noted.  There were also some vertex sharp waves noted in the record.  The patient transitions between wakefulness and a drowsy state.
In sleep the vertex waves demonstrate some shifting asymmetries.  The patient seems to be easily arousable with an increase in theta.
Heart rate:  62 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Triphasic waves.
Shifting asymmetries, including shifting vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging, but on the whole are most suggestive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  No seizures were recorded.
