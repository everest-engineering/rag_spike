History: 71 YR MALE S/P PEA CODE 1/13/14 APPROX 4:15AM.  LOST PULSE X3. TOTAL
EVENT 1 HR.  S/P LEFT CCA  ANGIOPLASTY, STENT PLACEMENT, LEFT CEA.  EEG
FOR PROGNOSIS.
Medications:	NOREPINEPHRINE, VASOPRESSIN, INSULIN, VANCOMYCIN, ASA, FAMOTIDINE, PLAVIX, METOPROLOL, CEFEPIME, HEPARIN, CYPROHEPTADINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage slow activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. diffuse EMG and ICU-related artifact were noted throughout the recording.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, other
Technically limited
Attenuation
Artifact, EMG
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY limited EEG because of abundant EMG and ICU-related artifacts. This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and attenuation.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In the setting of anoxic brain injury it is associated with poor prognosis.  Note the patient is tachycardic.
