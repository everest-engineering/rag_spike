History:	54 year old man with a history of seizures for the last 1-2 years.  Last seizure
occurred last month (January 2014).  Patient also has a history of alcohol abuse, in
remission for 3 years.
Medications:	KEPPRA, LISINOPRIL, ASA, CELEXA, HCTZ, FLOMAX, ZOCOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with variable cooperation, and accentuates posterior
dominant rhythm.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 25-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
