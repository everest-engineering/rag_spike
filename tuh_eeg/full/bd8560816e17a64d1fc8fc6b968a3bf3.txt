CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old woman with right intracerebral hemorrhage, status
post ventriculostomy removal, now with right shoulder jerking. History of dementia, renal
insufficiency, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Zosyn, Pantoprazole, Labetalol, Gentamicin, Digoxin, Ancef,
Hydralazine, Ceftriaxone, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very poorly
responsive and has a tracheostomy. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and
includes a rhythmic 4 Hz to 5 Hz pattern with intermittent attenuation of the background.
When the record attenuates, it is a bit more flat, more suppressed or the periods of
attenuation are longer on the right compared to the left. Stimulation of the patient does
not significantly activate the record.
HR: 50 bpm with frequent PVC's.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A discontinuous pattern.
2. A pattern that is sometimes more discontinuous on the right.
3. Primarily a rhythmic theta frequency pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No shoulder twitching was noted although there were
some sections of the record with what seemed to be some eye movement artifacts. This
EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting the right hemisphere
more than the left. No epileptiform features were observed.
