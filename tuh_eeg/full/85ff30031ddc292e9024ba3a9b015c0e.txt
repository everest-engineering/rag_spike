History:	42 year old woman with a history of seizure since 6 months of age.  Last seizure was
on 3/10/2014.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and
subtemporal chain, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional right anterior temporal polymorphic theta activity is noted post-hyperventilation.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces occasional
right anterior temporal polymorphic theta activity during  post-hyperventilation period.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, marked, right temporal, anterior, only seen post-
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to occasional mild right anterior
temporal slowing that is observed only during post-hyperventilation period. This finding suggests
focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges are present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
