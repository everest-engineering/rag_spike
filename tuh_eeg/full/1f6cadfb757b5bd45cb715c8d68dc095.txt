CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old male with bipolar disease, schizophrenia, asthma and epilepsy.  Seizures began at age 15 following head injury.  Tonic-clonic seizures with incontinence and postictal confusion.  Seizure free for 1 year.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Prozac, Haldol, albuterol, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the laboratory using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  The patient had great difficulty cooperating with the test and would not allow the technologist to obtain appropriate impedances.  Impedances were generally below 10 kilo ohms.  He did perform hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  This is a routine outpatient 20-minute EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The tracing demonstrates a pattern with generous beta.  There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, followed by rhythmic central theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.

There are a handful of shifting asymmetries noted in the central regions.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of stage 1 sleep and did not significantly activate the record.

Hyperventilation did not activate the record.

Heart rate:  84 BPM.

IMPRESSIONS:  Technically limited EEG but remarkable for excess beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the technical limitations described above, focal findings described above are of unclear significance.  No sharp waves or spikes were noted.  A repeat tracing if the patient is able to cooperate in the future may be of value.
