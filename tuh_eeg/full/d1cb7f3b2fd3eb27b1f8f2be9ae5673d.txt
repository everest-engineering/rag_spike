CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old gentleman with episodes of bilateral shaking since
April 2009 which have responded to topiramate. Last episode February 2010.

MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Pravastatin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is a 1 hour sleep deprived study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with 9.7 Hz symmetric, reactive alpha rhythm and a small amount of low
voltage frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include background slowing
followed by vertex in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of driving.

HR: 66-90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third, normal EEG for this individual. His
symptoms continue with the use of topiramate, consideration for another diagnosis is
appropriate.
