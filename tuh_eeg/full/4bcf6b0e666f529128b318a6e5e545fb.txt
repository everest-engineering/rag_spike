CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old right handed with a history of a febrile seizure, now with single episode of loss of consciousness and postictal confusion while driving and underlying anxiety disorder who appears to be sleepy.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Zoloft, Xanax.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of frontocentral beta which actually moves diffusely more to the left occipital region at times.  Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures of photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves at T5 and P3, occasionally seen at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
Focal sharp waves seen at T5, infrequently, and one at T3.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal sharp waves and slow waves in the left posterior quadrant.
Excessive beta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left posterior temporal or parietal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the same region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Excessive beta may be due to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
