History:	49 yo for thrombectomy.
Medications:	ETOMIDATE, VERSED, FENTANYL, ISO FLURANE, SUCCINYLCHOLINE,
HEPARIN, EPINEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During the surgery the EEG became progressively slower and more
attenuated. No asymmetry was noted during this time.  No normal sleep architecture was present
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  With hypothermia some sharp
waves are noted prior to attenuation of the EEG.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Cardiac arrest at 9:40 AM. EEG became continuously attenuated at
10:35AM.   Patient background did not return to baseline and remained diffusely slow and
somewhat attenuated at the end of the study. This changes where informed to the surgical team.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful 8 hour EEG during a  pulmonary thrombectomy.
