CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old right handed female treated with Xanax.  Seizure at age 17 and then yesterday an episode with shaking of the body but no loss of consciousness.  She now feels terrible.  She stopped her Xanax 2 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  During the EEG the patient experienced her clinical symptoms characterized by shaking of her legs while awake.  She reports that her legs were jumping.  She had to demonstrate this motor activity to the technologist as it was not readily apparent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta.  The patient is drifting off to stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. Patient was very sleepy. Even after she experienced the event with the feeling as if her legs were jumping at 4:05:19, when unstimulated she was drifting off to sleep again. No epileptiform activity was seen with this behavior. A single benign epileptiform transient of sleep was noted from the right with a low-voltage discrete sharp wave after going slow waves. Hyperventilation was attempted, but the patient did not perform this activity with significant effort.  She was falling asleep, transitioning in and out of stage II sleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
General beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were normal, a single, normal variant, small sharp spikes with sleep was noted from the right.  This patient's typical symptoms were recorded during the EEG and did not have any EEG correlate.
