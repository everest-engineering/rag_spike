CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed woman with question seizure versus stroke.

MEDICATIONS: Plavix, Metformin, Metoprolol, Trileptal, Lisinopril, Simvastatin, ASA, HCTZ, Oxcarbazepine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and an asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat disorganized background with an alpha rhythm ranging from 7.5 to 9 Hz. Central mu rhythm is noted which is actually quite well organized. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, muscle or snore artifact, and some paroxysmal theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous study 2 years ago, this EEG is better organized. There are no spikes or sharp waves. The shifting temporal slowing can be seen in the context of cerebrovascular disease.
