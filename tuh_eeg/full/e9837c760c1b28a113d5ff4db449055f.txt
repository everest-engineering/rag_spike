CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old left handed male, with childhood epilepsy, positive family history of similar episodes with tonic clonic and absence seizure.  Last tonic clonic seizure back recognized June 2009, but with recent absence seizure on the job.  The patient was fired.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes symmetric reactive 9.2 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage II sleep. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation, but a driving response is elicited. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. There is a single burst of paroxysmal frontal activity noted at 4:52 p.m. without a definitive spike and wave complex.  This burst is approximately 4 Hz.

HR:    78 bpm

IMPRESSION:  This EEG must be considered normal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were identified for this individual.  This is the second normal EEG for this patient with a positive history of what seems to be generalized epilepsy.
