CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed male with left subdural hematoma, status post bur hole last week.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Dilantin, Zosyn, Flagyl, Protonix, Metoprolol, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive, but unfortunately has a great deal of muscle artifact.  This EEG is markedly abnormal.  It demonstrates a slow more featureless pattern on the left.  There is complex epileptiform activity with discharge, which appears in the occipital regions involving 01, 02, but with significant spread in the right posterior quadrants.  Epileptiform activity is prominent in the occipital regions.  It is not all entirely identical, sometimes demonstrates a phase reversal and a referential montage.  It is often picked up with a maximum at P3 and then a lower voltage potential that follows in the occipital parietal region on the left and then spreads to the right posterior region.  Other sharp waves demonstrate a more significant involvement in the right frontal regions.  The activity on the left is quite attenuated.   Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity on the right.  Unfortunately stimulation of the patient also produces a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly attenuated activity in the left hemisphere.
Complex epileptiform activity, much of which is in the posterior quadrants, sometimes at P3, but sometimes in the left frontal region or in the right occipital region.
Moderate slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings should be correlated with this patient's imaging as a fluid conduction can attenuated EEG activity.
