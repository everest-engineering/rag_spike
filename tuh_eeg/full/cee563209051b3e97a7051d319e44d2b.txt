History:	57 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF CVA , SEIZURES, HTN, DEPRESSION. EVAL TO
WEAN KEPPRA.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PROZAC, REMERON, BACLOFEN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which is best seen on the
left.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and sleep spindles seen best on the left.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the mid
temporal region with associated loss of faster frequencies.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, maximal in the mid temporal region
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right hemisphere maximal in the mid-temporal region with associated loss of faster frequencies.
This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and consistent with the known
