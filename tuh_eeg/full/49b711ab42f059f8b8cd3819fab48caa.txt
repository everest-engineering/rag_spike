CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old right handed female with 1 episode of generalized tonic clonic activity with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  Her medical history is significant for severe headache, short term memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  Awake record, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep records were seen.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is symmetric reactive to opening and posterior dominant alpha rhythm is present at 9 Hz with frequency of 22-70 microvolt amplitude.  Beta rhythm is also seen with 15-25 Hz frequency and 10-15 microvolt amplitude in the frontal central region in small amounts.  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep records are also seen. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are normal.  There is focal slowing noted at F8, T4, and T4 electrodes of 2-4 Hz frequency and 20-70 microvolt amplitude, however, seen occasionally.  No seizures are seen.
HR:  N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional focal slowing seen in the right mid and anterior temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the right temporal lobe which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
