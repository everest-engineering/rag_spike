CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with hypertension, migraine, hyperlipidemia, and with staring spells lasting 2-3 minutes 3-4 times a week.  The patient is aware of her surroundings but cannot speak.

MEDICATIONS:  unknown

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory routine outpatient EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Intermittent focal slowing is noted from the left mid temporal region.  In addition, in relaxed wakefulness, there are occasional, left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves noted.  These have a slightly variable field of spread maybe central temporal or anterior temporal, but are occasionally posterior temporal.  The amplitude of the discharges ranges from 30 to 70 microvolts as well.  Using an average reference, there also appears to be a horizontal dipole for the epileptiform discharges.  They are accentuated by drowsiness.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in theta.

Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a scant driving response.  The epileptiform discharges were noted as the patient became drowsy around the time of photic stimulation but photic stimulation did not otherwise accentuate the discharges.

Heart rate 72 BPM.

IMPRESSIONS:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, infrequent left temporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves noted from the left temporal region with variable maximum including central temporal or temporoparietal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to a previous study performed last year.  If a copy of that report is needed, please call 215-707-4523.
