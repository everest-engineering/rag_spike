REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 79-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension, dementia, here with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, Protonix, insulin, Heparin, Clonazepam, Seroquel, Donepezil and Temazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness stage I sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, as described previously.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
