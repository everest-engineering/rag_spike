History:	63 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS AND
LETHARGY X 1 WEEK, 4MOS. POST KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.
Medications:	NO AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant reaches at best 7 Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
During sleep the background attenuates and slows down even more. There are prominent vertex
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 60 and irregular with some
PAC's and PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  nearly continuous  focal slowing in the central region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
