CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 13.  Tonic-clonic seizures which increased while pregnant.  Patient has auras with fingertips becoming numb, fuzzy visual scintillations.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, prenatal vitamins, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute record with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  The patient seemed to be anxious and had a great deal of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts.  The waking record includes a great deal of muscle artifact.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 106 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Previous EEGs are not available at this time.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.  Of note, the patient demonstrates tachycardia.
