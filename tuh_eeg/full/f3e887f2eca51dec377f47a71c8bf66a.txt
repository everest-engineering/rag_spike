CLINICAL HISTORY:  New onset seizures for the last year with nocturnal tonic clonic seizures with tongue biting, no incontinence.  Last seizure was July 4.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and zonisamide.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was a 1 hour EEG captured in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  Adequate technical competencies were achieved.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta.  Vertex waves, K complexes and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.

Hyperventilation produces rhythmic background slowing.

Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 75 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal 1 hour EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third normal EEG for this adult.  Additional sleep-deprived recording or more prolonged overnight recording may be essential to characterize this patient's epilepsy.
