CLINICAL HISTORY:  Young woman with asthma, status post cardiac arrest on the 21st.
MEDICATIONS:  Vecuronium, Dilantin, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was treated with vecuronium briefly.  She also received Dilantin load.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern.  There are brief bursts of sharply contoured activity identified asynchronously in the right or left frontal regions.  Most bursts are 3 seconds, a few longer such as 7 seconds. There is some variability in the bursts.  Over time, the bursts are becoming a little bit more broader contoured and the sharp waves noted initially are less prominent.  The overall background remains suppressed with ventilator artifact.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for:
A burst suppression pattern.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
Broadening of the sharp waves noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   These findings may be correlated with server anoxic injury.
