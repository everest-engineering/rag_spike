CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old female with a change in mental status. She is status post single seizure last about 7 minutes currently in postictal state. The past medical history is significant for hypertension, seizures and CVA.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Diltiazem, Simvastatin, Klor-Con, Calcium, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Furosemide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. This is a mostly asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the background of this EEG demonstrated mild generalized slowing, there is a slow alpha rhythm of 8 Hz, slower on the right, especially on the right. Blunted, independent right or left frontal sharp waves are seen
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Alpha is slower on the right than on the left for about 6 Hz on the right and measuring for about 8 Hz on the left.
3. Blunted sharp waves in the right or left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is non-specific which could be due to Tegretol toxicity/multi-infarct dementia. The blunted sharp waves on the right and left may be the mechanism for seizures.
