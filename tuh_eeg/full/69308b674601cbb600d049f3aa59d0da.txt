CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with epilepsy for the last year and chronic pain. Patient admitted for severe headaches and multiple tonic clonic seizures on October 17, 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Percocet, Ativan, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is asleep throughout much of the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient is transitioning in and out of stage I and stage II sleep. with spindles, K-complexes and POSTS and then arousals. There is an awake pattern with eye movement and lambda, but excess theta. As the recording continues, additional better defined stage II sleep with high amplitude K-complex is noted. In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8-9 hertz alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response despite the fact that the patient is transitioning into stage II sleep.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG in this excessively drowsy patient is remarkable for:
A slow background.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing described above could be due to this patient's medications or postictal state. Of note, this is the second EEG without
epileptiform activity and if additional information is needed,  an EEG monitoring session may be appropriate.
