History:	64 year old man with a recent SAH, now with worsening mental status.
Medications:	no AEDs listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~19 hours from 11/3/2015 till 11/4/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation, the background consists of attenuated
polymorphic delta activity and large amount of EMG artifact.  During periods of quiescence, the
degree of diffuse theta activity increases.  During periods of sleep, the background consists of
diffuse attenuated slow delta activity and periods of discontinuity.  Periods of sleep are fragmented
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous video ~19-hour EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. These
findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Overall quantity of sleep captured during the recording epoch is small - lack of sleep may
contribute to worsening mental status.
