CLINICAL HISTORY: A 33-year.old male with past history of traumatic brain injury in 2006, followed by headaches, ataxia, behavioral problems. depression but  no history of epilepsy
MEDICATIONS: Abilify, Depakote, trazodone.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an
exceedingly drowsy patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there are some sections with a 10Hz alpha rhythm but other times when the EEG demonstrates a much slower alpha rhythm with slower, higher amplitude, 6 Hz theta. The patient appears to be very drowsy, dropping into micro sleeps with vertex waves and then arousal. The patient appeared to be falling asleep In hyperventilation.
Head rocking artifacts were noted.
Photic stimulation did not clearly activate the record.
IMPRESSION: his Is a likely abnormal EEG due to excess 6 Hz theta noted In the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were noted. This EEG was remarkable for significant head rocking artifact. Given the appearance of vertex activity, the central 6 Hz theta activity may represent a drowsy pattern. If appropriate, evaluation of an underlying sleep deficit
