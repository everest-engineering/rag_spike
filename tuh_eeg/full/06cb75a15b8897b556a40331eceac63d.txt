CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post cardiac arrest on October 5 with initially a burst suppression EEG, now off versed.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, antibiotics, Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.  No involuntary eye twitching was noted, but sometimes the patient was observed to have stiffening of the jaw.  Corneal and pupillary reflexes were absent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Although there are some sections of the record somewhat obscured by muscle, the overall 24-hour recording includes a now frontally predominant, more generalized periodic complex.  The periodic complexes transition from a CZ complex to more of a frontal complex.  There is occasional asymmetry, but it is generally frontally predominant.
Vecuronium was provided to eliminate muscle and to confirm the cerebral nature of the complex.
Over this 24-hour section the EEG activity is increasingly blunted with a more of a periodic sharp than a spike, lower voltage activity, and slowing of the periodic complex with sometimes as few as 2 in a 10-second period and at the very end of the recording 1 in a 10-second period.
Heart rate:  80 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This multi-day long term video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
A generalized periodic complex with an initial somewhat PLEDs pattern.
Slowing of the periodic activity.
Progressive background suppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe, anoxic insult.  The overall pattern is a pattern of thick lining cortical function.
