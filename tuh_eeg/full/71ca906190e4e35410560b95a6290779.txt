History:	29 year old male with a history of seizures. Last seizure in 2013.  This is a follow up
Medications:	Tegretol, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The AP gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-
7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to mild background slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
