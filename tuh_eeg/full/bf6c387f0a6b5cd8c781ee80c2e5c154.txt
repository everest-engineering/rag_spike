CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old male with meningitis, epilepsy, dementia, and schizophrenia, now with impaired balance and behavioral changes.
MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, Lamotrigine, Lamictal, Klonopin, Clozapine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Occasional shifting slowing is noted, particularly in drowsiness. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In an adult of this age group, these are nonspecific findings and may reflect age related changes in dementia, the effects of the previous childhood meningitis or neuropsychiatric medications.
