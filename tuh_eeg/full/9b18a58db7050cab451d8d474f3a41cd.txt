History:	54 year old male with history of subdural hematoma and now status epilepticus.
Medications:	Dilantin, Keppra, Phenobarbital, Midazolam, Coumadin, Lovenox, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the central
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of beta activity,
with increase amplitude and faster frequencies on the left consistent with a breach.  Periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the left region at a rate of 1 Hz. They
have a complex field that begins with maximum negativity in the occipital region and then moves
centrally.  Clinically with each discharge there is an associated right shoulder jerk.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, continuous, left central, Focal motor
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, left central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, with an associated breach
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous focal motor seizures arising from the left central
region. In addition there is evidence of irritability and structural dysfunction in the same region,
which is consistent with the known previous SDH. Lastly there is diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
