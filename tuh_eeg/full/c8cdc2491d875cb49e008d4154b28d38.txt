CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed male with a stroke 6 months ago and right-sided weakness. Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Ability, Celexa, Amlodipine, Simvastatin, Mirtazapine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age with a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is, however, some shifting theta identified from either hemisphere. As the patient becomes drowsy this is somewhat more prominent from the left. Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements followed by vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at intermediate and faster flash frequencies.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild shifting theta from either side.
2. A subtle asymmetry with subtle focal slowing identified on the left and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. These findings may be part of this patient's underlying cerebrovascular disease. Correlation with history and imaging may be helpful.
