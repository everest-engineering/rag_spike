History:	57 YO MALE PRESENTS WITH PRIOR EEG,  ADMIT ON 3/30/15 WITH H/O NEW
RT SIDED WEAKNESS AND NOT ABLE TO SPEAK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES.
PMHX SIG FOR LT ACA/MCA 2014 STROKE, LT ICA COMPLETE OCCLUSION
WITH RESIDUAL RT SIDED WEAKNESS
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.Slightly attenuated over the left hemisphere.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-
75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in
the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
