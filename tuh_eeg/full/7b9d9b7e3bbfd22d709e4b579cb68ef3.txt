CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old male with epilepsy since 1984.  Seizures characterized by an aura of right finger locking and generalized tonic-clonic activity.  May occur in clusters and be associated with injury.  Past history of multiple head injuries, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, phenytoin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed but photic stimulation was deferred.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG primarily in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 3rd normal EEG for this adult.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. Please contact the lab if copies of prior EEGS are needed
