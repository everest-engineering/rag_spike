CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old right handed male who had a speech arrest and confusion while playing cards with his wife on 3/24/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Atenolol, ASA, Amlodipine, Allopurinol, Lasix, Lovastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is slightly slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm of 8 Hz to 8.3 Hz. Central mu rhythm is identified at 7 Hz but testing is not performed to confirm this. Wicket is noted as the patient becomes drowsy. There are some minor shifting asymmetries. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG age due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
