History:	88 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SYNCOPE AND COLLAPSE, PT UNABLE TO RECALL DATE OF LAST EVENT. NO INFORMATION SENT REGARDING PT SYNCOPE HX FROM HOME/ AIDE UNABLE TO GIVE INFO AS
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, photic
Description: Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions (left more than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, mild diffuse, Excessive theta in wakefulness.
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal (left more than right) regions .  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
