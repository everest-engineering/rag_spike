HISTORY: 84 year old woman who had an episode of right leg pain, found
down. Patient has poor recollection of the event.
MEDICATIONS: Cardizem, Diovan, Metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively
low voltage. The patient is quite drowsy with a small amount of shifting theta in the right
or left temporal region. Features of stage I sleep include vertex waves. As the
recording continues, the patient has additional sections of the record where she is
relatively awake and cooperative with an overall improved organization of the
background and an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does not activate the
record.
132 bpm with occasional PVC's.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional shifting slowing, more so on the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background EEG is mildly abnormal for age. There
are no epileptiform features. Additional evaluation for the tachycardia is appropriate.
