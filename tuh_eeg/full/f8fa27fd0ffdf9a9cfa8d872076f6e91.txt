History: 75 year old woman with a history of right frontal stroke and subsequent seizures, is now admitted to the EMU for change mental, concerning of subclinical seizures.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low-to-moderate voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture is present.
Paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the left hemisphere. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake only 20-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and focal left hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically non-specific diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Continuous focal left hemispheric slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
