History:	22 YEAR OLD FEMALE PRESENTING WITH SEIZURES SINCE CHILDHOOD.
LAST SZ WAS 2 WEEKS AGO WHEN PT STOPPED MEDICATION AND HAD
WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A GEN. SZ. PT HAS HAD NO MEDS IN 2 WEEKS. POSITIVE
FAMILY HX. 4 OUT OF 7 SIBLINGS, INCLUDING HER TWIN SISTER, HAVE SZ.
Medications:	Dilantin(Stopped) Divalproex
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR is 70.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
