of slip and fall to the floor and episode of narcotic overdose.
MEDICATIONS: Percocet
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. If the
patient becomes drowsy there is a prominent in theta. Hyperventilation produces
bilateral slowing. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
