History:	32 YO MALE WITH INCREASED RANDOM PERIODS OF DIZZINESS, HEAD PAIN,
FACE PRESSURE. NO SZ REPORTED, NO MEDS
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral mid temporal region (left more
than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces enhanced
focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in those regions, which
is non-specific with regards to etiology.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
