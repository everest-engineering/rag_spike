History:	44 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. RIGHT SHOULDER PRESSURE WITH RIGHT
HAND NUMBNESS. OCCURS ASSOCIATED WITH DIZZINESS AND THEN LOC IN
2013. CHRONIC RIGHT-SIDED HEADACHES.
Medications:	Gabapentin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves. Patient easily went to Stage 2 sleep.  During stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
complexes appear.  REM sleep was seen in the last 4 seconds of recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR-66 bpm
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.  Sleep architecture abnormalities may represent a sleep disturbance. If clinically
indicated, may require sleep physiology studies.
