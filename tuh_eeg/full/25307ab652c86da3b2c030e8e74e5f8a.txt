CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 75-year-old male with history of gastric carcinoma, HHNK, lactic acidosis, admitted with repetitive facial twitching and obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ER using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had clinical seizures during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a low voltage, slow featureless pattern.  The activity is somewhat slower and lower voltage in the left hemisphere in comparison to the right.  The right hemisphere has more theta.
Three 30 seconds seizures were identified.  The first 2 are electrographically identical with rhythmic frontal delta.  Superimposed upon this, there is muscle and movement artifact.  Characteristics of both of the seizures include oral automatisms and a change in the patient's respiratory pattern with turning to the left.  The 3rd seizure at 3:15 a.m. is slightly different, beginning with 7 hertz theta, somewhat  more prominent R frontal.  It also has oral automatisms, the patient takes a deep breath, and has had turning to the left with facial grimacing.  Following the seizures, the EEG returns to the otherwise slow background.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Electrographic status epilepticus with multiple seizures in 20-minute period in the patient who is not awake or alert.
Frontal lobe localization of the seizures with two ictal patterns but clinical features to suggest R frontal focus.
Background slowing.
Left focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient will transition to long-term video EEG monitoring for additional management of electrographic seizures.
