Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 35 hours from 12/17/2015 to 12/19/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the attending neurologist for detection of seizures and changes in

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is intermittent diffuse attenuation seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
