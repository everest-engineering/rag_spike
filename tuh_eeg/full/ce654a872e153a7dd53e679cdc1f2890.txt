History: 87 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH RESPIRATORY FAILURE PRESENTS WITH EPISODE OF CONFUSION LASTING 1-2 MINUTES.
Medications: PREDNISONE, ASA. KOUR (?)
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 1 B·25Hz beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. There is excess diffuse theta activity during wakefulness.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1·21 Rashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR Is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excess theta during wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG due to excess theta activity during wakefulness. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. II clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
