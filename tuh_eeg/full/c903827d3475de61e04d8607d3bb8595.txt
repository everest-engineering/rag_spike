CLINICAL HISTORY:  Occipital infarct, persistent obtundation following seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was obtunded but with stimulation demonstrated brief arousals.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow, low voltage and relatively featureless.  It is primarily a pattern of theta with intermittent attenuations and delta.  Subtle, occipital sharp waves are noted.  These are relatively low voltage and at times somewhat periodic.  These are occasionally a bit more prominent on the left but really isoelectric between O1 and O2.  Stimulation of the patient produces some stiffening.  Additional drowsiness is remarkable for more attenuated pattern.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
More subtle, slow periodic sharp waves noted in the occipital regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is compatible with a severe underlying encephalopathy.  A bi-hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function of many different
causes could contribute to this.  No seizures were recorded.  In comparison to a previous study, the epileptiform activity today was not so prominent.
