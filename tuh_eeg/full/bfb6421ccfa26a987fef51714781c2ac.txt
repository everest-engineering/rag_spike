CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed woman with migraine headache with left hemi body numbness, no known seizures or epilepsy risk factors.
MEDICATIONS:  Imitrex, Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a sleep deprived EEG in a very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts was identified.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal  EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified but a normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy or migraine headache.
