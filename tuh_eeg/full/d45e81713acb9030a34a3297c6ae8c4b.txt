History:	52 YR OLD MALE R HANDED. PMHX.ETOH ABUSE SEIZURES.  PT SUFFERS
FROM DEPRESSION .
Medications:	Depakote, Lovenox
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  .  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing independently
in the bilateral midtemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
