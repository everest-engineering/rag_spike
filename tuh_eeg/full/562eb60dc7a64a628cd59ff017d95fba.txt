History:	28 Y/O MALE WITH SEVERE CHRONIC STATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY AND
OCCASIONAL SEIZURES LASTING 1 TO 2 MINUTES WITH STIFFENING
,NONVERBAL, WHEELCHAIR BOUND.
Medications:	VALPROIC ACID,KEPPRA,PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional brief bursts (up to 3 seconds) of generalized frontally
central maximal spike-and-wave and polyspike-and -wave discharges discharges occur with a
regular repetition rate of 2.5 Hz.  Some of this discharges have a large field with a prefrontal
predominance and at times slightly more temporal and asymmetric.  No clinical or electrographic
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, slow, frequent frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Disorganization, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  abundant frontocentral predominant burst of slow
generalized epileptiform discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Moderate diffuse
background slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy or
