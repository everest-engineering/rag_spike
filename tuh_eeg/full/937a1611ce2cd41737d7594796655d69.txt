History:	58 year old man with a history of seizures since childhood
Medications:	Coreg, Percocet, Ultram, Lasix, Mevacor, Proscar, Zestril, Restoril Lopid, Flonase,
Keppra, ,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Intermittent brief bursts of 10Hz activity
with an arch-shaped morphology occur independently over the central regions with shifting
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excess beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect.
