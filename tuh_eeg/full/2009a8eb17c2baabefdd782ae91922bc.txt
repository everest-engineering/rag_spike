History:	47 YR OLD FEMALE WITH H/O S/P LT MCA RUPTURED ANEURYSM 1/14, VASO ANGIOGRAM W/CONTRAST.





Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:


EEG DURING CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM FOR CHEMICAL TREATMENT OF VASOSPASM.
VERAPAMIL, PROPOFOL DRIP, LOVENOX, HEPARIN
None
Extended, >60 min, portable
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes




Description:
The background consists of a diffuse delta pattern with intermixed/overriding diffuse alpha activity. The faster frequencies are attenuated over the left hemisphere but can be seen best over the frontal regions. At times with increased sedation the background would become discontinuous with diffuse attenuation of faster frequencies for seconds. No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.

Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Study was 1hour and 5 minutes. Vasodilator was injected at 1:38:53PM, 1:42PM and 1:55PM. No clear changes to the background were noted. HR was 72

Summary of Findings:
Other, No changes noted.

Interpretation:
Uneventful EEG during cerebral angiogram.
