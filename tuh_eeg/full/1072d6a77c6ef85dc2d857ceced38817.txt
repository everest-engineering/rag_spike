CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old male with chronic static encephalopathy as well as depression, dementia, behavioral problems, aggression, extrapyramidal symptoms, and chronic static encephalopathy.  The patient to be evaluated for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Metronidazole, Phenytek 200 mg twice daily, Ativan p.r.n., folic acid.
INTRODUCTION:  The 31-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative, was agitated in the initial portions of the record, but eventually fell asleep.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the movement and the patient's behavior, the overall waking background is low voltage, diffusely slow with at best in a 7.8 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by the transition to a lower voltage more featureless pattern with a questionable asymmetry, somewhat lower amplitude on the right.
In apparent sleep, there seems to be 1 left hemispheric spike maximum at T5 and then later the patient was awake and moving about.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to;
Replacement of normal background with a somewhat low voltage slow pattern.
Questionable left hemispheric sharp spike wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features described above should be interpreted with caution due to the technical challenges described above.  Overall, this EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Given the patient's behavior, it may not be possible to repeat an EEG in search of epileptiform activity.
