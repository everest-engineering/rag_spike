REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 78-year-old woman with dementia, atrial fibrillation and GERD who presents with 3 days of right upper extremity shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software along with the patient's events and notes were used to review the EEG.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall there is some intermittent spindle frequency bursts seen intermittently and some intermittent arterial vascular movements seen throughout the recording.  The patient was stimulated with suctioning.  There appears to be no variability or increased frequency in the EEG.
Heart rate:  72.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slow waves and decreased amplitude at 2-4 Hz seen throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing and diffuse oppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, however, the intermittent spindles suggest that it is at least in part due to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
