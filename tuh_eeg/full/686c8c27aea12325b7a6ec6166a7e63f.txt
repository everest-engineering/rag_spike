History:	43 year old woman with an extensive PMH, including AIDS, now presents with
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, lethargic, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal there is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of
diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity, with delta activity most predominant anteriorly.  Subtle
symmetrical sleep spindles are captured early in the recording.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral frontal
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing
and focal bifrontal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal slowing in the bifrontal regions is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  A
single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 130 bpm.
