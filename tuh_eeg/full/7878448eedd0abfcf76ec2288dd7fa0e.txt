CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman admitted on the 11th with dizziness, blurry vision, and left-sided weakness, which resolved.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, aspirin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous, bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
