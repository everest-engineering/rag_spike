CLINICAL HISTORY: 35year old right handed woman with epilepsy until age 15, now 3 tonic /clonic seizures this past month. Family history of epilepsy .She previously had 1 to 2 seizures per year.
MEDICATIONS: Lamotrigine, Tegretol, Klonopin, Albuterol
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of  electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG Is well organized with  a 10.5Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. At the end of  hyperventilation, there is a high amplitude frontally predominant paroxysmal burst. There  appears to be an underlying spike or fast component prior to 4 bursts of 3to 4 Hz activity. A  second burst is noted at the close of t he hyperventilation, and this burst is a bit more posteriorly  predominant with a discrete either spike or fast activity prior to again 3 Hz discharges. The  background Immediately returns to a relatively awake pattern. Following this, another  paroxysmal burst without as clearly defined spike activity is noted, but there is some faster  frequency activity, similar to paroxysmal fast activity, noted prior to this with some both 13 and 19Hz activity. Features of drowsiness include stow-rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 3 to_4 Hz paroxysmal higher amplitude delta with suspicious underlying spike activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The activity was sometimes frontal but sometimes occipital. It is  not classic spike and wave activity but is likely an adult form of the generalized spike and wave  activity. If additional information is needed, a followup study can be considered.
