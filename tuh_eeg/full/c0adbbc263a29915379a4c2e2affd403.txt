CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old left handed male with orbital fungal infection , a nursing home resident, now with focal seizures; diabetes, hypertension, pacemaker.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Metoprolol, Phenytoin, Midazolam, Dopamine, Propofol.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and briefly hypotensive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is very abnormal. Initially, although the activity is discontinuous, there are bursts of sharp waves with bilateral representation but primarily sharp waves maximum in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread including central temporal and posterior temporal maximum. Midazolam is utilized initially but does not eliminate the bursts although sustained seizures are not identified. The patient presents in a comatose fashion and remains comatose throughout. At 2 a.m. as the midazolam is increased, the patient becomes hypotensive.
Propofol is initiated at 3:30. With the propofol the background becomes more suppressed. There are some sections with prolonged depression lasting more than 35 seconds. Bursts of activity at this point consist primarily of sharp waves from the right hemisphere. The sharp waves typically occur and, again, were maximum in the right hemisphere with some bilateral representation. The nurses note that tactile stimulation of the patient seems to produce an increase in the epileptiform activity. The patient requires dopamine to continue the seizure medication.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A very late but likely ictal status epilepticus pattern.
2. A focus from the right hemisphere.
3. A burst depression pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports highly irritating brain epileptiform activity and mainly from the right hemisphere with bilateral representation. The
