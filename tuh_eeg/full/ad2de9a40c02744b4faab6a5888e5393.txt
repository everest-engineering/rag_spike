CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old left handed woman with lupus, endometriosis, cerebral palsy, chest pain, and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, Zoloft, Oxycontin, Morphine, Klonopin, Prednisone, Singulair.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation is completed.  The patient experiences two of her typical seizures during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient's seizure is identified and is characterized in the EEG at 11:26.  The patient has eye flutter and trembling of the left hand.  She is somewhat interactive with the tech but does not answer questions until the event is over.  The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout the event.  When the event ends, the patient becomes a little bit drowsy with attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
During photic stimulation, the patient starts shaking her head.  There are no epileptiform features, just a normal driving response.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The behaviors described above did not have an EEG signature.  They are relatively characteristic of nonepileptic seizures.  If additional information is needed, EEG monitoring may be considered.
