CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 34-year-old woman with previous stroke, previously evaluated for seizure on December 1, 2012.  No recent report of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Wellbutrin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes of 100 microvolt.  Posterior slow waves of youth were identified.  As the patient became drowsy, there was dropout of the alpha rhythm in the left occipital region prior to that on the right and the subtle focal slowing in the left mid to posterior temporal region.  There was sharply contoured alpha frequency in the left parieto-occipital regions, but no definitive sharp waves.
Photic stimulation elicited supra-harmonic driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Dropout of the alpha rhythm on the left prior to the right.
Intermittent, subtle focal slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 3rd EEG for this patient.  This EEG did not demonstrate sharp waves on the right.  The subtle focal slowing, with dropout of the alpha rhythm on the left earlier in drowsiness and intermittent focal slowing on the left is congruent with the history of left PCA infarct.  No sharp waves were noted in this EEG.
