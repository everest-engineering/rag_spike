History:	55 year old woman with a history of DM and HIV, presents with weakness and
Medications:	Metformin, lisinopril, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal 10 Hz alpha activity is noted.  The AP gradient is unstable.  Frequent 50-
75uV, 4-7Hz waves are interspersed throughout the recording.  During drowsiness, the amount of
theta activity increases.
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is noted over the left anterior region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left anterior
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
occasional moderate left anterior slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Occasional left anterior focal slowing is suggestive
of focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges are present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
