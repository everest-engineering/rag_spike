CLINICAL HISTORY:   42 year old right handed woman with a past medical history of hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and alcohol abuse.  She was admitted to the hospital due to falling at work.  The fall was followed by convulsions with eyes rolling back and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Librium, Norvasc, Lorazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 8-1/2 to 9 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies and lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During brief drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and is replaced by diffuse theta and beta activities at lower amplitudes.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no change in the background.  Photic stimulation results in symmetric bilateral occipital driving.
Epileptiform discharges:  None.
Persistent tachycardia is noted on single the EKG lead with heart rate up to 120 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges
Tachycardia.
IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This is a normal awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were noted; however, stage II sleep was not achieved.  If clinical suspicion for seizures remains, repeat EEG with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
The lack of epileptiform discharges noted on EEG does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Sinus tachycardia was noted on the single EKG lead.
