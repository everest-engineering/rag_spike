tonic-clonic seizure but was reportedly confused afterwards.No incontinence no tongue biting.

No current facility-administered medications for this visit. SEDATION: none
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND: .
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta
activity, organized in a normal Wakefulness is characterized by Hertz posterior dominant rhythm symmetrically with eye opening. acceptable for an adult of this
anterior-to-posterior gradient. a symmetric and reactive 10.5 (PDR), which attenuates
The overall organization is age
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	Hypersynchronous rhythmic, paroxysmal slowing was noted
Sleep: Scant stage II sleep was noted.	There were abundant POSTS No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with acceptable cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: The patient	was falling asleep during photic stimulation
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION: -
This is routine EEG is within normal limits . There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
This is the fourth normal EEG for this subject
