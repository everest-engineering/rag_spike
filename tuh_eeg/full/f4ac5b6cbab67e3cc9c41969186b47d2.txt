History:	74 Y/O FEMALE R HANDED. ADMITTED TO TEMPLE FOR SYNCOPE VS SZ. ED BELIEVES IT IS SECONDARY TO HYPOGLYCEMIA. 55 CM HEAD NO H/O SZ.
Medications:	SIMVASTATIN,METFORMIN,ALENDRONATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 66
Technical difficulties: Very frequent eye movement artifact throughout the record.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific
