CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 39-year-old male with first ever seizure 3 weeks ago, not otherwise described.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a relatively low-voltage EEG with 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of wakefulness and sleep with prominent TOSTS and then vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Hyperventilation produced some increase in the amplitude of the background.
Heart rate 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Electroencephalogram within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a somewhat technically challenging, but normal EEG.
No epileptiform features were identified.  Sweat or other artifact may have contributed to the technical issues identified in this record.
