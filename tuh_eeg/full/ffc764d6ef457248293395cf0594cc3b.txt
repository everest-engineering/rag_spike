INTRODUCTION:
Routine EEG was performed using the standard 10 to 20 electrode placement system at anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes. The patient was recorded awake and stage I sleep. Photic stimulation was performed. No hyperventilation was performed.
MEDICATIONS:
No medications listed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None
HISTORY:
A 80-year-old female with history of ischemic stroke without thrombolysis, left arm tingling and numbness, and past medical history of end-stage renal disease, on dialysis, CAD, diabetes, hypertension, COPD, CHF, and cardiomyopathy.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
EEG opens up to posterior dominant rhythm of 9Hz with amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts, which is reactive to eye opening and eye closing. Stage I seen and photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges. No hyperventilation was done.
Normal frontal central beta activity is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE:
There is independent bilateral F7-T1 and F8-T2 focal flowing seen occasionally
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal awake and sleepy due to independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG is consistent with independent bilateral anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with
regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
