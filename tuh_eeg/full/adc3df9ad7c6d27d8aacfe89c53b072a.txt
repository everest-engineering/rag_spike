3/15- OSH WITH RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS/NUMBNESS/ANEMIA

POST OP EXPRESSIVE APHASIA
Medications:	LABETOLOL, ZOFRAN, MANNITOL, MORPHINE, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eye
opening but can only be seen over the right hemisphere..  Right hemisphere 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over the frontal region.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is an associated loss of
faster frequencies over this region.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right
anterior temoporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mid, loss of faster frequencies
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing and loss of
faster frequencies in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region involving both gray and white matter. In addition there is  intermittent focal
slowing in the right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
