LENGTH OF RECORDING:  29 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of stroke 4 weeks ago.  Since that time she presented with right facial droop, right-sided weakness, and left foot weakness due to hypertensive emergency.  Her symptoms resolved.  She had a similar episode several months ago.  Additionally, she also had twitching on the right side.  She still occasionally has this.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates versus theta and symmetrical vertex waves are captured.  Nearly continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left anterior temporal region.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and accentuates left temporal slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical driving and multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate nearly continuous left anterior temporal slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
No __________.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 29-minute EEG due to mild left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, microstructural etiology.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, patient's sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with the patient asleep may be of benefit.
