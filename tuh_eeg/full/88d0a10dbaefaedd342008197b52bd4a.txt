History:	56 YR MALE WITH  LARGE PONTINE BLEED.  S/P VENTRIC.  EEG FOR
REACTIVITY
Medications:	MEDS ER. MIDAZOLAM, LABETALOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
In restfulness, the background is diffusely slow in the theta and delta frequencies and attenuated.
However with stimulation, an 8Hz alpha rhythm can be seen over the left hemisphere and a more
organized pattern emerges.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Pseudoposts were seen in
the right occipital region
Nearly continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in right occipital-temporal area.
Occasional right occipital sharp waves were seen, maximally at O2  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was notable reactivity to
painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, right occipital
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  nearly continuous focal slowing and occasional
epileptiform discharges in the right temporal-occipital area.  These findings are indicative of a
potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right temporal-occipital region.
