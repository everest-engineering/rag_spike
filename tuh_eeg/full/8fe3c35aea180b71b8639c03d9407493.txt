REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm with a reach of 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some decrease of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation proved no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously at F7/T3 and at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
FEATURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  54.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous left anterior temporal and midtemporal focal slowing in addition to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal and midtemporal regions which may be related to the known hemorrhage and/or shunt placement. In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
