CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 42-year-old woman with an episode of standing, staring and inability to speak for 1 minute.  After that she collapsed.  History of migraines, asthma, Meniere disease, and depression
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol #3, Symbicort, Klonopin, Ambien, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is and technically an acceptable record aside from T1-T2 electrode impedances which are greater than 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG in wakefulness includes a pattern with generous beta and an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta.  Vertex waves were not identified, but spindles were noted in sleep.
Photic stimulation: elicits vigorous driving with driving and supra-harmonic driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta described above may be due to this patient's medications or anxiety, no epileptiform features were noted.
