CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old male with schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, admitted with 2 seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  10 mg Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent throughout.  This was a somewhat technically challenging record due to background muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage, and relatively featureless with slow, low-voltage delta.  In this low-voltage pattern, there is a suggestion of a little bit more slow delta in the right posterior quadrant but there is also some head-rocking artifact.  Low amplitude, rare, discrete sharp waves were noted in the right mid temporal region with on rare occasions an after going slow wave.
Tactile stimulation of the patient produced moaning and stiffening.
Heart rate 67 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, slow pattern.
A suspicious, rare, low voltage, right temporal sharp waves in the context of a low voltage background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of the significant, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or pharmacologic effect.
The subtle temporal sharp waves raise the possibility of a localization-related mechanism for seizures.
