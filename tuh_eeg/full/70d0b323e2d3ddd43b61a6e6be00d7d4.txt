CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed male with right carotid stenosis.


MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Propofol, isoflurane, Phenylephrine, Versed.


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a four-hour study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins the patient is aware with a normal awake pattern.  Induction of anesthesia produces a discontinuous pattern. The recording becomes continuous.  The carotid is clamped at 3:15 p.m.  Internal carotid clamped.  No focal features are noted at that time. Patency is confirmed by Doppler at 4:56.  At that time the patient's level of anesthesia is significantly lighter. Recording concludes at 5:00 p.m.

HR:	60 bpm


IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this carotid endarterectomy study did not identify significant focal features.
