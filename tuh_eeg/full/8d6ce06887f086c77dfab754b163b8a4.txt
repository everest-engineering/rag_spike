CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed woman with a history or some sort of prenatal MRI abnormality and previous evaluations for various types of seizures. Previously evaluated in 2008.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, Lovenox, Topamax
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The clinical team reports no events. The patient does have an episode of crying. In addition, at the end of this section of the record, she has an episode after a phone call with repetitive right arm movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Abundant stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts. The jiggly movements of the right arm were associated with EKG artifact in the right posterior scalp electrodes compatible with head rocking.
There is no push button. Testing was not performed during this event, but the remainder of the EEG demonstrates a completely normal awake pattern with just artifact.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION/CORRELATION:  This EEG monitoring is remarkable for a normal awake and sleep pattern with an episode of right arm jiggling with EKG artifact, consentient with nonepileptic event.
