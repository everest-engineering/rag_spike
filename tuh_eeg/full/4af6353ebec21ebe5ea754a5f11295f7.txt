AGE: 65 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 12/30/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1884
HISTORY :
65 y.o. female with a history of multiple prior aneurysms.	Not clear if the patient has had aneurysm surgery,	referred for routine EEG for syncope, possible TIA or seizure .
MEDICATIONS :
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit .
SEDATION : None TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system . This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
It was a prominent increase in beta but sleep was not sustained Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Deferred
Photic Stimulation: Elicits driving only at faster flash frequencies
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
