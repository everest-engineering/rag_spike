CLINICAL HISTORY:    53 year old right handed male with a seizure 1 month ago after finishing dialysis. Past seizure just 10 years ago. Renal failure, hypertension, hemodialysis.

MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, Simvastatin, Metoprolol, Propoxyphene, Omeprazole, ASA, Renal
Caps, Hydroxyzine, Clotrimazole

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is 7.8 Hz, 40 microvolts. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity is observed. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta activity. There is a suggestion of a beta accentuation in the left frontocentral region and a single left frontal sharp wave is noted in drowsiness. Two left frontal sharp waves are noted in drowsiness. Photic stimulation is performed eliciting an alerting response and on one occasion around the time of photic stimulation, the alpha starts to achieve 9 Hz.

HR: 	96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background  slowing and disorganization.
2. 	Rare left frontal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORR ELATION: The background slowing and disorganization may be interpreted in the clinical context of an individual with multiple medical problems. Considerations for underlying ischemia white matter pathology are appropriate. In addition, the left frontal sharp waves suggest a localization for epilepsy.
