CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old right handed male, admitted on February 19, 2012 with lightheadedness, seizure one month ago, recently started on Dilantin.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG includes an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small asymmetry in muscle artifact and there may be some asymmetries with electrode placement given slightly irregular eye movement artifact.  Despite this, there is occasional left, more than right, temporal focal, isolated delta.  Prominent wicket is noted. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving.
HR:   72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle, independent, left to right temporal delta and theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG for this individual without epileptiform activity.  The temporal focal slowing is a nonspecific finding, common in
older adults with cerebrovascular disease.  If this individual is thought to have had multiple seizures, please consider a 1-hour outpatient EEG.
