History:	50 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS TO ED WITH TC SZ'S IN THE AM.
PMHX: HTN, EPILEPSY, DEPRESSION
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which is only seen  over the
left hemisphere  There is 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,  over the left frontocentral region.  No
Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal sharp waves
are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F8/T4.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, maximal in the anterior temporal
Sharp waves, frequent, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the right anterior
temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region,
there is  continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal  region.
This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  No clinical or electrographic
