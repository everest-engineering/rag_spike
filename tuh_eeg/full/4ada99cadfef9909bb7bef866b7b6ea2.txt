History:	43 year old with possible seizure disorder.
Medications:	Levetiracetam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves.
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At time this is sharply contoured and slightly
monomorphic.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and enhanced the
bitemporal slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any effect.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited awake, drowsy and asleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing
in the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in the
midtemporal region, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
