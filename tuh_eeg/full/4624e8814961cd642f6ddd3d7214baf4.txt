History:	25 year old man with a history of body GSW, who underwent cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.  Patient had an episode yesterday concerning for seizure.
Medications:	Fentanyl, Keppra, Ancef, Insulin, Bumetanide, Octreotide, Kepzol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of attenuated diffuse polymorphic
slow delta activity.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  They
appear to increase with stimulation but also are at times very rhythmic occurring every 2 seconds.
No normal sleep architecture is present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Continuous EKG artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, severe
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a very ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG due to severe diffuse slowing and attenuation. These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Triphasic-
like waves could either represent true triphasic waves or ventilator artifact.  Triphasic waveforms are
seen in various forms of encephalopathy.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG
does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
