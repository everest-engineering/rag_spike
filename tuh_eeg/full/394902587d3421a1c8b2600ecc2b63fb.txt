History:	48 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ONSET STARRING SPELLS 10/2013,
LASTING 30SEC TO 1 MIN. THEN BACK TO BASELINE ALONG WITH RECALL
OF EVENT. PT REPORTS EVENTS OCCUR 3-4 X A DAY.
Medications:	NEURONTIN 300MG  3 X A DAY
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present at T3 during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuated focal slowing
in the T3 region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce
additional abnormalities.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, mild, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
