HISTORY:	81 YEAR OLD MALE EVALUATED TO RULE OUT SEIZURES. PATIENT
PRESENTS WITH DAILY EPISODES OF LOC, GENERALIZED SHAKING, UPWARD
GAZE, INCONTINENCE SINCE 5/13/14. HISTORY OF STROKE TIMES 2 AND MI
TIMES 2 AND LEFT LEG ABOVE THE KNEE AMPUTATION.
Medications:	KEPPRA, NEURONTIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 72  There is a continuous pacemaker artifact seen throughout the
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, which is
consistent with the known stroke.
