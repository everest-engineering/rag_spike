CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed female with history of refractory right temporal lobe epilepsy with multiple seizures per day.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized.  There is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with 8 Hz mu activity.  Underlying subtle focal slowing is seen in the right temporal region with intermittent rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity.  Wicket is noted from the right or left temporal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by POSTS, and then brief spindles.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep, but does elicit a driving response.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing is ipsilateral to this patient's mesial temporal sclerosis.  Of note, prior EEGs have demonstrated right or left temporal focal features.
