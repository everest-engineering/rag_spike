CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old woman with complex neurological and neurosurgical history, refractory epilepsy, and many adverse medication reactions.  Status post prolonged seizure 1 day prior to EEG monitoring.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Benadryl, oxycodone, Ativan, gabapentin, Zoloft, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  No clinical events were reported.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with generous beta and abundant lambda.  Intermittently, the waking background demonstrates rhythmic background theta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep were more difficult to define but 1, potential EPOCH of REM sleep was noted.

Events: At 6pm there was a dreamlike state with no EEG correlate. There were also episodes of tremulousness around that time  without PB and with no EEG correlate.
Electrographic seizures:  None.
Epileptiform detections:  None.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This first 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Intermittent excess theta noted in the background.
Stage II sleep with beta spindles was noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The intermittent excess theta may be associated with the use of sedative hypnotic medications.  No epileptiform features were seen.
