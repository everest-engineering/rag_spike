History:	83 year old woman with a history of strokes, now presents with fluctuating mental
Medications:	SINEMET, METOPROLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~13 hours from 10/07/2014 till 10/08/2014.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.    Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring
technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry is present.
The background over the left consists of polymorphic poorly modulated 8-9 Hz activity posteriorly,
weak AP gradient and excess theta activity.  Continuous polymorphic delta >theta activity and
voltage attenuation are present over the right hemisphere.  Periods of quiescence are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, moderate-to-severe
Attenuation, moderate, right hemispheric
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~13 hours continuous video EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing
and focal moderate-to-severe right hemisphere slowing and attenuation. Diffuse is indicative of
mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal
slowing and attenuation indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  No electrographic
