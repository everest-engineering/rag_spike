CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed female with a history of seizures since 2008. A strong family history of seizures. The last seizure was November of 2009. The seizures are characterized by ringing in the ears, echoing of voice heard, scream, tonoclonic activity, and tongue biting. History of bipolar disease.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal, Zoloft, Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background included a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background with a rhythmic theta and vertex waves in stage I sleep. Spindles are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits driving. Photic stimulation elicits some asynchronous bursts in the temporal regions. These are a bit more marked on the left.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A asynchronous bursts in the hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific. This is the second EEG for this patient. Neither of these studies have identified epileptiform activity. Additional recording may be considered.
