LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old man who is going to undergo open heart surgery on 12/21/2012.  The patient has a history of chronic type B dissection, dilated aortic arch, atrial fibrillation, COPD, DVT, type 2 diabetes, and drug abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are Reglan, morphine, Zofran, and heparin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single electrocardiogram lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate up to 120 beats per minute and interbeat pauses up to 1 second.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.  A single electrocardiogram lead demonstrates an irregular heart beat at times up to 120 beats per minute, with interbeat pauses greater than 1 second.
