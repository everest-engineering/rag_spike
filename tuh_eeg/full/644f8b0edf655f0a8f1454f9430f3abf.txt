CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old man with cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and hepatic hemangioma who presents with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Oxcarbazepine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and an additional single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to the patient asleep; however, during wakefulness at best we can see a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which reacts to eye opening.  Although the majority of the recording was during sleep, stage I and stage II, there is also some frontocentral beta seen in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves at F7/T3, seen frequently.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 more than F8/T4 at 2 to 4 Hz and at 20 to 75 microvolts amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal forward sharp waves.
Bilateral left more than right anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localized related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of bitemporal (left more than right) focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
