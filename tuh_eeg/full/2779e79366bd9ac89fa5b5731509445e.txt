AGE: 54 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 12/17/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 151828
HISTORY:
54 y.o. female with a history of epilepsy referred for routine EEG for routine EEG.	Seizures poorly described but characterized by loss of consciousness and tongue biting
MEDICATIONS:
Phenobarbital
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, with HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Produces small increase in amplitude of the background
Photic Stimulation: Elicits scant driving response EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during
this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
