CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84-year-old woman with history of subdural hematoma since 2008, ill defined history of seizures with headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness the background is appropriately organized for age.  There is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm which is reactive to eye opening and a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Early in drowsiness there is slowing of the alpha rhythm and the appearance of some theta.
As the patient becomes drowsy there is some shifting slowing noted early in drowsiness.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within acceptable limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is a small amount of shifting slowing early in drowsiness.  There are no focal or epileptiform features.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered.
