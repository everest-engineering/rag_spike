History:	44 YR OLD  MALE WITH PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ WITH ALTERED MENTAL
STATUS AND HEADACHE/ HYPOGLYCEMIC
Medications:	MEDS PRIOR TO ADMIT : LAMICTAL, ZONISAMIDE.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  At
times there is frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is seen.  Some sharply countoured
frontal discharges seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing, FIRDA, and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
