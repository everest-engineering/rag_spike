History:	50 Y/O MALE.CHG, MENTAL IN STATUS .NO H/O SZ.
Medications:	ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an intermittent 25-40uV, 7.5 -8Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present
intermittently, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is
present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  Intermittent diffuse, frontally
maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These
waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  There is a high amplitude sharply
countoured occipital discharge that does not evolve or appear to be epileptogenic.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Patient was reported to have left
shoulder jerking with no clear EEG correlate.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of Intermittent frontally-maximal
triphasic waves and mild to moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of
a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic
