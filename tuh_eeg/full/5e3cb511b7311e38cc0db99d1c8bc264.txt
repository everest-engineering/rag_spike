CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed gentleman with a history of epilepsy
and heart transplant in 2002.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Vasotec, Zocor, Prograf, ASA, Imdur, Omeprazole, Tramadol
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG video was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not
attempted because of cardiac status, but photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient has well organized
7 Hz alpha and 7 Hz mu is seen during the recording. Amplitude is low. At
times there is some slowing. There was theta activity seen as well. During photic stimulation there was scant driving. Hyperventilation was not attempted.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was no focal epileptiform discharge seen; however,
this study lacked stage II sleep. A follow up, EEG should be done capturing stage II sleep for this patient because of excessive sleepiness. Excessive sleepiness could explain the findings.
