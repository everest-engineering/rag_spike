Technologist:
70 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS W/ GEN INCREASE IN TONE IN ARMS-LEGS ( FINE TREMORS) LASTING 20 MIN. LOADED WITH VERSED, ATIVAN AND KEPPRA IN ED. PMHX SIG FOR IDDM, HIV
None

Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes




Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present but state changes are noted.

Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Pseudoperiodic to periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present at F8/T4 at a rate of 1 Hz. At times the appear to have some rhythmicity with state changes but with no definite evolution.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 108 with PVC's This record is markedly limited by muscle artifact over both hemispheres.

Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), intermittent, right temporal, anterior Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous

Interpretation:
This is an limited ABNORMAL EEG because of periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges and nearly continuous focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region. These findings are indicative of a highly irritable structural lesion in this region with a high risk for generating seizures. In addition there is diffuse background slowing. This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.	;}
