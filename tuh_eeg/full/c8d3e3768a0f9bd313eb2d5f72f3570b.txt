CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old woman with a history of recurrent left insular astrocytoma, status post resection the day before the EEG was performed.  She had a 30-second episode of unresponsiveness and worsening of aphasia postoperatively.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, morphine, and metoprolol, and dexamethasone.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an addition of an EKG lead.  The patient was recorded during drowsiness. This is a bedside record and photic stimulation was not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a marked asymmetric EEG. There is asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with left hemisphere having glimpse of alpha rhythm and continues a rhythmic delta activity.  This is maximum in the left centrotemporal region.  There is a breach rhythm, but there are also some sharp waves in the left mid temporal region.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a mildly slow background with alpha rhythm in the range of 7.5 Hz.  Features of drowsiness include increasing delta on the left.  In wakefulness and drowsiness, there are bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the left centrotemporal region.
Heart rate is 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Continuous focal slowing on the left hemisphere.
Slowing on the right hemisphere.
Occasional single sharp waves, only on the left side.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left, compared with the patient's history and full of simple sharp waves on the left side, but no seizures.
