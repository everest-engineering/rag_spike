CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed male with a history of brain abscess surgery, dizziness, and seizures, who presented with seizure a couple of months ago and dizziness.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Zonisamide.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  There is a slight increase over the left frontal region as I will describe below.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I/stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen continuously at F3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  There is also an associated breach in this region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal slowing.
Breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region, which is consistent with the known abscess and surgery in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
