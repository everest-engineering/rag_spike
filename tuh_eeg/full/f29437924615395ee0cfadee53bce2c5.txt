CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old woman admitted with nephrotic syndrome, intermittent confusion and possible complex partial seizure. Acute nephrotic syndrome with encephalopathy and possible seizure on April 11, history of epilepsy
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG monitoring was  performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No clinical seizures were noted.  There were electrode artifacts noted.  The patient was awake and eating, but was at times confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow with a low voltage relatively featureless theta pattern.  The typical morphologies expected in wakefulness including an alpha rhythm were not identified.  Intermittent rhythmic, right temporal slowing was noted.  As the patient transitions into sleep, spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Other features of sleep include slow rolling eye movements and some poorly formed vertex waves.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring for this young adult was remarkable for:
A diffusely slow low voltage background.
Intermittent, rhythmic right temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG differs considerably from a previous 2003 EEG which was normal.  The low voltage diffusely slow pattern may be related to this patient's metabolic encephalopathy.  The rhythmic right temporal slowing was not previously noted and be part of this patient's metabolic features, but may also be related to the patient's underlying epilepsy syndrome.
