CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed woman who had an aneurysm clipped
in 2000, seizure free for the last 2 years until she had a break through seizure in
November 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and
hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is relatively low voltage
with generous beta activity. Breech rhythm is noted with accentuation of 1 0-13 Hz in
the left temporal region. Frequent eye blink is noted. As the patient becomes drowsy
there is very subtle theta noted in the left anterior temporal region, as well as wicket.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at faster frequencies. Hyperventilation produces
an increase in amplitude of the background.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Paucity of the alpha rhythm.
2. Subtle left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the context of a breech rhythm, the focal slowing is
quite subtle. While previous EEGs demonstrated left anterior temporal sharp waves,
none were identified today.
