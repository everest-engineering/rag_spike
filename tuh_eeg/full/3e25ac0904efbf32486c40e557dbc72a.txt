CLINICAL HISTORY:  37 YR MALE WITH SZS, MR HIGH FUNCTIONING AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. Evaluate for Delirium, agitation.  Possible seizures
MEDICATIONS:  DILANTIN, VALIUM
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was restless and had difficulty cooperating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
Background:  The background EEG is diffusely slow, poorly organized, lacking typical morphologies of an awakened adult EEG.  It is a mixture of delta and theta with smaller amounts of beta.
During sleep, the pattern is more of a rhythmic slow theta pattern.  Sleep is not sustained and the patient is actually quite restless during sleep.
Seizures:  None.
Interictal epileptiform discharges:  None.
Heart rate 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Electroencephalogram monitoring for this adult schizophrenic with change in mental status of unknown cause is abnormal due to:
marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were noted and there were no epileptiform features.  This electroencephalogram is more supportive of a diffuse cerebral process, such as an encephalopathy rather than an underlying epileptogenic disorder.
