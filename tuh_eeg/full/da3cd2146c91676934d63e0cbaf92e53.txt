History:	58 year old man with a history of lymphoma, now presents with increase in seizure
frequency.
Medications:	KEPPRA, ATIVAN, DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
The posterior dominant at best consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 6-7 Hz activity  There
is no clear AP gradient.  Additional, polymorphic diffuse theta and delta activity is noted.  During
sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles are noted.
Two electrographic seizures are captured (at ~ 15:29 min and ~20:28 min into the recording).
First seizure last ~ 1:42 minutes.  Duration of the second seizure is not known since the recording
stops prior to seizure termination.  Seizures start with low amplitude sharply contoured fast activity
in Fp1 electrode that gradually increases in frequency and decreases in amplitude and evolves into
rhythmic 8-9 Hz sharp activity.  Seizure remains primarily within Fp1 electrode with some  minimal
spread vs reflection into Fp2 electrode.  Video review during the first seizure demonstrates a house
officer examining the patient. House officer does not comment on any clinical change during the
seizure.  Video review demonstrates a patient who looks around and at one point flexes and
his right upper extremity.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Seizure, two, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse background
slowing and 2 left focal fronto polar seizures. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There is epileptogenic focus in the left
fronto polar region.  This patient was placed on continuous long-term EEG monitoring and the
results were conveyed to the primary team.
