History:	35 year old man status post cardiac arrest and hypoglycemia.
Medications:	VERSED- being weaned off, Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~20 hours from 4/22/2015 till 4/23/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation, the background voltages increase and a mixture
of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with underriding low amplitude fast
activity appears.  Periods of quiescence are characterized by large amount of low-to-moderate
amplitude fast activity admixed with bursts of theta-delta activity.  There is persistent paucity of
faster frequencies over the right, but the asymmetry continues to lessen.
No clear electrographic seizures are present.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric, especially over the
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~20 hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
continuous focal right hemispheric slowing (especially over the temporal region) that lessens as the
recording progresses. There is focal cerebral dysfunction over the right, possibly post-ictal in
etiology since it continues to improve .  Diffuse slowing is a  nonspecific indicator of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
