CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old right handed male, first ever seizure, found at home, confused.  Recent history of head trauma and possible alcohol withdrawal.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra, Folic Acid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG shows that there is an alpha rhythm reaching 8.5 hertz, but there is a small amount of excess theta.  Drowsiness includes an increase in background slowing followed by vertex waves and spindles.  Sleep is disrupted.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The features described above are non-specific and can be seen in post ictal state or diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study in the lab is suggested.
