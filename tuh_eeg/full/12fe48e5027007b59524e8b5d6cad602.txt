CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old female with syncope versus seizures, MRI negative.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, reactive 11 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and if seizures are an important consideration, a followup study should be considered.
