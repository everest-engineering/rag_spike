History:	68 year old woman with many recurrent stereotyped episodes in the last 3 years that
have been called TIAs.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Voltages are diffusely very low.  Patient remains awake throughout the
No focal slowing is present.  Patient had an episode of stuttering/ some expressive difficulties.
Episode starts at ~ 11:13 AM and ends at ~ 11:14:30 am.  Symptoms fluctuate throughout the
episode with some improvement in the middle.  Patient is being asked questions by the EEG
technologist.  She suddenly develops stuttered-like speech, some slurring, some expressive
difficulties.  She is awake and follows commands.  When asked to recall what she was asked to
remember, she says, with visible difficulty, " I cannot get words out".  There is no change on the
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  An irregular heart rate was noted on a
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Cardiac arrhythmia
Event, one, slurred speech, stuttering, expressive difficulties
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. An event last ~90 seconds was captured (please see description
above). There was abnormal EEG correlate.  However, only ~ 25% of simple partial seizures are
captured on a scalp EEG.  Ordering physician was contacted at the time of the EEG read.
