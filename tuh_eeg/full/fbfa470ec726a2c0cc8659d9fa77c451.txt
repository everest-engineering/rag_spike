CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 81-year-old woman, status post AAA replacement 1 day postop, now with hallucinations, agitation, aggressive, and combative behavior in the ICU.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Haldol, morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive in the initial sections of the record, having received Haldol and then received Ativan during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial EEG demonstrates a high amplitude, diffusely slow, poorly organized record with primarily rhythmic theta.  The EEG demonstrates frontally predominant triphasic waves, some of which are asynchronous.  There are also isolated left hemispheric sharp and slow wave complexes and waveforms have the characteristic morphology of a triphasic wave that are posteriorly predominant with anterior spread.  In this high amplitude, chaotic record, there are no definitive sustained seizures.
Ativan was given and by 3:54 p.m., the EEG transitions more to a lower voltage theta pattern with clear improvement of the discharges noted when the study concludes at 3:57:14.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
High amplitude, markedly disorganized record.
Triphasic waves, posteriorly predominant.
Isolated or hemispheric spike and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Many of these features suggest a metabolic process.  The morphology of some of the waveforms, however, is focal or posteriorly predominant and therefore, this record cannot be considered to be exclusively a metabolic pattern. EEG monitoring will follow.
