W/RT HEMIPARESIS, HEAD TRAUMA  LT FRONTAL SKULL DEFECT/CRANI.  F/U
EEG PT STATES LAST SEIZURE. LAST NIGHT, HEAR AND SEE NO SPEECH,
DURATION 10 MIN.
Medications:	Trileptal, Dilantin, Abilify, Prozac, Pravachol, Ativan, Seroquel, Zoloft,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with
eye opening. There is hemispheric asymmetry characterized by higher amplitude on the left side.
Beta activity is well seen in the right frontal region.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Almost continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent focal sharp waves are present in the left
anterior temporal region, with no evolution.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Sharp waves, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Breach artifact, left
Interhemispheric asynchrony
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing and loss of
faster frequencies in the left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction involving cortex, which is possibly structural in origin.  Intermittent epileptiform
discharges in the left temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic
focus in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
