CLINICAL HISTORY:  74 year old right handed male with past medical history of hypertension and Parkinson's that had an episode of shaking different from usual Parkinson's where he slumped in the chair to the left and was staring, appeared sleepy and had visual hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Megestrol Acetate, Carbidopa-Levodopa, Ketoconazole.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep was recorded.  Photic stimulation are performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7.5 Hz at 20-50 mV amplitude.  There is some frontal central beta seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA).
SEIZURES  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slow waves.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
