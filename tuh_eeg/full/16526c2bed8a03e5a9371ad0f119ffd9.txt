CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 46-year-old woman admitted to the neurosurgical ICU with worst headache of her life, found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage.  Ventriculostomy.   Agitation and increased ICP.
MEDICINES:  Propofol, Versed, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine, bedside 20-minute EEG was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient's sedative hypnotics had been discontinued shortly before the EEG, but were re-initiated due to increasing ICP during the study. She has multiple burr holes
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow, and demonstrates intermittent attenuations of typically 1.5 seconds.  There is more of a pattern of attenuation and then suppression.  Intermittent muscle artifact was noted in the mid point in the record.
There is a suggestion of a breach rhythm in the left frontal central region with a slight accentuation of frequency in that region with some theta noted.  Later sections of the record demonstrate a bit more rhythmic paroxysmal theta.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intermittent attenuation of the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study supports a significant, bihemispheric process.  Contributing factors can be the use of anesthetic doses of sedative medications as well as this patient's acute neurosurgical condition of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
