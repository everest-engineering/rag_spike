CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old male with hypertension, renal failure on hemodialysis.  The patient had a motor vehicle accident while intoxicated and was admitted to the hospital on the third with a right subdural hematoma requiring right hemicraniectomy.  Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin (level 30), Percocet, Benadryl, Zofran, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was irritable.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulator were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern.  There is an asymmetry noted in this diffusely slow and poorly organized pattern. The left hemisphere includes primarily theta frequency activity with arrhythmic delta activity, but the right hemisphere includes higher amplitude arrhythmic delta activity which is at some points more continuous and at other points intermittent.  Occasional bursts of FIRDA were noted.  In addition there were bursts of shifting slowing.
Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening and eye closure.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral background slowing and disorganization.
Bursts of frontally predominant generalized somewhat irregular delta.
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere at times nearly continuous with more prominent arrhythmic delta activity on the right and disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  With stimulation, there is a clear alerting response noted and the presence of alpha frequency activity from each hemisphere.  These are positive prognostic features.  The background slowing and disorganization may be related to this patient's head trauma or metabolic issues and nearly continuous focal slowing on the right is congruent with a structural or functional process on that side.
