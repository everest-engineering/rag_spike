CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Midazolam, vecuronium, fentanyl, propofol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring is performed in the OR using standard carotid endarterectomy montage.  This is a technically acceptable record lasting 3.3 hours.  Physician supervision was available throughout the recording with physician, remote view for 90 minutes, including during the peak portions of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG begins at 7:50 a.m.  It begins with an anesthetic pattern which is continuous with mixed frequency beta, theta and delta.  There is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more slowing noted in the left hemisphere.
The carotid was clamped at 9:52 a.m.  No changes were noted with placement of clamps over the internal carotid and common carotid.  The common carotid was clamped at 9:58 a.m.  EEG results were reported back to the operative team.
The carotid was unclamped at 11:20 a.m.  Recording continued as patency was confirmed.  No EEG changes were associated with this.
EEG concluded at 11:36 a.m.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring during this left carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for no focal changes with placement of the clamp.
