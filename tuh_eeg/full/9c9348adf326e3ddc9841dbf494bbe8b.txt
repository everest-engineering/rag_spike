History:
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:

UNKNOWN FEMALE FOUND IN CATATONIC STATE. PT POSITIVE UDS amphetamine ,
benzos, opiates, barbs LOVENOX,  NALOXONE
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy , lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by a diffuse disorganized delta/theta discharges with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies and intermixed diffuse beta. No posterior dominant rhythm is present. The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen. The patient did not fall asleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mute diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication 		as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
