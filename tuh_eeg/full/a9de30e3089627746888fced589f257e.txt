History:	55 year old woman with a  history of seizures.
Medications:	Trileptal, Vimpat
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
No clear focal slowing is present.  A single high amplitude right anterior temporal (F8/T2 maximal)
sharp waves with aftergoing slow wave is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is various intermittent electrode
artifact during the first half of the recording- the technologists are fixing the leads and wrapping the
head for the procedure.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited, due to lead artifact
Sharp waves, one, right temporal, anterior
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because of intermittent electrode artifact in the first half of
the recording.  This limits interpretation of those portions of the EEG. EEG otherwise is abnormal
awake and drowsy due to a presence of a a single right anterior temporal epileptiform discharge.
This finding is indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in the right anterior temporal region.
