REASON FOR STUDY: Hypothermia protocol.
CLINICAL This Is a 73-year-old woman who presented for an AV fistula repair and h ad a PEA code for about an hour and found to have pulmonary embolus and now Is In hypothermic protocol.
MEDICATIONS: None mentioned.
A long-term EEG was performed from 11/1 /2013 to11/1612013 for a total of19 hours using the standard 10 20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded while unresponsive. Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike wave detection as wen as seizure detection software was used to review the EEG. The attending physician reviewed the raw data twice per day and communicated it to the primary the am.

DIFFICULTIES: For the last 7 hours, there appeared to be diffuse artifact throughout the entire EEG with some intermittent pauses where the brain activity could be seen.
DESCRIPTION THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5-6 Hz. There is no normal frontal central beta No normal sleep architecture was seen. No activating procedures were performed. Verbal the background consists of moderate slowing of 5-6 Hz theta with Intermixed delta of1-4 Hz seen throughout the recording. After the first 12 hours, there appeared to be a slight attenuation in the amplitude of the EEG and slightly more pronounced delta slowing.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Continuous diffuse slowing as described above. No seizures or epileptiform discharges.
Heart rate 72.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to continuous mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
