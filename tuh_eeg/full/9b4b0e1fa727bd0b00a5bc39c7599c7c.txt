History:	23 YO FEMALE WITH QUESTIONABLE SZ/ HX. PT HAS HAD NO EVENTS
DURING PREGNANCY,  20 WEEKS?
PT COULD NOT TELL ME WHY SHE WAS HERE.
Medications:	None Reported
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  Diffuse 7Hz theta activity is seen during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
almost continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the temporal (maximum at T5) and
central regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporoparietal, left hemispheric slowing
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  2) almost
continuous focal slowing in the left cerebral hemispheric region.  This finding is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
