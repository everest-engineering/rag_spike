CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed woman with depression, bipolar
disease, polysubstance abuse and seizure on the 17th.
MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9.5 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as some hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
