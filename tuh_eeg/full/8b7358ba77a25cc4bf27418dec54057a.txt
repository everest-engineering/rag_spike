History:	44 YR FEMALE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE, HIV, MRSA, PYELONEPHRITIS
WITH CC OF SEIZURE. TONGUE BITE. PT STATES HAD SYNCOPAL EPISODES
DAYS PRIOR.
Medications:	XANAX, TORADOL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely
and maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  A short sleep latency is noted and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The excess beta may be seen with the use of
benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  The short sleep latency and REM sleep during a routine EEG is
atypical and may be suggestive of  a sleep disorder.
