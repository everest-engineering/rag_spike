History:	48 YO FEMALE DX WITH SYMPTOMS OF VERTIGO AND DIZZINESS. OFTEN
SPINNING WITH THE DIZZINESS, DOUBLE VISION AND VOMITING. MOST
RECENT EPISODE 2 WEEKS AGO LASTING A COUPLE OF HOURS.
Medications:	lisinopril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.3Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces a mild increase
in the amplitude of the background/  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
