History:	46 year old man with right ICH.  Patient remains comatose.
Medications:	Versed, Dilantin, Propofol, Keppra, Fentanyl drip
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity is characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Periods of discontinuity are noted.  They are more pronounced over the right.  No
normal sleep architecture is present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is nearly continuous low
amplitude EMG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Discontinuous background
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 26-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and periods of
discontinuity that are more pronounced over the right. These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates focal
cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  Nearly continuous low amplitude EMG artifact
limits somewhat interpretation of the recording.
