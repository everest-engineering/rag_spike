Medications:	Depacon, Morphine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, best seen over the
left hemisphere  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and sleep spindles
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is associated loss of faster frequencies in this
region.  Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 48
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior, Associated loss of faster
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region
and consistent with the known stroke. In addition there is  frequent focal slowing in the left anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
