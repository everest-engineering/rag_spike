CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed female with a history of seizures, gunshot to the abdomen, and hypertension who presents with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lovenox, Cardizem, Lisinopril, Advair
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 to 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
