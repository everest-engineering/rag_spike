History:	63 year old woman status post aneurysmal coiling, now with episodes concerning for
seizures.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  There is no
clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic alpha,
theta and delta activity.  The background over the right consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta
and delta activity.  Frequent movement and EMG artifacts are observed.  No normal sleep
architecture is present, it appears that patient is aroused throughout the recording.
No clinical or electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
disorganization and continuous moderate-to-severe focal right hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing
is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in over the right.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.  There is frequent movement and EMG artifact that limits
