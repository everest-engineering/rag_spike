CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old gentleman with recurrent seizures, characterized by an electrical feeling in his body.  The patient may have involuntary jerking without loss of consciousness as well as episodes of depersonalization.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Depakote, trazodone, metoprolol, sertraline, Lipitor, morphine, oxycodone, and Keppra (on hold).
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable routine EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is remarkable for a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 11 Hz, but prominent intermittent rhythmic theta was noted in the background.  Hyperventilation produces a prominent increase in rhythmic theta.  Photic stimulation was remarkable for patient movement throughout photic stimulation, but no clear driving response.
Heart rate:  78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Modest background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  EEG monitoring in attempt to capture one of this patient's frequent spells will follow.
