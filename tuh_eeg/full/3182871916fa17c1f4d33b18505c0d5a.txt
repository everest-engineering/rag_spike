CLINICAL HISTORY:   89 year old right handed man with history of right pontine stroke, MI, hypertension, CKD, CHF, CAD, left-sided weakness and subdural in 2005, admitted in the hospital with change in mental status and right basal ganglia bleed.
MEDICATIONS:  Pravachol, Isosorbide Mononitrate, Protonix, Coreg, Proscar.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record exhibits a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen frequently at T3 and occasionally at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Mild generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal bilateral midtemporal focal independent bilateral and midtemporal slowing seen more frequently on the left than the right.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral midtemporal region (left more than right), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In addition, thee is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is also nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
