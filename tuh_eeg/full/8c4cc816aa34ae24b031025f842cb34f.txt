CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old woman with an acute left temporal lobe Infarct and
obtundation.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Norvasc, HCTZ, Toprol, ASA, Plavix, Lipitor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates somewhat disorganized pattern on the right although at times, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm identified. Both hemispheres demonstrate excess theta. The patient is agitated. There are sections of the record with bilateral arrhythmic delta activity. In some sections of the record, It Is possible to identify left temporal delta. Due to the patient's agitation, Ativan is given. There are a hand full of vertex waves identified when the patient is not asleep and there is shifting arrhythmic delta activity on the right mid central temporal region. As the recording continues, the patient is a bit more sedated, there is some muscle artifact and again shifting arrhythmic delta.
HR: 120 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
CORRELATION: This EEG is somewhat slower than the EEG performed earlier this week. There are no prominent epileptiform features. This EEG is more compatible with a bihemispheric process and may be correlated with imaging.
