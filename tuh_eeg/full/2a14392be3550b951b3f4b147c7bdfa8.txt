REASON FOR STUDY:  Differential of seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old woman who is mentally challenged with complicated pregnancy, C-section while she was being born, diagnosed with seizures a year ago.  She has been having seizures possibly every day without twitching.  Zonegran was started, seizures improved.  Also, upper extremity twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran and albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wake detection, as well as seizure detection software, patient notes, and nurses notes were used to review the recording.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7-8 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage 1, and stage 2 sleep, although not all the architecture in sleep is normal and appears to quickly go into slow wave sleep.
Abnormal discharges:  Bursts of generalized spike and wave seen at 2 to 2.5 Hz intermittently with a symmetric onset and lasting 5-10 seconds with no clear clinical correlate reported.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bursts of slow spike and wave, as well as mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen during these 3 days of recording.
