CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old female with post traumatic epilepsy with recurrent seizures in the context of a stroke with left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra, Phenobarbital, Labetalol, ASA, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is relatively drowsy. She has a prominent craniotomy site on the left due to previous head trauma.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  Some portions include a posterior dominant rhythm with a medium amplitude primarily alpha and theta frequency pattern.  Others include intermittent bursts of right occipital sharp waves with focal delta.  This activity is primarily on the right, but does spread to involve the left.  On one occasion the activity is sustained with brief chewing. It does not show characteristic evolution but the prolonged bursts with behavioral changes would suggest that it was ictal in nature.  Following this, the patient drifts off to stage II sleep and abundant right occipital spike and wave activity is observed. The recording concludes with the patient in sleep.  The activity is again quite predominant with brief bursts followed by a sleep pattern.
HR:   70 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Right occipital epileptiform activity.
2. 	Right occipital seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is similar to previous studies, although the epileptiform activity is a bit more posterior.  The epileptiform activity in sleep suggests that seizures may be under recognized.
