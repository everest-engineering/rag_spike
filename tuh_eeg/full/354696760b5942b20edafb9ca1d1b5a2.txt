CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and a stroke in 2006, presents with slurred speech and confusion which resolved in the emergency room.  She has bilateral PCA infarcts as well as small-vessel disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Plavix, Lovenox, Hydralazine, Insulin, Glyburide, Lisinopril Hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic and confused.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz with some frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness and drowsiness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously at F7/T3 and independently seen occasionally at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left anterior temporal slowing.
Intermittent right anterior temporal slowing.
Mild diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of intermittent focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region as well as mild generalized cerebral
dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
