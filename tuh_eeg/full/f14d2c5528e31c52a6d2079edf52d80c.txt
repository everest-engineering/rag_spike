CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed female with intermittent episodes of
expressive aphasia.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 50 microvolt,
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta
activity. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the record producing bursts of higher
amplitude rhythmic slowing. Features of drowsiness include POSTS. In addition, there
is an Increase in beta. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. The patient
starts to drift into stage I sleep with vertex waves at the end of the record.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed.
Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is
needed, a followup study may be considered.
