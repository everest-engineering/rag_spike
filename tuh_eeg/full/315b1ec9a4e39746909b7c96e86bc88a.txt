CLINICAL HISTORY:  84 year old right handed woman admitted with change in mental status and lethargy, hypertension, renal failure, bowel obstruction.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of background theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response with harmonic and supra harmonic driving. Heart rate is 66, occasional APCs.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's medical problems or the use of Percocet can both contribute to the theta described above.
