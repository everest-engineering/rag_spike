CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old right handed man with heart murmur, seizures since 2002, prostate cancer with seizures described as loss of consciousness with generalized tonic-clonic shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Metoprolol, Ropinirole, Colchicine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8.5 Hz and which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures which included hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen during wakefulness throughout the recording.
SLEEP:  The patient did achieve stage 1 and stage 2, but the sleep latency was fairly short and he would quickly go into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that there was a short sleep latency and consideration for a sleep disorder should be placed.
