CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old male with a history of alcoholism, right MCA CVA,
bilateral stroke syndrome with dyscontrol and left-sided numbness and gait disturbance.

MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Gabapentin, Metoprolol, Seroquel, ASA

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is some intra hemispheric
asymmetry. The activity on the left is somewhat disorganized with a 9.5 Hertz alpha
rhythm and a small amount of theta. The right hemisphere is remarkable for more
significant disruption of faster frequency activity. Scant alpha activity and overall a
lower voltage, more featureless pattern on the left compared to the right with smaller
amounts of lower voltage 1.2 Hertz delta. The predominant frequencies in the record on
the left are delta, theta followed by smaller amounts of alpha and beta. Photic
stimulation elicits unilateral driving.

HR: 65 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intra hemispheric asymmetry.
2. Prominent disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
3. Mild disorganization on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Previous EEGs
for this individual were not available for comparison and this is an outpatient EEG.
