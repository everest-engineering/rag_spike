CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed woman with a left parietal tumor and seizures characterized by convulsive activity of the right arm and leg. Right sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Levetiracetam, Atenolol, Benazepril, Amlodipine, Simvastatin, HCTZ, Naproxen, Omeprazole, Klor-Con
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Both hyperventilation and early drowsiness bring out intermittent, rhythmic theta particularly from the left mid temporal region. Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, followed by disappearance of the alpha rhythm POSTS and then the subtle focal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle left temporal focal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. These findings may be correlated with this patient's imaging.
