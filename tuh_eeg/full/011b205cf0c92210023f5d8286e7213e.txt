CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old woman with an episode of "feeling funny and sweating."  Breast cancer, receiving chemotherapy and radiation.  History of right MCA CVA in 2006 with left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Insulin, ASA, Coreg, Lovenox, Ambien, Zocor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a small amount of shifting slowing.  Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The features described above are nonspecific in nature and can be seen in a subcortical
bihemispheric process or even metabolic encephalopathy.  In this individual with a history of stroke, there were no strongly lateralizing features.
