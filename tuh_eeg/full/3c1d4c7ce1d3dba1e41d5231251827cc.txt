CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old right handed man with complaints of right-sides weakness, problems expressing words, not able to walk well with a history of stroke, bilateral right more than left weakness, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Cilostazol, Protonix, ASA, Coumadin, Lipitor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Weakness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  T3 electrode continuous artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 to 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges. Infrequent T3 focal slowing at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.  Please note, there is an artifact over the T3 electrode which may impede better observation of this area.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild left midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region which is consistent with a known stroke in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
