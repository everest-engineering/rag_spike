CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old with ischemic stroke, right arm weakness, slurred
speech. Acute left parietal occipital CVA
MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Hydralazine, Lisinopril, Zocor, Metformin, Glipizide, Ancef
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with excess 7 Hz activity in the occipital regions. There is overall, excess rhythmic theta in the background as well as shifting slowing with a bit more irregular slowing and a bit slower theta and delta in the left hemisphere in comparison to the
right. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. The shifting slowing with leftsided,
focal slowing is more prominent in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Shifting slowing, left greater then right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing is congruent with the acute CVA.
