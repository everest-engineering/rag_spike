CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old gentleman with epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizure with incontinence on 7/1/2014, and typically suffers monthly seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24 minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances under 5 kilohms.  There was no mention of a craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which was identified bilaterally, but is sometimes better identified  on the right compared to the left.  Intermittent rhythmic slowing is noted from the left frontotemporal region with attenuation of faster frequency activity.  There is a single burst of left frontal slowing with right posterior slowing.
Epileptiform abnormalities in this EEG includes left temporal sharp waves, 2 of which are well defined with a clear after going slow wave.  There are handful of more subtle sharp waves, and in addition, almost artifactual looking spikes in the left frontotemporal region and frontal central region 1 or 2 of which are concomitant with eye blink artifact.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing in the left hemisphere with an increase in rhythmic slowing.
Hyperventilation augments the left frontotemporal focal slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited some vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
Epileptiform activity including sharp waves and spikes in the left temporal region, some of which have a somewhat unusual morphology.
Left temporal focal slowing augmented by hyperventilation and drowsiness.
Generous background beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  Correlation with imaging given the focal slowing may be of value.
