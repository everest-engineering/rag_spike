History:	2 YO FEMALE WITH SZ HISTORY, THIS CHALLENGED PT IS NOT ABLE TO
GIVE COMPLETE  HISTORY. " I GET SZ'S"
LAST SEIZURE ABOUT A MONTH AGO? "I HAVE SOME AWARE, 5MIN
SHORTEST, CAN'T MOVE, AND SOME I COMPLETELY FORGET"
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes
Description:
Waking background is mildly disorganized and sharply contoured. A  5-7Hz posterior dominant
rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening was seen.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) produces muscle and movement
artifact. The patient was itchy during photic stimulation.  HR 104
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing. These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Opiates may
produce the theta activity described above.  A repeat study capturing sleep and with medication for
itching should be considered.
