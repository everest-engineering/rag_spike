History:	71 year old woman admitted with left sided SAH status post coiling, who remains
confused and aphasic.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  During
wakefulness, the background over the right hemisphere is sharply contoured consists of moderate
amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity, excess theta and beta activity and underriding delta activity.  AP
gradient is unstable over the right.  There is no PDR or AP gradient over the left.  The background
over the left is a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Delta activity is more pronounced
over the left temporal region.  Overall, EEG demonstrates diffuse underriding delta activity that is
at times semirhythmic.  Patient cycles rapidly between wakefulness and sleep.  Sleep architecture
consisting of sleep spindles is captured.  Sleep spindles are better formed over the right.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, moderate-to-severe, especially over the
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and focal moderate-to-
severe left hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the left temporal region. Diffuse
slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and in the patient
with SAH could indicate vasospasm in the left temporal region.  Diffuse underriding delta activity
suggests increased ICP.  Please correlate clinically.
