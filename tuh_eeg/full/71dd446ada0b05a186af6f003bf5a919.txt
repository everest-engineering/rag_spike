History:	23 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O REPORTED EVENTS OF
UNRESPONSIVENESS AND SZ ( ONSET 4/12) , GIVEN SEDATION, FOUND TO BE
ANEMIC, FEBRILE AND POSS. HEMATOMA. PT SZ HX IS 6 IN THE LAST 8
MOS. POSTICTAL/LETHARGY THAT LAST SEVERAL DAYS. PMHX SIG FOR
Medications:	REGLAN, CEFEPINE, TOBRAMYCIN, PROTONIX, KEPPRA, LASIX
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, continuous, marked frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
