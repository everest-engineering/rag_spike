History:	70 YO FEMALE W/ SUDDEN ONSET LEFT HEMIPLEGIA AND NUMBNESS ON
3/24 WHILE AT ONCOLOGIST OFFICE. PT EXPERIENCED SEVERAL HOURS
OF WEAKNESS W/ SLURRED SPEECH. PMHX: HTN, GERD, BOWEL URGENCY
SINCE RTX  CANCER OVARIAN, DX2010, S/P TAM/BSO
Medications:	DEXAMETHASONE, LOVENOX, INSULIN, KEPPRA.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7.8-8.3Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Bursts of shifting slowing and generalized slowing were seen throughout
the record.  During  drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, shifting
Interpretation:
This is ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The shifting slowing described above may be correlated with the patient's imaging.
