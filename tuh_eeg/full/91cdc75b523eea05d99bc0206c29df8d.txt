CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old woman with agenesis of the corpus callosum, childhood severe refractory epilepsy, failed treatment with carbamazepine, valproate, and with consequences of long-term phenytoin use.  Occasional staring spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, folate, ursodiol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record in a patient who was very drowsy.  This is a technically satisfactory study with impedances less than 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is dynamic.  Some sections of the waking background demonstrate diffuse rhythmic theta.  In other sections, a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm can be seen intermittently and that alpha rhythm may be present in the left or right.  Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.  Some vertex waves maximum to the left or right of the midline.
Hyperventilation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and serve to alert the patient.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage 2 sleep and did not elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting asymmetries including an intermittently asymmetric alpha or sleep waveforms.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's asymmetries may be related to the agenesis of the corpus callosum.  No epileptiform features were identified today.  The background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
