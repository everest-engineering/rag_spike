CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old female with a history of seizures, depression, husband, here for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedure no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the left hemisphere, maximal at times at F7 and other times at T3.  These are seen at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts, very frequently throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent left hemispheric maximal anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
