History:	53 YR MALE WITH 2 ND SZ LOC/FALL/GTC. PT HAD PRIOR SZ 20 YRS AGO.  PT
SUBSTANCE ABUSER.  WAS USING THEN STOPPED 2 WKS PRIOR (XANAX,
HEROINE).  ALSO ON METHADONE
Medications:	FLEXERIL, PRN,  METHADONE, AMLODIPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess theta (7Hz in frequency) during wakefulness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness and with hyperventilation No epileptiform discharges are
present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing and accentuates left midtemporal focal slowing  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, continuous, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left temporal, mid, T3
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to mild diffuse background slowing with
intermittent left midtemporal focal slowing.  These findings are indicative of mild diffuse and focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
