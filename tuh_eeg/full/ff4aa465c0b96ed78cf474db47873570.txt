CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old male who developed epilepsy at age 11, last seizure March 3, with generalized tonic clonic activity, loss of consciousness, tongue biting, followed by exhaustion and confusion afterwards.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.

Photic stimulation was remarkable for both a driving response and photoelectric artifact.

Heart rate 84 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is recommended.
