CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 26-year-old, right-handed woman with mental retardation and multiple falls, which are attributed to her epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. In this portion of the record, there are no clinical seizures recorded by the patient, nurse, or EEG techs.

RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: Wakefulness continues to show generalized background slowing.  In sleep, there are ongoing bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude delta activity.  When the data is reformatted, particularly in sleep, there is an underlying sharp wave identified with some of the bursts.  The activity has an unusual field of spread in an unusual field, and in some montages it appears to be frontal, even perhaps maximum on the left at FP1 and/or bifrontal at FP2, but on other occasions there seems to be spread to the parietal temporal regions, left greater than right. While the bursts on this day of recording are of shorter duration than the initial day, it is a bit easier to identify underlying spike and slow wave activity in association with the bursts.  At the close of the record on the 21st, there are discrete, frontally predominant sharp and slow complexes identified in the background with the use of an average montage.
HR:  48 to 66 BPM.
