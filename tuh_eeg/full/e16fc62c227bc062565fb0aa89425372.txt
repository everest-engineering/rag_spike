AGE: 41 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: Routine, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1351
HISTORY:
41 y.o. Male s/p resection of left acoustic neuroma with brain stem invasion (6/2014), seizures secondary to right frontal contusion and gliosis, treated briefly with Keppra, which was resumed after he experienced a recurrent seizure. Had an episode in 2015 characterized by impaired awareness. Complains of chronic headache and left facial twitch.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
baclofen (LIORESAL) 10 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily. pyridoxine 100 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is occasional mild left temporal polymorphic slowing. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG due to:
1. Occasional mild left temporal polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild left temporal cerebral dysfunction.
If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
