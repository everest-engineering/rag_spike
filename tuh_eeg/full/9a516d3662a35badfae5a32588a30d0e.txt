History:	55 YR OLD FEMALE WITH PMHS SIG FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA, S/P VP SHUNT,
STROKE AND HEADACHES. PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP OF HEADACHES
LASTING OVER 20 MIN. PT DENIES SZ

Medications:	KEPPRA 500MG, VPA 500MG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 > F8/T4 region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
more than right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.
