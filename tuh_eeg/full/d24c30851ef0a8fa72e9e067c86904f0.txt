Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm reached at best 6Hz.  Background activity was characterized by very
disorganized and at times sharply contoured diffuse low delta and theta activity with absence of
the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region.  Intermittent
polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region.  No clear epileptiform
discharges are present. However very sharply contoured waveforms are seen on both anterior
temporal regions.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Disorganization
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural
in origin. In addition, there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  Lastly there is
diffuse background slowing, disorganization and slowing of the alpha rhythm.  These findings are
indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific but
may be due at least in part to a metabolic derangement.
