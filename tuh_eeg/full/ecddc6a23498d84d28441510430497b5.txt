History:	24 YR MAN WITH PMHX: PROFOUND MR, NON VERBAL, AUTISM, IMPULSE
CONTROL D/O, BEHAVIOR D/O, ASTHMA, UNKNOWN REASON FOR EEG, NO
INFO CAME WITH PATIENT. (I FOUND THIS ON EPIC)  PT WAS 1 HR LATE FOR
TEST DUE TO DID NOT WANT TO WAKE UP.  COULD NOT WAKE PT.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, RISPERDAL, LAMICTAL, KLONOPIN, TOPAMAX, TENEX,
BENADRYL, NEURONTIN, VISTARIL, CLARITIN, COGENTIN, ZYRTEC, FLONASE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep
Description:
Limited wakefulness was captured, no PDR noted.  Frequent posterior 25-75uV, 2-4Hz waves are
intermixed with the alpha rhythm.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL sleep EEG because of no normal wakefulness was captured with transient
stimulation. This may be indicative of a sleep disturbance.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
