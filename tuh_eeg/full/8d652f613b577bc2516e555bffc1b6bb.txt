CLINICAL HISTORY:	68 year old male with intermittent episodes of loss of awareness, heart disease, and sleeping pill use.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic simulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is a relatively low voltage pattern with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of
excess background theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background
slowing. This is overall a very low voltage record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:	50-70 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Mild excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified. The background theta can be seen in the context of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The irregular heart rate may contribute to the symptoms described above.
