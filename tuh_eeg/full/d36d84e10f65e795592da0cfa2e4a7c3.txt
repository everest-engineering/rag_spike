History:	63 yr old female presents for cerebral aneurysm angiogram w/coiling, rt anterior
choroidal aneurysm. pmhx sig for cerebral coiling 2007, cerebral re-coiling 2013,
copd, arthritis, gerd.
Medications:	Induction Meds: Propofol, Lidocaine, Versed, Fentanyl, 8000 Of Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As sedation is given the background slows down in frequency to posterior
theta and delta with attenuation at times. However a gradient remains and anteriorly there is some
faster frequencies.  There is no change in the background during the procedure.  No normal sleep
architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Stent deployed at 12:31PM, Coil was
placed at 12:35PM. No changes noted.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG monitoring during an 1 hour angiogram and aneurysm coiling.
