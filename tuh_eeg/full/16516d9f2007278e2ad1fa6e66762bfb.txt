CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old female with dementia, gait disorder, Parkinsonism and evaluate for epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Sertraline, Neurontin, Sinemet, Aricept, Carbidopa, Gabapentin, Levothyroxine, Lorazepam, Omeprazole, Xalatan, Duoneb, Robitussin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has difficulty cooperating with testing and is recorded on a stretcher.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The awake pattern includes frequent eye movement and muscle artifact. Beta activity is identified in the frontocentral regions. The typical morphology of an awake adult EEG is difficult to identify. As the patient becomes drowsy there is a decrease in muscle activity. A chin tremor and snore artifact are noted. The chin tremor is seen throughout the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. As the recording continues, the challenging record is remarkable for some electrode artifact in P fornix.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were technical challenges with this record. There is no epileptiform activity, but POSTS were seen on the left, not on the right, although at that point there were electrode artifacts. This EEG supports diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, but there were no epileptiform features.
