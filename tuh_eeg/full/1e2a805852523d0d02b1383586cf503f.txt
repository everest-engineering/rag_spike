49 YR FEMALE WITH EPISODES OF SHAKING GEN PT AWARE WHEN EPISODES START, THEN NOT AWARE. POST CONFUSED. PT STATES EPISODES STARTED POST 2005. WHEN MOTHER DIED.
xanax


Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, fast variant of the alpha rhythm at 12-16 Hz. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates from 7 to 21 fps.  HR 66

Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous, moderate diffuse

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. No epileptiform discharges were present. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
