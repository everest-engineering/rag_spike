History:	72 year old man with 2 episodes of falls possibly secondary  to seizures.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm and frequent
abnormal QRS complexes with resultant inter-QRS pauses up to 1.5 seconds.
Summary of Findings:
Cardiac arrhythmia
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm and frequent
abnormal QRS complexes with resultant inter-QRS pauses up to 1.5 seconds.  The ordering
physician was made aware of the EKG abnormalities.
