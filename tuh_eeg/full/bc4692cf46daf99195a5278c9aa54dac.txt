History:	58 YR MALE WITH GERD FOUND ON STREET WITH DRUG OD. AT OSH GIVEN
NARCAN THEN FOUND TO HAVE RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS AND SLURRED
SPEECH.   TRANS TO TUH S/P  LEFT. THROMBOSIS. ISCHEMIC STROKE
Medications:	Lovenox, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral fronto-temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 54  There is a continuous T4
myogenic artifact which makes it difficult to appropriately evaluate this region.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild excessive theta during wakefulness,  These
finding is a etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
