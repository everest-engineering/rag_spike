CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male with thrombocytopenia, anxiety, chronic hepatitis C, and declining memory after treatment for hepatitis C.

MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Relefin, Xanax, and methadone.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.  It is a routine outpatient EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low-voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The overall awake and drowsy record is low voltage, and but there is a subtle asymmetry noted with an attenuation of faster frequency noted only in wakefulness and drowsiness only in the right hemisphere, central temporal maximum.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage 2 sleep and did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate slightly irregular 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for,
1. Subtle focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere with attenuation of faster frequency activity and a subtle underlying slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The low voltage pattern described above is not pathological.  The subtle features identified in wakefulness and drowsiness may be correlated with clinical history and imaging.  No epileptiform features were noted.
