CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 81 -year-old woman with a confusional spell, diverticulosis, depression, anxiety, obstructive sleep apnea.
Inpatient Rock Pavilion EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, insulin, Paxil, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was recorded in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.   This is a very drowsy adult.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is quite drowsy.  There is a mixed frequency background with theta and a hint of a theta frequency posterior dominant rhythm with more of a theta delta background.  Stimulation of the patient produces brief alerting with an alpha rhythm of 6.5 Hz and then the patient drifts back towards a drowsy state with generous beta as stated and smaller amounts of delta.  Occasional bursts of medium amplitude rhythmic delta were noted which are in the central regions.  Epochs of stage II sleep include spindles, vertex waves and K-complexes.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a hypersomnolent adult with generous stage II sleep.  The hypersomnolence may be evaluated clinically but the diffuse background slowing described above is a nonspecific finding, most commonly seen in metabolic encephalopathy.
