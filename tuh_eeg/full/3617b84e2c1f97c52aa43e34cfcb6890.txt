CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old woman with increased shortness of breath and productive sputum found to be hypoxic and in respiratory failure and acute kidney failure.  She was found to have decreased movement of the right side and a left MCA hypodensity on CAT scan.  Now she remains less responsive despite decreased sedation.
MEDICATIONS:  ASA, Atorvastatin, Cefepime, Vancomycin, Insulin, Heparin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  When the patient is stimulated, the background improves and at best posterior dominant rhythm can be seen of 8 Hz in between muscle artifacts; however, this quickly subsides and again there is generalized slowing.  No normal sleep architecture was seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves as described above.
Frequent right mid-temporal T4 focal slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent right mid-temporal slow waves.
Generalized slow waves with good reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology, although not clearly consistent with a clinical presentation of a left MCA stroke.  In addition, there
is diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  It may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
