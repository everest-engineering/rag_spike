HISTORY: 39-year-old male with hypertension, recent seven vessel bypass surgery on March 5, 2010, now with an episode of shortness of breath followed by hypertension and unresponsiveness. Evaluate for confusion.
EEG NUMBER: 10-313.
MEDICINES: Atropine, morphine, amiodarone, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. The patient is described as relatively somnolent. He is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is primarily a theta frequency pattern. There was a fan blowing over the patient and intermittently the EEG suggests a spontaneous change in state which may represent an arousal with brief bursts of delta. There is also intermittent, prominent beta activity.
Occasional eye flutter and what seems to be a very subtle head jerking is noted. During these sections of the record, the patient demonstrates some rhythmic frontal delta. No testing was performed during this section of the record with the subtle eye flutter and head jerking. The record ends during this behavior, but at the end, the patient seems to be shifting state with more sustained eye opening, and some movements including movements of the arms that look to be semi-purposeful.
Heart rate 90 beats per minute.
Impression: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An initial pattern which demonstrates background theta compatible with generalized slowing.
2. A later section of the record when the patient seems to be uncomfortable and is demonstrating frontal delta and some tremulousness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Careful clinical evaluation of this patient during these behaviors is suggested as the patient seems to be uncomfortable. Atoxic or metabolic causes at the end of the EEG might explain the pattern described.
