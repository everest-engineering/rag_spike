CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old left handed woman with a past medical history of HIV, cryptococcal meningitis, and MAC bacteremia.  The patient presents to the hospital with change in mental status and generalized weakness.  On 08/09/2012 she was witnessed to have bilateral upper extremity shaking with decreased responsiveness and lack of eye contact.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Zofran, Azithromycin, Moxifloxacin, Ambien, Dapsone.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic low amplitude 7 to 8 Hz theta.  Additional polymorphic theta and occasional delta was observed diffusely.  During sleep, Vertex waves and sleep spindle complexes were captured briefly.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.  A single EKG lead demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at about 100 beats per minute.

FINDINGS:
1. Mild diffuse slowing.
2. Stage II sleep.
3. No epileptiform discharges.

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute awake and asleep EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.  This finding is a nonspecific indicator of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
