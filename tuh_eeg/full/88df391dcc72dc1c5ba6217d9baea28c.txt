CLINICAL HISTORY:   37 year old male with seizure this morning and a history of DVI in 2003.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  EEG was recorded during obtundation.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture or activating procedures were performed or seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Frequent frontocentral sharp waves at times with a negative dipole that is more central and at times more negative towards the left or the right.  At times polyspike were also seen.
Generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Frequent frontocentral sharp waves.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the frontocentral region, likely in a  midline structure causing a discharge that can be seen in both left and right hemispheres.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and in this patient it is likely due to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
