CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman with epilepsy, partialis continua, no longer with jerking of her arm, but still aphasic.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Zocor, phenobarbital, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was awake, but confused.  No clinical seizures were observed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a slightly slow pattern on the right with a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  A high amplitude, left occipital spike is noted.  This has a significant field of spread.  On some occasions it starts at T5 and ends at O1.  It also has some spread to O2.  On other occasions it is clearly maximum at O1.  It may be associated with some arrhythmic  delta.
The left temporal region is remarkable for marked disruption of faster frequency activity and slower, more featureless delta.
Features of drowsiness include slowing of the background from both hemispheres, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly posterior temporal quadrant.
A small amount of periodic slowing in that region.
Relatively frequent left occipital or occipital temporal spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is improved compared to previous studies.  There is no longer a pattern of periodic delta, but the epileptiform activity persists.
The pattern described above may be a postictal or late ictal pattern.   Clinical correlation is suggested.
