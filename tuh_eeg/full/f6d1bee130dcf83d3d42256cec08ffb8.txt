REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with history of nocturnal seizures since 1970, a seizure at night on September 12, approximately 1-2 seizures a year, she had come for her seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Neurontin, Flexeril.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges. The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.

Heart rate 72.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta during wakefulness at a frequency of 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild excessive theta in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
