CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed female with childhood staring spells and question rolandic seizures in childhood, currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an reactive 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta, 8 Hz mu activity is noted, but testing is not performed to confirm this. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing bursts of rhythmic, higher amplitude slowing.  In hyperventilation there appears to be a left mid temporal sharp wave.  Rhythmic and temporal theta is noted as the patient drifts off into sleep.  Frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity is noted at approximately 5 Hz as the patient starts to transition in and out stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frontally predominant 4-5 Hz spike and wave activity primarily in the transition in and out of sleep.
Left mid temporal sharp wave noted at the end of hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This young adult has previously demonstrated these patterns.  She demonstrates an inherited mechanism for epilepsy.  The focal features were noted in some of her childhood EEGs, but not in the more recent studies.
