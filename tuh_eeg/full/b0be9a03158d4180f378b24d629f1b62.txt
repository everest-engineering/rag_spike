History:	55 year old man with seizures.  Patient has bifrontal skull defect, left>right.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9
Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior (AP) frequency-
amplitude gradient with faster frequencies a lower amplitudes anteriorly.  AP gradient is better
formed over the right.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  Drowsiness is captured, but stage II sleep is not reached.
Continuous polymorphic sharply delta activity is present in the left frontal region.  Additional faster
frequencies are observed over the left frontal region (breach rhythm).  No clear epileptiform
discharges are captured but left frontal activity frequently is frequently sharply contoured.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  Occasional F7 electrode artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left frontal, frequently sharply contoured
Breach artifact, left frontal
Other, no clear epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
continuous moderate focal left frontal slowing that is frequently sharply contoured. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal
slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the left frontal region.  Breach artifact is
