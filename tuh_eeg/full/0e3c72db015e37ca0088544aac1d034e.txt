CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old woman with history of unsteady gait and frequent falls while standing up.  She complains of dizziness and right facial twitching followed by being unresponsive.  Her last event was 1 year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, valproic acid, Prozac, and Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 7-7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is low amplitude frontocentral beta activity distributed symmetrically.  There is also massive artifact noted bilaterally in frontocentral region over the most part of this recording.
Heart rate was 60-80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
