CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, on hold.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfied record with seizure and spike detection software.  No definitive clinical seizures were noted in the EPOCH described below, but there was some pushbutton events.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In stage 2 sleep, there are vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.

Interictal Findings:  This record demonstrates almost continuous rhythmic mixed theta-delta from the right temporal region with high to medium amplitude by anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes, maximum at T2.  They may occur as pairs or triplets.

Pushbuttons:  7:45 a.m., 3:21 p.m. and 9:05 p.m.  these pushbuttons appear to have been practiced pushbuttons.  These resembled a background EEG with rhythmic right temporal theta and sharp waves.  At 9:05 p.m., the patient was awake and there is a fair amount of movement, but there is a bit more rhythmic theta from the right temporal region.

Heart rate 60 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  The 2nd piece of 24-hour video EEG recording was remarkable for:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing and right temporal sharp waves.
2. Multiple pushbuttons, which are hard to differentiate from the patient's baseline, abnormal background.
3. Additional EEG recording will continue in an attempt to capture 1 of the patient's events.
