History:	70 YR MALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES. S/P ROBOTIC MV REPAIR 10/2013.
Medications:	DILANTIN, COUMADIN, CRESTOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse 7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior and mid-temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is amplitude attenuation over the right
hemisphere most pronounced in posterior quadrant.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, mild, bilateral diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. As well as
Intermittent focal slowing in the right temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
