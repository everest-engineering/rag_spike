CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 33-year-old right-handed gentleman with history of schizophrenia and hypertension and smoking who presents with left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, hydralazine, Abilify, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 7.5-8.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6.5-7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity noted during wakefulness.  There is attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere.  Drowsiness was characterized by loss of eye blink and muscle artifacts and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Photic stimulation was performed and results in no driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed and results in diffuse slowing most pronounced in the right cerebral hemisphere.  Heart rate was 70-80 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and excess theta activity during wakefulness.  There was also attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right cerebral hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of either toxic/metabolic or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medication or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere is consistent with the patient's history of stroke.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
