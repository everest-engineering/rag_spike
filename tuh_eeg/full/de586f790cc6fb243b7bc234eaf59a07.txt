CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 21-year-old right-handed male with staring spells until age 5, which recurred in 2014.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz, 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with occasional posterior slow waves of youth.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves and spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.  Sleep was not sustained, but multiple brief episodes of stage II sleep were noted.
Photic stimulation elicited driving response at intermediate in faster flash frequencies and then the patient transitions rapidly in and out of stage 2 sleep in the later sections of the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm, increase in hyperventilation.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Remarkable for this individual with spells of drowsiness, this patient seems to transition rapidly in and out of sleep.
