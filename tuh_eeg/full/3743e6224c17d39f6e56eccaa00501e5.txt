CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old male status post lung transplant who experienced
an episode of hypoxia requiring intubation, now has intermittent spells of
tremulousness. Past history of lung transplant, obstructive sleep apnea, HIT syndrome
and skin cancer.
MEDICATIONS: Zofran, Ativan, Klonopin, Metoprolol, Insulin, Simethicone,
Clotrimazole, Prednisone, Protonix, Hydralazine, ISOSORBIDE, Lorazepam, Clonidine, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. The patient is intubated, erythematosus and poor responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of
relatively slow, rhythmic delta and intermittent rhythmic delta. The patient is
intermittently tremulous. The tremulousness is enough to cause the endotracheal tube
to tremble. The muscle tremulousness produces artifact.
HR: 96 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited bedside portable EEG due to muscle artifact, but
normal due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. The patient's
tremulousness was not associated with an EEG change. Because of the degree of
muscle artifact, if epilepsy is an important consideration, then repeat study is suggested.
