CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male with chronic static encephalopathy, behavioral
problems and epilepsy medications.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Depakote, Zonisamide, Levetiracetam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is poorly organized but with
a 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. At times there is posteriorly predominant slowing.
There are some sharply contoured discharges but no definite sharp waves and those
that are identified are seen in the left central and right central parietal region.
Hyperventilation produces no changes in the background. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild slowing.
2. Background disorganization.

CLINICAL Because of the patient's increasing seizures, an
ambulatory EEG monitoring session will be undertaken.
