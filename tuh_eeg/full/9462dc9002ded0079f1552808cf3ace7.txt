CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old gentleman with multiple severe medical problems, refractory
epilepsy. The patient believes that he is seizure free, but the family notes declining cognition.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm. There is
prominent, shifting arrhythmic delta activity in the temporal regions. During hyperventilation, there is a brief run of right temporal sharp waves. This is followed by some bitemporal sharp activity. The overall background demonstrates generate.s beta. Primarily in wakefulness there is occasional left temporal delta, but stage 2 sleep is relatively synchronous with symmetric vertex waves, spindles, and K-complexes. Photic stimulation is performed with the patient initially asleep with some shifting asymmetries, but when awake there is a driving response and then another burst of right temporal sharp waves.

HR: 72 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bursts of right temporal sharp waves.
2. Excess theta.
3. Occasional left temporal focal delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient's previous EEG's were not available to date for
comparison. No subclinical or clinical seizures were recorded. Some of the background
slowing, disorganization, and isolated left temporal focal slowing may be part of this patient's underlying ischemic cerebrovascular disease and polycythemia vera.
