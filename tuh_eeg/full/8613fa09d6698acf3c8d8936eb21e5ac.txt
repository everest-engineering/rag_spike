CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old right handed male with right arm weakness,
numbness, recurrent falling. Patient also has carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 1 0-?0
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the
record. In maximal wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in beta. In this bedside record, there is a small amount of
artifact in the right frontotemporal region.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The individual appears to be excessively sleepy. In
wakefulness the overall background is acceptable for an adult of this age. If epilepsy is
an important consideration, may repeat the study in the lab, capturing both wakefulness
and extended sleep as well as with hyperventilation and photic stimulation may be
considered.
