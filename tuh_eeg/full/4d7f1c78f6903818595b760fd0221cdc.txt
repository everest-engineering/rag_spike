CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed male with intermittent episodes of
vertigo, dizziness, diaphoresis.
MEDICATIONS: Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with an 11 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount
of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Alpha squeak is observed. Head rocking
artifact is picked up at TS-02. Drowsiness is characterized by a theta pattern followed by
vertex waves in stage I sleep. Stage II sleep included vertex waves, spindles and posts
Snore artifact is picked up in the transition in and out of sleep. Photic stimulation is
performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not activate the record.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important
consideration, a repeat study may be considered.
