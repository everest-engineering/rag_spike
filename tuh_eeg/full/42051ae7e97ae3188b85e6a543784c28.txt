History:		87 YR OLD WOMAN R HANDED WITH PMHX.OSTEOPORSIS, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, ASTHMA HTN, NOW WITH A RINGING IN EARS AND VERTIGO PT ALSO HAD A CRANIOTOMY 15 YRS AGO.
Medications:	ASPRIN, SIMVASTATIN,  PLAVIX, LISINOPRIL, FUROSEMIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. No sleep.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is an asymmetry of beta activity, with more pronounce beta activity over the right hemisphere, best seen centrally. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr was 54
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal, mid Breach artifact, right central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. The increased faster frequencies on the right central region may represent a breach rhythm in the region related to a craniotomy or skull defect.
