HISTORY: epilepsy since childhood, including absence seizures, currently seizure free, ITP.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Depakote, lisinopril, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Technical issues for this record include muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation produces some rhythmic slowing, but no definitive spike and wave activity.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging EEG due to electrode and muscle artifact, but it is within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual with epilepsy, in the past 9 years, none of his EEGs have demonstrated focal or generalized spike and wave activity.
