INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an alpha rhythm reaching 8.7 Hz.  There is intermittent, arrhythmia theta noted in the background.  Although there is some head rocking activity, there is a suggestion of some slowing in the posterior region.  Vertex waves are observed as the patient transitions into sleep and then the patient  spontaneously arouses and is talking.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the movement artifact described above, no definitive focal features can be defined.  There were no epileptiform features noted.
