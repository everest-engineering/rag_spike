CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed woman with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. Much of this record includes stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is
somewhat slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 hertz. The patient quickly
transitions into stage II sleep. Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves and
spindles as well as posts. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not activate the record.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. No focal features
are noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study might be of use.
