CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old gentleman evaluated in April 2012 for obtundation, renal failure, hepatitis C and hepatic encephalopathy.  This is a followup study.
MEDICATIONS:  Keflex, lactulose, rifaximin, nitroglycerin, Oxycodone, valium.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG was appropriately organized, but slow with flowing of the alpha rhythm to approximately 6 Hz.  There is diffuse background theta.  On rare occasions, there is a little focal slowing noted from the left temporal region.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.
Heart rate 60 BMP, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abdomen electroencephalogram due to:
Background slowing.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Compared to the previous study, the background slowing is markedly improved.  The rhythmic slowing described above can be due to this patient's underlying hepatic or renal conditions.  No epileptiform features were seen in either EEG.
