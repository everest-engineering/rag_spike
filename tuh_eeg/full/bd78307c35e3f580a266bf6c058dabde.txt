Medications:	ROCURONIUM,ETOMIDATE,FENTANYL,PHENYLEPHRINE,MIDAZOLAM,EPHEDRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As surgery starts the EEG reveals a background that consists of mixture of
diffuse delta with interposed beta that occurs only in bursts of 1-3 seconds with intermittent
attenuation.  As the EEG progresses the background again becomes more continuous mixture of
diffuse delta with interposed beta and slowly becomes slower and more diffusely attenuated as the
patient is cooled. Until the background becomes  symmetrically completely isoelectric.  The EEG
remains Isoelectric for hours and then as the patient is warmed the background slowly become a
symmetric mixture of delta frequencies with some frontal beta until the end of the record.
INCISION 8:34:11 AM,  HEPARIN 8:53:09 AM, Cooling; 9:10AM, SUPPRESSION 9:51AM, CIRC
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 6.5 hour EEG during cooling for a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
