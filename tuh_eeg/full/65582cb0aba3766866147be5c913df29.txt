CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed woman, with past history of cocaine abuse, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV infection, previously evaluated a year ago after 2 tonic clonic seizures.  The patient reports that she is now drug free, but last week had an argument, her hands became swollen and then she had loss of consciousness with generalized tonic clonic activity and a fall.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Meloxicam, Multiple HIV medications, Lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is very low voltage, but there is a discernable 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and successfully produces an increase in the overall amplitude. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves.  Spontaneous arousals include rhythmic alpha frequency activity.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.   This is a technically somewhat challenging EEG in that is a very low voltage study,
HR:    55 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG in our lab for this individual with epilepsy, which does not demonstrate epileptiform activity.  A follow up study using
different techniques may be helpful in characterizing any potential epileptiform activity.  A low voltage record is a normal finding.
