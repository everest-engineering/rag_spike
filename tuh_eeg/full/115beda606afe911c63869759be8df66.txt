CLINICAL HISTORY: 4 year old man with hepatic failure, status post liver transplant, history of closed head Injury. last seizure 5/20/2010.
MEDICATIONS: Cyclosporine, Mycophenolate, Naphthyl, Prednisone, Omeprazole, Bactrim, Keppra, DILANTIN, Econazole, Bactrim, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively slow and featureless. There is a low voltage 6.8 Hz alpha rhythm which Is higher amplitude on the right compared to the left. As the patient becomes drowsy, a breach rhythm is apparent with accentuation of fast activity particularly right central regions. Hyperventilation is performed early on In the record which also accentuates the alpha rhythm with an increase in amplitude on the right. Features of sleep include vertex waves and spindles. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling off to sleep and does not clearly activate the record.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: This is EEG is remarkable for:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Breach rhythm with accentuation of amplitude on the right.
3. Mild slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This E.EEG does not identify epileptiform activity. his contrasts with most of the patient's previous EEGs which were recorded directly following seizures. The background slowing may be due to his past history of head trauma or the co-morbidities associated with organ transplant.
