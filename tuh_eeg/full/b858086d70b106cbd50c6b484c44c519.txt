CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed woman with epilepsy. Her last seizure was 3 days ago, described as a loss of awareness with blank staring for one minute. Memory loss,  mental retardation, hearing loss, hypertension, depression.

MEDICATIONS: Sertraline, Levothyroxine, Naproxen, METFORMIN, Myst Shelly D, Senna, Mirtazapine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was-performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous beta. The overall pattern is somewhat disorganized. In addition, high amplitude spike in the wave complexes are noted in the right centrotemporal region in wakefulness. These are mid to anterior temporal with a generous field of spread and occur with busts of focal slowing and sometimes in pairs. As the patient becomes drowsy, the epileptiform activity becomes more prominent. The activity is really high amplitude in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving bilaterally. At the close of the record; some of the sharp waves and spikes reach 150 microvolts.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude right anterotemporal spike and slow of activity.
2. Associated right temporal sharp waves.
3. Mild disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded.
