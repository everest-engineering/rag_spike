CLINICAL HISTORY: A 59-year-old woman, admitted for stroke-like symptoms with confusion, inability to move the left arm.  Past history of stroke.
MEDICATIONS: None.
I NTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a scant amount of background theta.  Neither hyperventilation or photic stimulation are possible. Sleep was not achieved.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. scant background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The mild background theta may be correlated with clinical features.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat outpatient study may be of use.
