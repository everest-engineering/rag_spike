History:	53 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O EVENT NOTED OF SHAKING OF LIMBS
DURING STIMULATION, EEG TO R/O SZ. PMHX SIG FOR SARCOID, COPD, DM,
A FLUTTER-A FIB.
Medications:	PROPOFOL, FENTANYL, VANCOMYCIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There is an
intermixed beta overlying the delta.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  With stimulation there is a diffuse
muscle artifact seen. The patient appeared to be twitching.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
