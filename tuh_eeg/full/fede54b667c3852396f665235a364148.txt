DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG is markedly abnormal with a high amplitude, chaotic pattern.  Features in this record include triphasic waves, sharp waves noted from either hemisphere.  The EEG intermittently attenuates or transitions to a theta pattern.  There are brief sections in the record when the patient is stimulated where SRPEDs are noted.  Oral automatisms are also observed.
