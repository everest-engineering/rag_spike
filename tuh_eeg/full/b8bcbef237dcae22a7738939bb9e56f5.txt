CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old male with history of seizures described as tonic-clonic with loss of consciousness for a few minutes.  Last seizure was 1-1/2 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.  However, during the recording, there is some frontocentral theta that is slightly sharply contoured as well as some T6 sharply contoured theta not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that there are sharply contoured waveforms of unclear significance, likely not pathologic.  However, repeated EEG with capturing deeper stages of sleep may be beneficial.
