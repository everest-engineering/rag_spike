CLINICAL HISTORY:  80 year old right handed gentleman with memory impairment and a previous seizure which seemed to be reactive to dehydration, now with another event which may or may not have been reactive.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low to medium amplitude.  The overall background is reasonably well organized with an alpha rhythm of 7 Hz.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep.  Sleep is disrupted.  Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG for this adult without epileptiform activity.  The slowing described above is a nonspecific finding.  Of note, this is the third EEG for this individual.  It is similar to the other two with background slowing.  Thus far, no epileptiform features have been identified.
