CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy since age 5.  Seizures began with an aura and then loss of consciousness with eyes rolling back.  Most recent seizure 1 month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta or theta.
Stage II sleep was not achieved, but the patient was drowsy throughout much of the record.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This seems to be a drowsy individual, but deeper stages of sleep could not be achieved.
