SEDATION: None

TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel	electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
international 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory r cord and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .

EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is markedly abnormal.	There is a clear asymmetry.	The right hemispheric demonstrate 111.0 Hz	alpha  rhythm and what seems to be an alpha subharmonic of 5 Hz.	The pattern from the right hemisphere is low-voltage, and there is underlying low-voltage beta and theta. The left hemisphere demonstrates significant attenuation of faster frequency activity and is a  lower voltage theta delta pattern.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	The asymmetry not d previously as not quite	s marked but is still prominent.	Most notably, there is less beta noted on the le!"t


Sleep is not sustained
Generalized slowing is preset. Focal slowing is present.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-Epileptiform) :
None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: Elicited unilateral driving on the right

EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG .

IMPRESSION:
This is abnormal routine EEG.
t1 Marked slowing from the left hemisphere 12 until driving
mild slowing noted on the right

CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left.
In addition, the bihemispheric slowing supports a bilateral process . No epileptiform features were identified.	These findings should be correlated with imaging
