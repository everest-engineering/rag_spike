CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed gentleman status post severe head
trauma, now seizure-free.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Zoloft, Baclofen, Niaspan

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm which can be identified on the left and sometimes on the right. The
right hemisphere demonstrates rhythmic lower voltage slowing. The patient has a
prominent craniotomy defect in the right posterior region, and in addition to some
breach artifacts, there are likely some mid-to-posterior temporal sharp waves, although
there is scant cerebral activity to generate this. Features of drowsiness include an
increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation is partially obscured by artifact and
does not clearly activate the record.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Modest slowing from the left.
2. A markedly abnormal pattern on the right.
3. In the context of a breach rhythm, a question of sharp waves from the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG may be correlated with this patient's imaging.
The sharp waves noted may actually represent an artifact, given the predominant
craniotomy defect. Compared to previous studies, this EEG is markedly improved.
When the patient was sick previously, the epileptiform activity at one point emanated
from the left.
