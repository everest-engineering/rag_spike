CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed woman, 2 months' pregnant with migraine headaches.  Two seizures in 2008 out of sleep.  Previously treated with Topamax for migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 70 microvolts with posterior slow waves of youth.  In the transition to sleep, POSTs are followed by vertex waves and then spindles. Hyperventilation produces occipitally predominant rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits lambda and driving response.
HR:    84 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  We will refer the patient back to the primary care doctor for the slightly irregular EKG.  A copy of the EKG lead in the EEG was printed for the chart.
