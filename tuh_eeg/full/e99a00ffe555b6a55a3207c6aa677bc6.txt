CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with restless legs syndrome for 6 months.  Shaking movements when she is sleeping and right elbow pain.
MEDICATIONS:  Ultram and Mirapex.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory routine 20 minute EEG lasting 20 minutes.  Impedances in the T1-T2 electrodes were slightly higher than 5 kilohms.  The patient was noted to have involuntary movements of her legs when she tried to relax in the EEG lab with some relief when her spouse assisted her.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.3 Hz alpha rhythm noted which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. 9.7 Hz, likely mu, activity was noted but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record which seemed to increase the patient's restlessness in her legs.  Following hyperventilation as she became drowsy with more hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing, intermittent muscle activity was noted.  The patient was not able to achieve deeper stages of sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed with good cooperation.  On one occasion, the patient had a jerk of the right arm and leg, but not while the photic stimulation was present and there was no change in the EEG with the photic stimulation.  A subtle driving response was identified.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  However, as the patient drifts off to sleep she develops muscle activity as would be expected with restless leg syndrome and this
alerts the patient.  Deeper stages of sleep were not obtained.  The pattern described above is the anticipated pattern for an individual with restless legs.
