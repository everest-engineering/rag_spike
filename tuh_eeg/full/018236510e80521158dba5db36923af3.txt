Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Beta activity  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present over the right
hemisphere.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region.  There is an associated loss of faster frequencies.  Intermittent focal sharp
waves are present  with phase reversal and amplitude maximum a F8/T4.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, Maximal in the midtemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent epileptiform
discharges in the right fronto temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic area. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in
the midtemporal region.  This finding is consistent with the known stroke.  No clinical or
