CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old male with left-sided numbness and weakness, right cerebellar infarct and right occipital craniotomy.
MEDICATIONS:  none reported
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  A small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta was noted.  In a transition to drowsiness, there is isolated, right or left temporal theta or delta waves.  There is a prominent accentuation of beta activity noted in drowsiness as well.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 66 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy in this individual with a previous craniotomy.  Breach rhythm is not prominent.
