REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old man with history of seizures and chief complaint of seizure like activity, ran out of Xanax 2 days prior, given Ativan in the ER.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifacts throughout the recording.  There is a 60 Hz artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some  frontocentral beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness seen intermittently at a frequency of 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG due to mild excessive theta during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral  dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform activities were seen.  Please note that there was pronounced 60 Hz artifact throughout the recording which limits the reliability of the record.
