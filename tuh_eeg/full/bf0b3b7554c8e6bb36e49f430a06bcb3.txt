History:	73 year old woman who presented with inability to speak and hemiparesis, tPA
administered.
Medications:	No Sedatives
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is right to left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The
background over the right consists of 8.5 Hz alpha posterior, preserved AP gradient and excess
polymorphic theta activity.  The background over the left consists of 7 Hz unstable PDR and
polymorphic theta and delta activity, especially anteriorly.  Patient remains awake throughout the
No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is nearly continuous EMG
artifact over the left lateral leads.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Artifact, EMG, nearly continuous, lateral leads on the left
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
moderate continuous left hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative focal cerebral
dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  However,
nearly continuous EMG artifact over the left lateral leads could have masked subtle epileptiform
discharges emanating from that region.
