CLINICAL year old woman, status post cardiac arrest with several days of
unresponsiveness twitching In the hospital.
Cefepime, Heparin, Mycamine, Pantoprazole
digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated with intermittent facial
twitching.
DESCRIPTION OF The pattern in this 24-hour period Is more of a generalized,
relatively symmetric with bursts of high amplitude spike activity. There is a bit of
rhythmicity to this with buildup lasting 2 to 5 seconds and then a brief slowdown. There
Is not particularly an transition, more of a pattern that waxes and wanes. but there is clearly
some paroxysmal There are brief periods of attenuation but not as prominent as in
previous sections of Tactile stimulation of the patient does not seem to change the
record. Although are some asymmetries in the record, the overall pattern Is much more
symmetric.
HR: 84bpm
abnormal EEG due to:
1. Absence of any rhythms.
2. A pattern of epileptiform activity with or without facial twitching, which is
generalized in nature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This finding Is part of an ongoing Ictal pattern. The right
frontocentral epileptiform activity seen In the initial records is no longer apparent.
