CLINICAL HISTORY:  Epilepsy with post ictal drowsiness lasting 15-20 minutes. Last seizure two days ago. Right-handed female.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed as this is an awake and asleep record. Previous EEG's are not available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. In addition, there are subtle sharp waves observed in the background. Some of them seem to be right mid temporal but others right posterior temporal. In relaxed wakefulness and accentuated in hyperventilation and drowsiness there are bursts of notched frontal high amplitude 5 Hz activity. Finally, at the close of hyperventilation, left temporal focal slowing is observed.
Heart rate is 60 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background slowing and disorganization.
2.	Right T4 and T6 sharp waves.
3. 	Left focal slowing later in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. There is epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere but somewhat appears to be bifrontal. Correlation with imaging may be helpful regarding the bilateral features.
