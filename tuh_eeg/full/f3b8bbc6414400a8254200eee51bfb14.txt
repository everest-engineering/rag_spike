CLINICAL HISTORY:    35 year old male with a past medical history of seizures since 8 years of age secondary to head trauma. The patient now presents with increasing seizures
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Through much of the record the background EEG
is disorganized. In addition, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with slowing of the alpha rhythm on the left relative to the right. In addition, there are intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta on the left, some of which are sharply contoured. Brief sections of the record includes an awake pattern which is well-organized on the right. Sleep is characterized by bursts of paroxysmal slowing with 13 Hz sleep spindles and stage II sleep. Hyperventilation accentuates  the slowing on the left. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting into stage II sleep and does not activate the record.
HR: 	78 bpm
IMPRESSION:   EEG due to:
1. 	Arrhythmic delta activity from the left temporal region.
2. 	Intermittent left focal slowing and disorganization in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or spikes were seen. This EEG supports a structural process on the left involving gray and white matter.
