History:	61 year old male evaluated to rule out seizure presents with cognitive changes,
confusion, anxiety, memory loss, episodes of body jerking, and an episode of
unresponsiveness.
Medications:	Naprosyn, Mirapex, Klonopin, Zoloft, Flexeril, Lisinopril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by very low voltage 10-10.5 alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Occasional brief diffuse body jerks are
reported by the EEG technologist.  These are not associated with an abnormal EEG correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Low voltage, severe
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Very low voltage does not make an EEG abnormal.  Occasional
brief diffuse body jerks not associated with an abnormal EEG correlate.
