History:	53 year old woman with long-standing epilepsy. Baseline for EMU admission
Medications:	Phenobarbital, phenytoin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Of note there are at least 3
sharp transients seen over the left mid-temporal region, maximal at T3.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a minimal photic driving
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Sharp transients are of unknown significance.
