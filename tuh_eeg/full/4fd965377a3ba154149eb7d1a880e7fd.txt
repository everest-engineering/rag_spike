CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old gentleman with a past history of brain surgery including subdural hematoma, left sided burr hole, readmitted on November 19 for change in mental status and on the 22nd was found to have a recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage requiring ventriculostomy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Depakote, Valproic, Lovenox, Lisinopril, Protonix, Metoprolol, Piperacillin, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Stimulation are performed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is relatively slow. It ranges from medium to low amplitude. It is a mixture of rhythmic theta and slower arrhythmic delta activity.
The activity is slowest and a bit more suppressed in the posterior region, more so on the left compared to the right. While there is some EKG artifact noted In the background, sharp waves are noted from either hemisphere with variable maximum including P3. T4/C4 and occasionally T1. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant background slowing more prominent in the posterior regions bilaterally, left more so than the right.
2. Sharp waves identified independently from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with a previous craniotomy and a repeal EVD, a
breach rhythm may accentuate the amplitude as epileptiform activity. Epileptiform activity was seen from both hemispheres. If additional information is needed, a follow up study may be of value.
