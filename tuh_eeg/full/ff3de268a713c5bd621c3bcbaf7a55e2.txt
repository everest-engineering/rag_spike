CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old male status post frontal subdural hematoma with a
seizure 24 hours ago.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Midazolam, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a
bihemispheric slope pattern with evidence of a craniotomy. There is slower delta on the right than the left with the left relatively suppressed. There is variability in the record. Some sections demonstrate more rhythmic theta. Other sections of the record demonstrate a more suppressed pattern. The patient appears to the technologist to be somewhat responsive. Tactile stimulation produces an artifact in the background.
HR: 150 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Superimposed arrhythmic delta activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric process. If midazolam
is used in sedative hypnotic doses, this might explain this pattern. No seizures were seen and there were overall rare sharp waves.
