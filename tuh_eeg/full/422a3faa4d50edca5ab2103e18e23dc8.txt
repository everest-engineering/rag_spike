HISTORY: 80 YR OLD MALE PRESENTED WITH H/0 HYPERGLYCEMIA, SPEECH ARREST,
PRESYNCOPE AND S/P FALL W/ NO LOC. PMHX SIG FOR OM, CMP 40 %, HTN,
HLD, BPH, CAD.
MEDICATIONS: Zyrtec. Albuterol
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Routine, awake & drowsy. International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T11T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic Alpha rhythm and background activity are low voltage (1 0-25uV), but show normal reactivity to eye opening and attenuate with drowsiness. Symmetric <10uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions in wakefulness. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bitemporal region during wakefulness, Increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. Some burst of frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA) are noted in drowsiness. HR 72 extra atrial beats. Alpha rhythm, slow Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent moderate, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild frontal
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse and moderate bitemporal focal cerebral dysfunction. These findings are nonspecific with regards to etiology. Clinical or electrographic seizures are present -
