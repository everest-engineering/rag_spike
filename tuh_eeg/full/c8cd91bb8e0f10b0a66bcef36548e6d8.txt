CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed female with constant headaches and dizziness with jaw tightening. The patient has body shaking but without loss of consciousness with her headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Fioricet, Meclizine, Cyclobenzaprine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well-organized with a 11 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and some frontocentral theta. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at faster frequencies.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis or epilepsy.
