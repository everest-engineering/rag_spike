TEMPORAL LOBE GLIOMA SEIZURES MORE FREQUENT LAST ONE 4 DAYS
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan, Neurontin

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the independently on the bilateral
mid temoporal region (left more than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing independently
on the bilateral mid temoporal region (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
