DATE OF STUDY:  03/29 to 03/30.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  History of refractory status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had been suffering from refractory status epilepticus with intubation and prolonged obtundation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG at this time is continuous.  The activity is noted from both hemispheres, which is low to medium amplitude with generous beta.  Breach rhythm was noted on the left, and there are 2 areas of epileptiform activity, one left occipital and the other left frontocentral.  The left occipital is periodic in nature, but the left frontal is intermittent and more discreet and occurs out of the breach rhythm.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
INTERVAL IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring session, recorded while medications were reduced, was remarkable for,
An ongoing periodic complex in the right occipital region, which has a slight frequency evolution.
More subtle and intermittent epileptiform activity in the left frontocentral region.
Additional EEG recording will continue as this patient's medications are adjusted.
