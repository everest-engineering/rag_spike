CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intermittent left-sided numbness and tingling, multiple medical problems, paranoid schizophrenia, cardiac disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, glipizide, Protonix, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable awake to stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient seems to be very drowsy, transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep, with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in a very sleepy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  No significant focal features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be of use.
