History:	57 YR MALE WITH HX OF SEIZURES. PRESENTED TO ED ON 6/3/15. PRIOR TO
DISCHARGE FROM ED PT NOTED WITH SZ. PMHX: HEP C, HTN, ETOH ABUSE.
Medications:	KEPPRA, ZONISAMIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Some sharply countoured discharges but not clearly
epileptiform.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  A single left anterior temporal sharp transient
was seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Sharp transients, single, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  The single sharply transient waveform is of unclear clinical significance.
Please note that previous EEGs have described bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves which
where not seen in this study.
