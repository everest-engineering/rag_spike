CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old gentleman with severe mental retardation, blindness, epilepsy, and dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Abilify, Aricept, Tegretol, Mysoline, Lamictal, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable EEG in a challenging individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern with generous beta and scant theta.  Asymmetric eye movement artifact was noted.  There is also a slight asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic slow delta in the right hemisphere in comparison to the left. There are arousals with an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity noted.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Paucity of a normal awake morphology is noted for an adult.
An asymmetry with a bit more slow, lower voltage delta noted on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The slow background supports a diffuse disorder of brain function. The asymmetric delta described above may be correlated with imaging.  The asymmetric eye artifacts is likely related to ocular pathology
