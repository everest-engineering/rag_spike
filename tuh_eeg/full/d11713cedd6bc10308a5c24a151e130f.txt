HISTORY:  This is a 38-year-old woman with right arm and cheek tingling.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 21-channel digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  There is a fair amount of muscle noted in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of muscle and low voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Wicket is noted intermittently in the record.
Heart rate: 72 bpm, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the EEG.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.
