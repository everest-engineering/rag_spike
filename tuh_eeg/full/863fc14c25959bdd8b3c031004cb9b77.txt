ADDENDUM:
DATE OF STUDY:  05/27/2015 to 05/28/2015.
ROOM NUMBER:  772.
MEDICINES:  Trileptal, others.
This is a continuation of continuous video EEG monitoring.
INTRODUCTION:  During this section of the record, no clinical seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in stage 2 sleep.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted.  Deeper stages of sleep were limited.  Intermittent rhythmic slowing was noted in the right mid temporal region particularly on the afternoon of the 27th.
Epileptiform detections:  High amplitude right temporal sharp waves and spikes were noted, primarily in sleep.  These demonstrate some variability.  Most are maximum in the right anterior temporal region.  The phase reversal may include F8, T2, and other more complex discharges with a bifid component and more posterior spread noted particularly in sleep.
Heart rate:  66 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The focal slowing and sharp waves were previously described for this patient.   EEG recording will continue.
