DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 11 Hz alpha rhythm in a pattern with generous beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  Attenuation of the alpha and overall background slowing.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in sleep.  The patient transitions in and out of stage of 2 sleep.

Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep.  Scant driving was noted.
