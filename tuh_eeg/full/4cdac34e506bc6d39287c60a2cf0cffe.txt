CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 26-year-old male with generalized epilepsy, last seizure 6/3/2013 with generalized eye twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Zyprexa, Celexa
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is her third video EEG for this adult.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves.  Some vertex waves are slightly asymmetric, suggesting that head measurement may be slightly off.  The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
Heart rate:  70 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG without sharp waves or spikes for this individual.  There were minor asymmetries, attributable to lead placement.  In this individual with ongoing, uncontrolled convulsions, additional EEG recording may be of value.
