CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old ambidextrous female with multiple strokes, change in mental status and tonic clonic seizure with slurred speech.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Atenolol, Norvasc, Lovenox, Lorazepam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic simulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable record is performed for an individual who is intubated and relatively somnolent. The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern some portions with low voltage activity and frontal beta, but with spontaneous arousals, there is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm. Shifting asymmetries are noted and in this somewhat challenging record, there is occasional right frontocentral delta.

HR: 80 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Excess beta.
3. Question of right focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The general beta may be compatible with the use of
Ativan. There is little in the way of epileptiform activity and given the history of stroke,
focal features are quite modest.
