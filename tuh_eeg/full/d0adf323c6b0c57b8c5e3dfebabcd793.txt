CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old female who was admitted with a change in mental
status and a possible sepsis. was coded 24 hours ago after having been found
pulseless in the IR holding area.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Vancomycin, Ativan, Fentanyl, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG No photic simulation or
hypoventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a very low voltage record with
predominantly delta and theta. There is an artifact with high frequency waves in the
anterior leads. The artifact seems to be more on the right than. the left side. We do see
occasional eye movements. There is evidence for shifting asymmetries and the record
seems to be more suppressed an the left at the beginning of the record. Stimulation of
the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 70 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSIONÂ·: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Severe low voltage theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is suggestive of severe cerebral insult indicative
of a poor prognostic pattern.
