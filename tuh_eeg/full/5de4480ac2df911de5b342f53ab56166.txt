CLINICAL HISTORY:  76 year old man with history of left sided weakness, numbness, and confusion here for a right CVA.
MEDICATIONS:  Induction medications included: Sevoflurane, Fentanyl, Propofol, Rocuronium, Morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system during a right carotid endarterectomy using additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was monitored during the procedure and changes in the EEG were reported to the primary team.
The patient was clamped at 54 minutes into the procedure and unclamped at 1 hour 51 minutes after the start of the procedure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background at the onset of the procedure has a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Intermittently there is some right anterior temporal at F8/T4 slowing.
During the recording the patient is clamped, there is no change in the faster frequencies and after unclamping again there is no change in the background.
IMPRESSION:  Uneventful right carotid endarterectomy.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals an uneventful right carotid endarterectomy.
