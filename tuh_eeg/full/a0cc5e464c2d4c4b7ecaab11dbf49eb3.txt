CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old male with diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac stent in 2002, angioplasty in 1995, who presents with an episode of headache, vertigo, and loss of consciousness with color intensity.  Also noted were right upper extremity twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Rosuvastatin, Lisinopril, Atenolol, HCTZ, Tramadol, Insulin, Metformin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Headache.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  T4 impedance artifacts were noted.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with anterior temporal leads and EKG.  Stages seen were awake, stage I and II sleep.  Activating procedures were done including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens up to a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz with 20-40 mV.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There were frontal central beta rhythm seen.  Sleep stage I and II sleep were seen with normal architecture. Hyperventilation did not produce any abnormal discharges. Photic stimulation did not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG with no epileptiform activity noted.  There was decreased latency during sleep with snoring, which may indicate possible sleep disorder.  Clinical correlation recommended.
