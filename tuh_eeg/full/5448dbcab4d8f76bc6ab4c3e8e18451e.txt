REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 81-year-old man who presented on May 17th after being assaulted and a fall with bilateral frontal subarachnoid and noted to have left arm twitching with intracranial monitor placed in the left frontal central temporal area, recently off sedation from propofol.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat.  The patient was taken off sedation 4 hours before the test.  Propofol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall there is delta slowing with very low amplitude recording.  At times, there are intermittent diffuse muscle movements with the patient biting on the tube or agitation.  No clear focality to this EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.  There is some variability to the EEG and some reactivity.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
