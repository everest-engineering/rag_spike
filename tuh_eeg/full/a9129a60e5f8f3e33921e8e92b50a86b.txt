CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male with Noonan's Syndrome with exacerbation of seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed, Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Lacosamide.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  It is a slow background with lower voltage delta and beta.  Independent high amplitude spike and slow wave and polyspike and slow waves are noted from either hemisphere, but are more prominent on the right.  Some of them look almost like a vertex wave or a K complex.  On the right they are almost hemispheric, but they have a generous field of spread throughout.  As the recording continues, there is a decrease in epileptiform activity.  This is congruent with the patient starting to awaken.  By 7:00 p.m., the epileptiform activity is recurring with bursts of sharp waves and spikes. At 9:43, there is a burst of fast activity from the right hemisphere.  No clinical signs or symptoms are observed with it.

I dictated the other piece of the EEG that follows this, because this EEG was in 2 pieces, so now the impression for the 24-hour video

IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for:
1. A markedly slow and abnormal background.
2. High amplitude spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity, particularly from the right hemisphere.
3. A handful of subclinical seizures which all seem to have occurred while the patient was asleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of underlying severe epilepsy.
