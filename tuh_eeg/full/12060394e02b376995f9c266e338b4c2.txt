History:	28 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O PAIN/PRESSURE IN CENTRAL-
OCCIPITAL AREA OF HEAD ONSET 06/2013 ALONG WITH A FEELING LIKE HE
IS GOING TO FAINT/ TINGLING SENSATION OF BODY ALL LASTING 1 MIN.
YESTERDAY EPISODE.  PT DENIES LOC/FAINTING. SZ HX IN FAMILY FATHER.
Medications:	None.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region, maximal at T3.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
