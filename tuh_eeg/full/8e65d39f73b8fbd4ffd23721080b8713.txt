AGE: 65 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/17/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1683
HISTORY:
65 Â·y.o. male with a recent admission to neurology for right hemiplegia and expressive aphasia referred for routine EEG for evaluation of focal symptoms.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10.5-11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen. Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.
There is frequent left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured.
There is independent occasional right fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
An irregular heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:
Frequent left fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured .
Independent occasional right fronto-temporal polymorphic slowing, at times sharply contoured
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of left > right fronto-temporal cerebral dysfunction.
