CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old man with the onset of seizures at the age of about 12 to 13 years of age.  In the last 20 years seizure semiology has changed.  Seizures are now characterized by an aura of strange sensations followed by loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  During the events the patient has been told that he wanders.  He has multiple events per day, most of them are nocturnal.  Last such seizure was on 01/07/2013.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin extended release 200 mg twice a day and Tegretol extended release 200 mg b.i.d.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves and sleep complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:  No epileptiform discharges to stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
