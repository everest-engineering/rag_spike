REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 39 -year-old woman with seizures, here for followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures  included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta. There is a prominent new rhythm.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation but there were no abnormal discharges.  During photic stimulation, there appeared to be a photic paroxysmal response with fast generalized spike and waves occurring in frequencies of 7 Hz and above.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized spike and wave at 4-4.5 Hz seen in bursts that occurred for almost 10 seconds which appeared to be symmetric, however, at times, there appeared to be a predominance on the left or the right with no clinical correlate clearly seen.  During photic stimulation, there appears to be a photic paroxysmal response as described previously that does not last the photic stimulation for more than 400 mL.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, amplitude 20.63 microvolts.
HEART RATE:  66
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and wave with a photic paroxysmal response as well as occasional left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of epilepsy. The pattern described above may be part of a generalized epilepsy or alternatively it may represent a focal epilepsy with quick secondary bilateral representation. In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction at the left anterior temporal region which is not specific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.
