CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 65-year-old male with insomnia.  The patient sleeps during the day and finds that he falls out of bed at that time, rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Duragesic, Medrol, Ambien, Ventolin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory routine 20 minute EEG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was deferred.  Impedances were under 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes. During the record, the technologist was adjusting electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of background theta and a small amount of frontal central beta.  Chew artifact was noted.
The patient drifts off to brief stage 1 sleep with vertex waves and then demonstrates arousal.  There is some background muscle or chew artifact noted intermittently as the patient becomes sleepy.
Sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically somewhat challenging, but acceptable EEG.  It is abnormal due to:
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The mild background theta is a nonspecific finding which could be related to this patient's underlying neurological illness or medications.  In this individual with a question of an underlying sleep disturbance, a more prolonged EEG may be of use in an attempt to capture deeper stages of sleep.
