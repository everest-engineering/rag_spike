History:	69 year old man who presents with near-syncope
Medications:	zosyn
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm is 8.5 Hz maximally.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency-
amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  There is mild excess of
diffuse theta activity.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region.  Similar
activity but less frequent is observed over the right temporal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, right temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, very mild
Interpretation:
This an abnormal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing, intermittent mild
left temporal slowing and occasional mild right temporal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal slowing indicates focal
cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart
