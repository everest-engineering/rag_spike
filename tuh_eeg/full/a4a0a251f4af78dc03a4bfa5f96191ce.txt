The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a mild diffuse amount of excess of beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient appears to go into stage I sleep during the recording.
Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.  Overall the recording is very low amplitude, but no abnormalities are seen.
