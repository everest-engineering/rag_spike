History:	59 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P FALL ON 2/28. CTH SHOWED
FRONTAL ICH AND SAH
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen.  Background activity is
predominantly slow in delta and theta range intermixed with occasional alpha activity.  There are
bifrontally high-voltage sharply-contoured delta activity, slower on the left, intermixed with
occasional frontotemporal sharp waves.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) frontal
Sharp waves, occasional, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative
of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  intermittent focal slowing in the bifrontal region worse on the left
side.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin.  Occasional epileptiform discharges in the frontotemporal regions (left
greater than right).  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region.
Clinical correlation is indicated.
