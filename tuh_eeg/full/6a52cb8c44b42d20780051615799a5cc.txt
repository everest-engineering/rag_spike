CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 27-year-old with hemoptysis, pulmonary hypertension, right-sided heart failure, and pulmonary thrombosis awaiting thromboendarterectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Aldactone, and sildenafil.


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a routine 20 minute EEG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-defined, 9.5 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm followed by an increase in beta and slow rolling eye movements.

Heart rate 72 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG will be used as a baseline prior to the patient's operative study.
