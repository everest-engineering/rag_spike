History:	58 year old man with a history of seizures since childhood.  Last seizure occurred ~
2 months ago.
Patient has a history of developmental delay.
Medications:	keppra, coreg,percocet,tramadol,ultram,lasix,mevacor, sinequan, proscar,lisinopril,
lopid,flonase,androgel,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by moderate amplitude 10Hz polymorphic alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  There is mild disorganization with poorly formed AP
gradient.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During sleep there is increase in diffuse theta,
POSTS and K-complexes-like waveforms are noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization, mild
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is mildly abnormal 1 hour awake and asleep EEG due to mild degree of background
disorganization. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
