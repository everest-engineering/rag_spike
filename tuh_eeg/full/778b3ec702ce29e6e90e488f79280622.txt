CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 71-year-old male with the abrupt onset of left arm numbness and then uncontrolled movements of the left arm.  Prior radiation therapy and stereotactic resection of metastatic lung cancers.
MEDICATIONS:  Chlorpromazine, Decadron, Crestor, glyburide, gabapentin, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was noted to have a prominent parietal craniotomy scar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are intermittent bursts of bilateral slowing with some arrhythmic delta activity.  This activity is more prominent in the right central parietal region.  In addition, this activity emerges a bit as the patient becomes drowsy.  Other features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in background slowing.
In wakefulness, there is some subtle, underlying slowing in the posterior regions bilaterally, again right greater than left.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Occasional bilateral slowing, more prominent in the right hemisphere.
Right central parietal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or seizures were identified.  The focal slowing described above is congruent with the patient's surgical history.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat, more prolonged EEG may be helpful in search of epileptiform activity.
