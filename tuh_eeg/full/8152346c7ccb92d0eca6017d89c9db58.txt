History:	62 year old man with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and very briefly drowsy 27-minute EEG due to intermittent mild focal
slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
