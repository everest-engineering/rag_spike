CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed woman with a funny feeling in her head for the last 2 years. Episodes last 10-15 minutes. The patient is aware of surrounding and can respond to outsiders.

MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm in a very tense patient with significant amount of muscle and motor artifact. The patient does not relax until the end of the record at which point, she becomes drowsy with anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits driving.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The patient was initially quite tense during the EEG, however, this may be due to many different causes and should not be construed in any way as pathology.
