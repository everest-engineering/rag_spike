CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed gentleman with diabetes and hypertension, syncopal event March 3, after taking tramadol, felt lightheaded.  Past history of a prior event which was similar.  In this most recent event, he was unconscious for 5 minutes and was confused afterwards.
MEDICATIONS:  No seizure medications.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is occasional, isolated right or left temporal mixed theta-delta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic theta.
Vertex waves and POSTs are identified in sleep which is not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The occasional right or left temporal slowing in drowsiness is a nonspecific finding, but can be seen in
those with atherosclerotic disease risk factors.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study with more prolonged sleep can be obtained.
