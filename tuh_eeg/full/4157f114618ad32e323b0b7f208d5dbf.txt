CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old woman who had an episode of incoherent speech and eyes rolling up in the back of her head for 2 minutes on 2 occasions this year, both when she went to view a loved one at a funeral home.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Cardizem, and HCTZ.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory awake and drowsy EEG with by and large appropriate impedances.  It is a greater than 20 minute study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, and there is scant, shifting theta.  The patient starts to transition into stage II sleep as the technologist switches to photic stimulation, and the patient is drifting in and out of sleep during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response was elicited.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
There are rare bursts of shifting slowing noted in drowsiness, not out of the range of normal for a subject of this age.
Heart rate 72-90 bpm, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record, but there is a slightly irregular heart rate which may be evaluated by other modalities.
