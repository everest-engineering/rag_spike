History:	63 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SZS. HTN, FIBROMYALGIA, BPPV. HERE FOR
F/U APPT. LAST SZ WAS ON SATURDAY. "I WENT INTO A DAZE" LASTING
LESS THEN 5 MIN. - SHAKING, -TONGUE BITE, - INCONT. - LOC. SHE HAS
ABOUT 3-4 SZ A MONTH.  HX OF CVA
Medications:	LAMICTAL, HYZAAR, TEMAZEPAM, ASA, COREG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At times this are sharply countoured suspicious for
epileptiform activity.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving..  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, anterior, at times sharply countoured
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal  region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  Previous EEG's done 11/19/2007, 11/04/2008 and 11/20/2008 have
revealed similar focal slowing and additional sharp waves in the left temporal region.
