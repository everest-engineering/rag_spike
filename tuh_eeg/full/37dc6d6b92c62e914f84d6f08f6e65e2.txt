DATE OF STUDY:  08/18/2012-08/19/2012 for 24 hours.


CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, congenital heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, diabetes, and epilepsy since age 12 described as tonic-clonic seizures during sleep, tongue biting, she is slightly confused for a few minutes.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient is currently off Dilantin and on Topamax and phenobarbital.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep stage I and stage II and deeper stages of sleep.  Please note that during sleep, even though she is using a CPAP on video, she has multiple arousals.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 intermittently at 2-4 Hz and at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.

SEIZURES:  None.

EVENTS:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a 4 day study revealed evidence on the left anterior temporal dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was captured.
