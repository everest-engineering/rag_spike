History:	30 YO FEMALE P/W SZ TRANS. FROM EPISCOPAL HOSPITAL. THEY BEGAN
ON FRIDAY WHERE SHE WOULD STARE INTO SPACE FOLLOWED BY HER
CRYING.
Medications:	DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a marked symmetric photic
driving at flash rates.  Hr was 66  During the record the patient started crying and was slow to
respond to verbal and motor commands. There was no EEG changes seen at any point during the
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
