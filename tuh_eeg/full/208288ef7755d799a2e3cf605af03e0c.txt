History:	49 YR FEMALE HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.  PT ARRIVED TUH S/P CARDIAC
ARREST IN MD OFFICE. CPR EMS.  TUH ARRIVAL APPROX 11:40AM.  PMHX:
LEFT PCA INF, HTN, DM, PVD, DEPRESSION NSTGMI, CARDIOMYOPATHY,
1/20/14 RE-HOOK PT FOR LTM
Medications:	VERSED, DOPAMINE, MIDAZOLAM, NOREPINEPHRINE, INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Intermittent background attenuation is seen for 1-2 seconds.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  Periodic generalized but frontally predominant complex polyphasic
sharp waves are present, with a repetition rate of 0.5-1 Hz. At times they have a polyspike
appearance.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 84 with frequent PVC's
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous generalized, Frontal predominant.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of periodic epileptiform discharges and marked diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are consistent with diffuse cerebral
irritability and severe dysfunction, which is consistent with the history of cardiac arrest.
