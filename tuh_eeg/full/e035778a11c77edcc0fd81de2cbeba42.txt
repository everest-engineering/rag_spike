CLINICAL HISTORY:  37 year old left handed woman with tonic clonic seizures on July 31, 2012, left sided weakness and numbness, past history of head trauma and leukemia, bipolar disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Protonix, ASA, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  In wakefulness the background EEG includes a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient is very drowsy with slowing of the alpha rhythm and then brief EPOCH of stage I and stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage II sleep, but does elicit a scant driving response.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The hypersomnolence identified above can be due to sleep deficits or postictal state.
