CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old right handed woman with episode of confusion and verbal difficulty.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ, Metformin, Cozaar, Aspirin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized for an adult of this age with a 10 Hz 50 mcv posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, and a few bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 82 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were noted.
