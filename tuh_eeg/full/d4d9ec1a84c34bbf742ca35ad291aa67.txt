CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old male with slip and fall accident 2-3 weeks ago.  Since this time, the patient has had numbness and tingling in the lower extremities.  The patient was taken to MRI scan yesterday and had an adverse behavioral reaction with dilated pupils, tonic posturing, and severe agitation.  Wife thinks he may have been abusing PCP.  Learning disability.
MEDICATIONS:  Nicotine patch, Ativan, phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed despite the patient's hypersomnolence.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates almost continuous stage 2 sleep with very brief arousals.  Photic stimulation does elicit an arousal with an 11 Hz driving response.
The patient makes a limited attempt at hyperventilation, which serves to awaken him with a relatively low voltage pattern and then is drifting back into stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 960 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for stage 2 sleep in a hypersomnolent patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  The use of sedative-hypnotic medications may play a role in the pattern describes above.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.
