pmhx. htn, depression, anxiety ,anemia, dub, etoh abuse, tinea pedis, 55 cm head
Medications:	Phenytoin, Lisinopril, Alprazolam, Acetaminophen, Dilantin, Ambien, Normodyne
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 10uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
