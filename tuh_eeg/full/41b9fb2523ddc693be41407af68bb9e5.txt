CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old right handed male with a scalp injury. The patient
was struck in the left parietal scalp by a car trunk and had right-sided weakness for 1
month.

MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Lipitor, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Warfarin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of background beta and a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is
characterized by frontally predominant slowing. There is also occasional shifting
slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
2. Disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The background
slowing and disorganization may be correlated clinically. If epilepsy is an important
consideration, a repeat study is suggested.
