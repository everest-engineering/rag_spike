CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is an 81-year-old woman with 1 episode of seizure a week before the EEG with eye rolling, stiffness.  She does not have any past medical history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, lansoprazole, metformin, furosemide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred and photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is mild slowing of alpha and shifting delta activity on the EEG.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  There are no epileptiform discharges on this ECG.
Heart rate is 60 BPM and irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Slightly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to,
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified on this EEG.  The EKG is markedly abnormal.  If seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged followup study can be obtained.  The background slowing and disorganization are nonspecific findings and can be due to encephalopathy, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, or cognitive impair.
