CLINICAL HISTORY:  87-year-old male with bilateral bur holes for prior subdural hematoma, now with acute change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, doxazosin, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  At times, the patient seemed to be somewhat somnolent even when he was awake.  He drifted in and out of sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes at an 8-9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a slight suggestion of a breach rhythm with a bit more beta and seen at times more so on the left.  Head rocking artifact compatible with prior craniotomy was also noted in the right posterior quadrant.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep, and as he does so, occasional focal slowing was noted in the right posterior quadrant or in the left central and occipital regions.
Heart rate slightly irregular 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 20-minute, bedside portable EEG was technically adequate but was remarkable for intermittent, asynchronous slowing, either in the left central parietal and occipital regions or right posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm described above is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  The focal slowing described above may be correlated with the patient's imaging.  Of note, there were some points when the patient was in bed with his eyes closed and may have appeared clinically to be asleep, but the EEG demonstrated an awake pattern.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison at this time.
