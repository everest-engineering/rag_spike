History:	31 YR BLIND, DEAF, SEVERE MR,  S/P MEDULLOBLASTOMA SUBOCCIPITAL
CRANI 9 YRS AGO.  NOW S/P EVAL OF SDH.  REPEAT CT. SHOWED SDH AND
MIDLINE SHIFT..  follow up eeg.  PT HAD EPISODES OF EYE MM LAST PM
Medications:	KEPPRA, ATIVAN (LAST PM)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta  activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is an asymmetry with faster frequencies only seen on the right hemisphere and attenuation
on the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere has bursts of alpha/beta frequency discharges
frequently with no evolution.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 150  The reported eye flickering was not noted on video during
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous, right hemispheric
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  focal attenuation over the left hemisphere, which is
consistent with the known SDH and Infarct in that region. In addition there is severe  diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The beta seen on the right might be due to
medication effect.  No clear clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
