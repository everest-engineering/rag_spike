CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old male with diabetes, cardiomyopathy, alcoholic cirrhosis, neutropenia and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Zosyn, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  The patient was somnolent.  No clinical seizures or other behaviors were noted.  There were no pushbutton events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates as diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta.  The EEG intermittently, subtly attenuates.  Attenuations are on the order of a 2nd or so.  There is a subtle underlying right frontal/frontotemporal sharp waves noted in the background, which has some periodicity in it, but does not evolve.  As the long-term video EEG monitoring continues, the epileptiform discharge becomes more blunted, lower voltage more subtle.
Recording on the 11th demonstrates again a lower voltage, slow pattern with a subtle, underlying sharp waves noted in the right frontotemporal region.
By 8:15 in the morning, although there is some artifact, the overall background is richer in beta.  Intermittent, subtle arousals were identified at the end of the EEG recording.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This bedside, continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for,
An initially markedly slow and featureless background, improving somewhat over the course of the record.
Right frontal sharp waves, low voltage at times periodic.
An improving pattern by the end of the record with arousals.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were identified.  This EEG supports severe underlying encephalopathy.  The background EEG on the 11th remains quite abnormal.  Unfortunately, the sharp waves seem to be resolving.
