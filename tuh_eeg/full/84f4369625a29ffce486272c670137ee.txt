CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman with 1st ever seizures in February 2014, loud cry, then tonic-clonic confusion, found on the floor.  History of depression and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a routine 20-minute EEG with appropriate impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.3 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Generous beta activity was noted.  Knee was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.  Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in the record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study, with perhaps more extensive sleep is suggested.  In contrast to the previous EEG, the patient is not excessively drowsy and is not tachycardic.
