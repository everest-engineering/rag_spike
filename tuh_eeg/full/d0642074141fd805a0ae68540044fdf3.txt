REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 29-year-old man with a history of first seizure described as falling, generalized shaking and foaming from the mouth.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
Heart rate 66.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record reveals limited wakefulness which has a posterior dominant of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  At times there is excessive beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep, meanly the recording is in sleep.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Occasional F7/T3 focal slowing seen intermittently at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG mainly in drowsiness and sleep with left frontal temporal or anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
