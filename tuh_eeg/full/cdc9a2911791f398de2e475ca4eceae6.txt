History:	65 YEAR OLD FEMALE PRESENTING WITH LEFT INTRACRANIAL
Medications:	VERSED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. There was intermittent bursts of overriding beta activity.  No normal sleep architecture
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region.  Intermittent
rhythmic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is reactivity and variability to
visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left midtemporal region
which is consistent with the known left intracerebral hemorrhage. In addition, there is intermittent
focal slowing on the right anterior temporal region which is  indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction
and etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. Lastly, there is also  diffuse
background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators
