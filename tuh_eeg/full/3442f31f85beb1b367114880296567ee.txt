CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed female with a history of hypertension, anxiety, and depression who presents with recent increase in seizure frequency described as an tunnel vision, nausea, staring spells with loss of consciousness, stiffening, and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, HCTZ.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The records opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness as well as stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation accentuated bitemporal slowing, please see below.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 and sometimes intermittently at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times this was sharply contoured but not clearly epileptic.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bilateral slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
