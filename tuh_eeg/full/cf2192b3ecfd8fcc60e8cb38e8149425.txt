CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old right handed female with new onset tonoclonic seizures beginning April of 2009. The seizures occur in the context of stress and depression.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, there is generous beta activity noted in the background. There seems to be an artifact picked up at T5. Wicket activity is identified bilaterally and is more prominent on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is starting to drift off into sleep, and there is no significant
driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. A normal variant; wicket; which is more prominent on the left.
3. Some technical issues with the placement of the T3 and T5 electrodes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If this individual is thought to have new onset epilepsy rather than panic attacks, a follow-up study in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. The presence of the excess beta may be seen in the context of anxiety and stress, which would certainly be present for any individual attempting to have an EEG with 3 small boys. Please contact the lab if needed to reschedule or repeat the EEG with sleep or even 24 hours of home EEG monitoring.
