History:	25 YR OLD MALE R HANDED WITH MULIT FOCAL LESIONS PMHX HIV POSITIVE DIFFUSE TOXOPLASMOSIS. FOLLOW UP EEG.
Medications:	Clindamycin, Decadron, Fentanyl, Morphine, Thorazine, Vancomycin, others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description: Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with attenuated anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At times, there are bursts of FIRDA.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Verbal stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
HR 102.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, moderate frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Compared to prior EEG on 9/10/14, no triphasic waves were seen. This EEG is lower in voltage.
