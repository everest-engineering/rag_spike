History:	26 YR MALE WITH CC OF PANIC ATTACKS.  PT HAD ONE EPISODE THAT
STARTED AS PANIC ATTACH THEN FELT CONFUSED, SHAKING WAS AWAKE
AND ALERT. PT DROVE HIMSELF TO HOSP. WAS TOLD HE WAS FINE.  PT
ALSO SAYS HAD TINNITUS AND DIZZINESS.
Medications:	XANAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess18-25 Hz beta activity is present, maximal frontally.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving,
which at times is supraharmonic.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
