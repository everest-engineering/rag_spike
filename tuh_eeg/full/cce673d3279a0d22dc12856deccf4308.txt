CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman status post coiling of left Acom aneurysm with worsening in mental status on the 28th.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was intubated and at least initially poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern.  This is a dynamic pattern and the initial sections on the 28th are significantly slower.  By the 29th, there is an increase in theta frequency activity and the patient is moving a bit more with spontaneous eye movements.  Overall, the background is bilaterally slow, but slower on the left with more disruption of faster frequency on the left.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Day 1 of continuous EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
A dynamic pattern with improvement over time and a bit more faster frequency activity on the 29th with a more alert patient.
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
