TOTAL LENGTH OF RECORDING:  24 hours
CONDITIONS OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to standard 10/2020 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.  The recording was reviewed at least twice during the recording by the attending neurologist.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a past medically intractable complex partial seizures, currently admitted for presurgical evaluation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat (off) and Lyrica (off).
DESCRIPTION OF RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz, 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, slow wave sleep and REM sleep are captured.  Minimal occasional polymorphic theta activity is observed over the left temporal region.  No atypical events were captured.
FINDINGS:
Minimal occasional left temporal slowing.
No events or seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal 24-hour continuous audio-video EEG monitoring due to occasional mild left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No typical events or seizures were captured.
