AGE: 25 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only EEG #: 15-1626
HISTORY:
25 y.o. female with a history of intractable complex partial epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and Defective Glucose Transporter receptor Type 1 referred for routine EEG as a follow up study.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily. Take two tablets twice a day
ERGOCALCIFEROL, VITAMIN D2, (VITAMIN D2 PO), Take	by mouth
daily. Unaware of dose
clobazam (ONFI) 10 mg Tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth at bedtime. Take 1/2 tab at bed, call if too drowsy
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness s is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9-10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes. Note is made by technician that patient is unable to follow commands to close eyes or attend to flashes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake only routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake only routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
