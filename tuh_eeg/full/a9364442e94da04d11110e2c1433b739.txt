CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old woman with markedly increased hypertension noted in June, the patient wakes up from sleep with loss of consciousness and seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, none others listed.
I NTRODUCTION: Twenty minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and drowsy record. It is technically acceptable with most impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm,which is higher amplitude on the right than the left. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.
Occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity are seen in the right or left, overall infrequent in drowsiness. Wicket was noted as the patient drifts off to sleep. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Hyperventilation appears to accentuate occasional bursts of shifting slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral  driving.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal for an adult of this age due to occasional bursts of shifting slowing and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat, more prolonged study may be obtained. The shifting slowing described above is a nonspecific finding and may be correlated with this patient's overall clinical picture.
