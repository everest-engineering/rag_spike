INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit.  The patient reports no seizures and the nurses and the computer do not identify any clinical seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Wakefulness continues to show well-formed 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness demonstrates rhythmic theta.  In this section of the record, epileptiform activity is only identified in sleep, primarily in stage II sleep with high amplitude, symmetric poly spike and slow wave or spike and slow wave activity often occurring in conjunction with a vertex wave.  The activity is reviewed through a referential and other montages, but no consistent lateralization is seen.  In most cases, the activity is of similar amplitude and onset seems to be identical even at faster paper speed.
HR:  72 BPM.
