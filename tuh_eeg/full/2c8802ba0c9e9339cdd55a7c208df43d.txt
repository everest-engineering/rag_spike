CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old woman who presents with new onset generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.  She had 2 such events.  The first seizure occurred on 12/25/2012.  Prior to the event, the patient stated that she had a headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Ativan, Keppra, Tylenol, and Lovenox.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess diffuse beta is present.  During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with a good effort and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in bilateral symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:  1.	No epileptiform discharges
2.	stage II sleep.
3.   Excess Beta
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 23-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the Neurology team at the time of the dictation.
