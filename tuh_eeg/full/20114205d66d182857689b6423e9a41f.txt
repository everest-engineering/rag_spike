CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old woman with adult onset, refractory complex partial epilepsy, status post presurgical evaluation. The patient feels that well defined tonic clonic seizures in wakefulness are under control, but may continue to be experiencing either subtle seizure in wakefulness or seizures in sleep.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Gabapentin, Albuterol, Welchol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, 15 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of temporal theta and some subtle isolated theta in the right or left temporal region. Generous beta is observed. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
I. Subtle temporal theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted in this EEG. Additional EEG recording may be helpful to more completely capture this patient's temporal lobe epileptiform activity.
