CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed with encephalopathy, myoclonus, status post tracheostomy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Fentanyl, ASA, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates very low
voltage featureless pattern. There are vertex waves but there seem to be a handful of
very low voltage vertex spikes noted in the sections of the record in the way of
muscle and movement artifact. There is also some low voltage rhythmic theta activity
which occurs in bursts, again a little more prominent at the midline. There is some
occasional twitching which produces some artifact.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively low voltage featureless pattern.
2. Very low voltage vertex spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Some of the same vertex epileptiform activity was seen in
the previous activity. There is far less in the way of myoclonus and the activity identified
now is not assessed. The endo myoclonic jerks identified in the record are so subtle and
are difficult to seen on the video and are not associated with epileptiform features.
Overall, this EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
