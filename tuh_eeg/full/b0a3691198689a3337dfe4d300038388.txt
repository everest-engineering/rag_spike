History:	63 y o female with seizures, headaches and memory loss.  Last seizures ~ 2 years
Medications:	Novolog, carbatrol, lantus, risperdal, lopressor, topamax, fosamax,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse beta activity is noted  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges are present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess fast activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
