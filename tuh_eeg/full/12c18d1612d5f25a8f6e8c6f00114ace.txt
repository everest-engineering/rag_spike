History:	26 year old woman admitted with drug overdose and PEA code.
Medications:	no AEDs, no sedation
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of burst-to-suppression pattern, with burst-
to-suppression ratio of ~ 1:1.  Bursts consist of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.
Frontal waveforms are higher in amplitude and sharply contoured and are most prominent early in
the burst.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, 1:1
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL comatose 21-minute portable EEG due to 1:1 burst-suppression pattern and
lack of background reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  In post-anoxic injury, these EEG findings correlate with poor chance of
full neurological recovery.
