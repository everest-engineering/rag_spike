History:	65yo RH woman found down shaking and foaming at the mouth.  She had another
episode in the ED with prolonged post ictal confusion. PMH of right frontal calcified
meningioma and seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent subtle polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness and sleep.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~ 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior, subtle
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG due to subtle intermittent mild-to-moderate left
anterior temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead
