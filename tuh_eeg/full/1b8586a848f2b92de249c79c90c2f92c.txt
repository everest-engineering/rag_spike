CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old female with a history of sarcoidosis status post lung transplant, now with head movements, hypertension, osteoarthritis, vulvar cancer, and here for electrocerebral silence evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Brain death.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the brain death protocol using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while comatose and unresponsive.  To review the EEG, electrocerebral silence montage and double-distant electrode protocol was used.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  EKG artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a completely suppressed background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  During the recording, all the electrodes are tested.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There is no normal electrocerebral activity seen throughout the entire recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is markedly abnormal with the absence of normal electrocerebral activity.  In the appropriate clinical scenario, and in the absence of any sedations, is suggestive of brain death.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
