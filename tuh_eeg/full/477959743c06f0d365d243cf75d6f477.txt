CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 30-year-old male with epilepsy, teenage-onset seizures, admitted to the hospital on July 3rd with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Zofran
INTRODUCTION:  1 hour Prolonged outpatient EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This is an awake and extended sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs noted in sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG in one month for this adult.  In comparison to a previous EEG, 14 days ago, no focal features were identified.  Focal features were identified only  in the acute postictal EEG.

If additional information is needed to characterize this individual's relatively severe epilepsy, additional techniques would be necessary, which may include inpatient EEG monitoring and drug withdrawal.
