Medications:	ECONAZOLE, ATORVASTATIN, NOVOLOG, METFORMIN, NEURONTIN,
CARBAMAZEPINE, DILANTIN, LEVEMIR, LOPRESSOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 7 Hz theta during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness,
the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
