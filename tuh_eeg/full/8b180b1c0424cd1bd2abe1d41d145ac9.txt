History:	47 year old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 17 yo.  Patient with
recent increase in seizure frequency.
Medications:	Depakote, zoloft.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is aborted early as per patient's wishes.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
