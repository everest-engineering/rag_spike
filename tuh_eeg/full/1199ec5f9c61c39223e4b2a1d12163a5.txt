DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm, no normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.  During the recording the patient was stimulated and there was some increase in muscle artifact.
