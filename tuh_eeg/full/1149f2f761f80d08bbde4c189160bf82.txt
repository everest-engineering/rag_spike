History:	43 year old woman with a history of seizures and strokes.
Medications:	Dilantin, paxil, plavix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies and voltage attenuation over the right, especially
temporal/ frontocentral region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right, especially over the temporal and
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG due to subtle continuous mild right
hemispheric slowing and mild voltage attenuation that are most pronounced over the temporal and
frontocentral regions. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
