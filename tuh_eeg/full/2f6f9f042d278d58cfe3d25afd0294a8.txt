SUSTAINED WHIPLASH INJURY 8/29/12 ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL FOR FACIAL
DROOP AND SLURRED SPEECH 12/17/2013  ROUTINE FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	LUMINAL, NEURONTIN, VIT D, ADVIL, TYLENOL, BRETHINE, ZESTRIL,
MEVACOR, HYDRODIURIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
