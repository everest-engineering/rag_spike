CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old male with a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures.  The patient was being discharged from the hospital prior to October 2012, when he had a seizure and fell forward injuring his lip.  Currently seizure free for 5 months.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  There was problematic muscle artifact noted in the records.  This is an awake and asleep record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a relatively low-voltage EEG with 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing the alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements, followed by vertex waves.  Brief spindles were noted in stage II sleep.

Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving with superharmonic driving response.

Heart rate 78 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite the technical problems described above, this is a normal EEG.

This is the second normal EEG for this patient.  No epileptiform features were seen for either EEG.  If additional information is needed.
