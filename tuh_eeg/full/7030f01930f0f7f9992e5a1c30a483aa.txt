CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed male with history of MR, CP, status post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and shunt, seizures as a child, but has not had any seizures for a while, presents with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Moxifloxacin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at P4 continuously at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  This is seen in the setting of a breach.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right posterotemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right parietal region, which is consistent with a known ventriculostomy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
