CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 40-year-old male with schizophrenia and epilepsy with frequent falls.  Admitted with left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  This was a bedside recording.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern.  In maximal wakefulness, there is excess theta.  It is relatively symmetric pattern.  Intermittent, frontally predominant spike and wave complexes were noted.  These may be isolated spike and wave complexes are bilateral and bifrontal 4-5 Hz.  They appear as relatively symmetric, generalized, discharge, or independently in the right or left frontotemporal regions.  Features of drowsiness including increase in background slowing.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, a more generalized spike and wave and polyspike and wave morphology was noted.
Heart rate 140 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the 4th EEG for this individual.  It is similar to previous studies and that it demonstrates:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
Abundant epileptiform activity, which can be frontally predominant spike and wave, almost a polyspike and wave or focal, independent frontal spike and wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given these findings, a secondarily generalized mechanism is most likely for this individual.
