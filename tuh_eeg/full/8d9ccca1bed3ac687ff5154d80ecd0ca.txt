History:	59 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF SZS X >30YRS.  PT STATES HAS HAD AURAS:
DEJA VU, SMELL. NORMALLY WILL HAVE A SZ IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE
MONTH. LAST SZ BEGINNING OF MARCH 2014
Medications:	VIMPAT, VASOTEC, ZOCOR, AMBIEN, CARBATROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces a mild increase
in amplitude of the background.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  This EEG failed to capture right temporal sharp waves and slowing, which
has been seen on the patient's previous studies.
