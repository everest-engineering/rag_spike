CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed male, status post recent resection of large right cerebral tumor. Past history of tumor 10 years ago and chemotherapy. The patient is developing worsening language difficulty, elements of aphasia and increasing left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tylenol, Labetalol,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is able to follow commands throughout the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is modestly slow. The left hemisphere demonstrates modest background slowing with an alpha rhythm reaching 6.5 Hz. The alpha rhythm is a little slower on the right, approximately 5.5 Hz. There is disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere, particularly in the frontocentral regions but the posterior dominant rhythm is preserved although slow.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing through the right frontal region.
2. Background slowing identified bilaterally more so on the right than the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features identified in the record. The degree of background slowing Identified on the left would not be expected to cause aphasia.
