22 YO MALE ADMITTED FROM PRISON FOR MULTIPLE SZ. X 3, LASTING 2-3 MINUTES. HX OF EPILEPSY SINCE AGE 7. HEAD CT NORMAL. MRI OF HEAD UNREMARKABLE. HX OF ASTHMA AND SCHIZOPHRENIA
KEPPRA,  DEPAKOTE
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation,and produces no effect.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
