CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed female with episode of loss of consciousness while driving and a history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures and episode of passing out.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens up to a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz with amplitude of 20-50 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen in stage I sleep.   Photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously in wakefulness.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slow waves.
excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
