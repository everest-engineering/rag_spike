History:	62 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NEW ONSET SZ IN SEPT 2015. S/P
RESECTION OF LT MENINGIOMA ON 12/2/15 . NOW WITH APHASIA.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of beta with increase activity on
the left and higher amplitude.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, anterior
Breach artifact, continuous, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal region and breach artifact.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region and consistent with the known meningioma and surgery.
