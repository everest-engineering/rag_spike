CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed woman status post AVM, seizure free
for the last 10 years.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation brings
out an amplitude asymmetry with an accentuation of the amplitude from the left and a
small amount of slowing. There are also 1 or 2 bursts of sharply contoured slowing as
hyperventilation and with a single, subtle T1 burst of sharply contoured slowing. Photic
stimulation does not significantly activate the record. There is a little bit of shifting
temporal slowing seen at hyperventilation some of which is again sharply contoured in
the left temporal region with more clear sharply contoured slowing in between the photic
stimulation.
HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharply contoured slowing with subtle underlying sharp waves at T1 from the left.
CLINICAL Overall, these findings are similarly to previous studies
although there is less in the way of persistent focal slowing. These findings are
congruent with her previous surgical history. The shifting slowing is nonspecific and
maybe age-related or related to the previous neurosurgical history.
