History:	74 year old man with right hemispheric hemorrhage, now status post evacuation.
His mental status remains poor and he has episodes of agitation.
Medications:	Keppra, Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left hemisphere consists of 8 Hz PDR, poor AP gradient and excess
polymorphic theta activity.  There is no AP gradient and no PDR over the right hemisphere.  The
background over the right consists of polymorphic attenuated theta and delta activity.  During brief
drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates over the left and increase in diffuse theta
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Irregular heart rate is noted on a single
EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and focal
continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing and attenuation. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and
attenuation is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region with a suspected fluid collection
between the skull and the brain (such as empyema, hematoma).  Irregular heart rate is noted on a
single EKG lead.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
