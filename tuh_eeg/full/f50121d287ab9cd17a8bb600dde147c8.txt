History:		58 year old woman, POD#18 after left carotid stent. Now presents with confusion, change in mental status, and word finding difficulties. Undergoing evaluation for seizures.  PMHX: CVA 2010, RIGHT HEMIPARESIS.
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type:
NEURONTIN, PLAVIX, ZOFRAN, INSULIN, CARVEDILOL
None
Awake & asleep
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and has fair organization with a 7-Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm and theta slowing. Sleep transients, including vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles, are symmetric and normal.
There is occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing. No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. A heart beat of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Other, continuous, mild diffuse, suboptimal organization Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of occasional polymorphic left hemispheric slowing superimposed on mild diffuse background slowing and suboptimal organization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left hemispheric cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in origin, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
