LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 75-year-old man admitted with fevers and chills, subsequently found to have acute kidney failure.  The patient also developed respiratory disturbance, and underwent a 7-minute PEA code approximately 1 week ago.  The patient remains with poor mental status.  Past medical history is notable for CHF, diabetes, hypertension, dementia, and others.
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol, heparin, insulin, Prograf, Protonix, aspirin, amlodipine, carvedilol, hydrocortisone, prednisone, Unasyn, and atorvastatin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude mixture of theta and delta activity.  __________ are captured; however, normal sleep architecture is not observed.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates QRS complexes of 2 distinct morphologies.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 24-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Two distinct QRS morphologies are noted on the single EKG lead.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
