History:	76 year old man status post severe head trauma, now with abnormal movements.
Medications:	keppra and neurontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, lethargic
Description:
During maximal arousal, the background consists of low amplitude polymorphic 8.5-9.5 Hz alpha
activity with weak AP gradient.  Patient rapidly transitions to sleep.  Sleep is characterized by diffuse
theta and delta activity, periods of discontinuity and FIRDA ((frontal intermittent rhythmic delta
There are intermittent low-to-moderate amplitude bisynchronous occipital sharp waves with
aftergoing slow waves.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over the O1 and O2 leads.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Sharp waves, intermittent, bilateral occipital
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and mostly asleep 22-minutes portable EEG due to mild diffuse
slowing and intermittent bisynchronous occipital epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient
could be related to excessive drowsiness (given the fact that patient rapidly transitions from arousals
to sleep).  There is a potential epileptogenic focus over the bilateral occipital regions - please
