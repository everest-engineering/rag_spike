CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old male with basilar artery aneurysm and multiple posterior circulation strokes.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of diffuse background slowing. It is overall a relatively low-voltage slow pattern, significantly slower on the right compared to the left. In addition, although there is some wicket-like theta frequency activity on the left, there are a handful of well-defined sharp waves or bursts of sharply contoured slowing on the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
3. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. These findings may be correlated with imaging. The sharp waves suggest a predisposition to seizures.
