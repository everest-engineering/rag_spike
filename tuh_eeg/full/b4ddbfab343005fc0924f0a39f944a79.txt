History:	28 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF PROLONGED SZ. GTC/ LOC GIVEN VERSED TRANSFER
TUH. IN ED HAD ANOTHER SZ. RIGHT UE SHAKING AND HEAD TO RIGHT.
PMHX: GSW HEAD LEFT (S/P CRANI 7/13). PER PT NEVER HAD SZ BEFORE, HIV
Medications:	KEPPRA, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemispheric region maximal at F7 and C3
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Beta generalized
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent focal slowing in the left temporal and central
regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in
origin.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
