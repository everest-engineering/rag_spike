68 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH SLURRED SPEECH LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS. PMHX SIG FOR OLD CVA RT ( 2008) , HTN, DM, HLD, DEPRESSION METOPROLOL
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region (right more than left) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (R>L) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal region (right more than left). This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. electrographic seizures are present.
