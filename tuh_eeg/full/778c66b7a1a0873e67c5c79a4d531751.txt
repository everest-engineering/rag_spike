CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed woman with diabetes, hypertension and stroke with left facial droop, an episode of staring, facial droop and speech arrest.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed but hyperventilation is not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing particularly in the posterior regions. The patient drifts into stage II sleep during photic stimulation which does not otherwise activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. disorganization
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered.
