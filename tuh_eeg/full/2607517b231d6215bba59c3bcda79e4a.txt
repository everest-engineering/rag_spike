AGE: 32 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: routine EEG, awake and drowsy EEG # : 15-1315

HISTORY:
32 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for a history of seizures.

MEDICATIONS:
Depakote

SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.

EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.

During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.

EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.

OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None

ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :

Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.

Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.


EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.

HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.

IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG due to:
1. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing

CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are nonspecific indicators of left temporal cerebral dysfunction .
