DATE OF STUDY:  March 27, 2014, to March 28, 2014.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old male with extraordinarily refractory status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, Ativan, propofol, phenylephrine, others, phenobarbital, vancomycin, cefepime, Versed taper.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Patient was intubated and sedated, and comatosed throughout the EEG, but during different this 24-hour section of the record, sedative hypnotic medications were gradually reduced.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The EEG began on the morning of the 27th with the continuous pattern.  There is an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a mixture of theta delta with some sharply contoured activity in the right frontal region.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a breach rhythm with arrhythmic delta, particularly left posterior temporal and a T5 high amplitude spike and wave complex with some polyspike activity.
There is variability in the record, some sections are more vigorous in terms of the quantities of fast activity.  In some points, there is more arrhythmic delta from the left posterior temporal region and the quantity of sharp waves or spikes is variable.  There was no definitive or clearly evolving ictal pattern noted at this time.
Throughout the overnight recording, with stable doses of medication, the overall pattern is relatively stable with the pattern rich in beta, the rhythm and sharp waves in the left posterior temporoparietal region.
Additional EEG recording throughout the early morning hours of the 28th demonstrated stable pattern, essentially unchanged.  Occasionally, there are some more left frontal sharp waves.
Stimulation of the patient at 10 a.m., on the morning of the 28th, did seem to have a brief alerting effect.
By the afternoon of the 28th, again stimulation of the patient once again seem to produce some faster frequency activity, but no epileptiform features.
Heart rate 88 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 12th day of  continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for a stable pattern with pharmacologic coma, but prominent epileptiform activity.
