CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old female presented for a left carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Induction Propofol, Fentanyl, Midazolam.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a 3-hour CEA montage EEG. At the beginning of the record, the patient is awake with lambda waves. A half-hour into the record, the patient develops more of a beta pattern as she is falling asleep. There is anesthetic induction. There is some head rocking. During sleep, there are mixed beta, theta, and delta waves with intermittent discontinuity. Heparin is given at 2:42 p.m. There is discontinuity in the EEG. With clamping, there is no significant activation of the record. There are no focal features. There is suppression in the posterior regions. After clamping, there is increased attenuation of the left greater than the right in the frontotemporal regions but no significant difference. There is mild attenuation of 3-5 second pattern. In the left frontotemporal region, there is some slowing greater than on the right. Later in the record, the left side becomes more continuous. After unclamping, the record becomes increasingly continuous. The pattern is confirmed by Doppler study.
HR: 60 to108 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG during left carotid endarterectomy shows intermittent discontinuous pattern. There are no significant changes seen after placement of clamp. Of note, the EEG leads were not glued on. This was an add-on emergency case. Duration of study is 3 hours from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.
