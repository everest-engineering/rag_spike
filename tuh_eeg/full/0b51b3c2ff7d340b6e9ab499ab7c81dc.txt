CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed woman with significant bilateral ischemic cerebrovascular disease with likely seizure with blood glucose of 50.  Past history of syncope versus seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Keppra, Zocor, Lisinopril, ASA, Protonix, Donepezil
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is very disorganized.  The patient is not moving much, but has frequent eye blink.  The overall background is slow, disorganized with asymmetries.  There is slow at 6 to 7 Hz, alpha rhythm on the left than the right, but there is more focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly frontocentral region.  In this sharply contoured record, there are a handful of left frontal sharp waves which are distinguished from eye movements and other artifacts. Features of drowsiness include a decrease in motor activity and an increase in slowing.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
Focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly the frontal region.
Disrupted alpha, more so on the right than the left.
Rare left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  The left frontal sharp waves suggest a focal mechanism for seizures.
