CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed male with a past history of epilepsy,
now experiencing memory loss.

MEDICATIONS: Neurontin, Gabapentin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10..20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Lambda is Identified in
wakefulness. Vertex wave.s, K complexes, spindles and posts are identified in sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 60 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be considered.
