CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old woman admitted for long-term monitoring. History of left MCA, aneurysm repair in 1998 at MCP.  She presents with seizures since April 2003.
MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Heparin, and nicotine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standing 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is very subtle focal slowing as well as a breach rhythm identified in the left temporal area.  However, this subtle difference became less prominent in hyperventilation. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Rare sharp activity is seen in the left temporal region during drowsiness. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing in the left temporal region with occasional sharp activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates focal features, which may be partially responsible for the seizure activity in this patient.  Continuous long-term video EEG monitoring may be able to reveal more information regarding her seizure type.
