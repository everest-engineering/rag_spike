50 y.o. female with a history of	FOCAL SEIZURES SINCE 10/14.	SUBSEQUENT TEMPORAL LOBE LESION FOUND PER PT.	SEEN AT EINSTEIN BUT SWITCHING TO TUH.	HAS STARING SEIZURES MANY A WEEK FEELS WEAK AND TIRED POST. PMHX: HTN, COPD, SEIZURES.
ANXIETY, DEPRESSION. TIA ( referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 1 mg tablet, Take 1 mg by mouth 3 times daily.
fluoxetine (PROZAC) 20 mg capsule, Take 20 mg by mouth daily. tramadol (ULTRAM) 50 mg tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth as needed for Pain.
Zolpidem (AMBIEN) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth nightly. simvastatin (ZOCOR) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth nightly. multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
CETIRIZINE HCL (ZYRTEC PO), Take	by mouth as needed. Onfi, Ambien, Xanax, Fioricet, Symbicort, others
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. Marked background beta was noted.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep was not sustained but drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta and an accentuation of focal slowing, described below
Right temporal focal slowing is present. Â·This was seen intermittently in wakefulness, accentuated in hyperventilation and drowsiness.	Characteristics include bursts of somewhat rhythmic delta and theta with disruption of underlying alpha frequency activity
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
In the bursts of sharply contoured slowing, there is generous beta but no definitive sharp wave or spike
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and accentuates focal slowing in the right temporal region
Photic Stimulation: Subtle bilateral driving EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during
this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to
#1	Bursts of intermittent sharply contoured right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Although there is occasional, shifting temporal slowing, the major feature in this record is of right temporal focal slowing which is sharply contoured.	These findings may be correlated with the clinical history and imaging
