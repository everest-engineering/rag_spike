History:	34 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF AUDITORY HA AND PARANOID ETIOLOGIES.  X2 DYS.  PMHX: PITUITARY TUMOR, OSA, CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROME, NEUROPATHY, MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, HTN, COPD, PULM FIBR, ESRD (MWF), KIDNEY TX, PCKD, HYPOTHYROID, CVA X8 YRS.   PRIOR EEG 2006.
Medications:	TRAMADOL, CYMBALTA, SEVELAMER, MIDODRINE, SENIPAR, ABILIFY, TOPIRAMATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, drowsy
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. The EEG was mainly during stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hr was 102
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and mainly asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The EEG reveals a short sleep latency this may be indicative of a sleep disturbance, however clinical correlation may be helpful
