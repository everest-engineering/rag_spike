CLINICAL HISTORY:  Young woman with bipolar disease, severe; malignant hypertension; past history of seizures, poorly described, perhaps seizure free for 20 years, admitted with intracerebral hemorrhage with midbrain component.  Intermittent obtundation or depressed mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Risperdal, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  The patient was relatively drowsy at the start of the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the pattern begins, EEG is compatible with a light sleep pattern with a mixed frequency pattern.  POSTS were noted.  There are bursts of shifting sign and slowing can be noted in either hemisphere.  Tactile stimulation of the patient seems to accentuate the asymmetry and that there is a bit more delta at least on 1 occasion, on the right than the left.  A repeat attempted tactile stimulation produces an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity bilaterally.  Repeated tactile stimulation unclearly produces an alerting response briefly and then the patient drifts off to a light sleep state.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Twenty-minute bedside EEG is remarkable for:
Relatively drowsy patient who demonstrates some morphologies of normal sleep with POSTS noted bilaterally a little bit more prominent on the right.
An intermittent arousal pattern on some occasions, tactile stimulation particularly producing an arousal pattern on other occasions unable to do so.
Significantly less focal slowing than anticipated given clinical history and imaging.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a history of epilepsy, no epileptiform features were identified.  The hypersomnolent pattern described above may be related to the neuroanatomy of this patient's intracerebral hemorrhage.
