CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old male with very large, congenital, left hemisphere AVM, episodes of early morning right arm shaking without loss of consciousness, depression, hepatitis C.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Topamax, and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with seizure and spike detection.  The patient reported no seizures during this section of the record.  He remained quite active.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness the EEG is somewhat slow from the right hemisphere.  Intermittent slowing is noted from the left hemisphere which may be subtle or more marked with arrhythmic delta.  Sharply contoured slowing is noted, particularly at T1.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.
Heart rate:  72 BPM with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring was abnormal due:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere seen at times continuously, at times intermittently.
Infrequent left temporal sharp waves noted primarily in drowsiness and sleep.
Mild slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The mild slowing on the right may be due to this patient's underlying medical conditions (hepatitis C, hepatic encephalopathy, or the diffuse affects of the giant AVM).
