History:	51 year old woman with a history of seizures since 31 years of age.  Last seizure
occurred on 11/6/2014.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Frequent 50-75uV, 100 msec positive sharp transients occur bilaterally over
the occipital regions of the head during saccadic eye movements with the eyes open.
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary
to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges are
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
