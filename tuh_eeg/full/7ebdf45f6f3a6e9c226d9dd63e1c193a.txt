CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old male with syncopal spell while watching television.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION: 40 minute  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7-Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of alpha rhythm with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and posts noted in stage-2 sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation produced scant driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep with early transition to slow-wave sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were seen.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and if this patient is thought to have seizures, a repeat study may be of value.
