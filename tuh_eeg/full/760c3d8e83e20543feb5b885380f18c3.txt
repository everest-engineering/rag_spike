CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old right handed woman who had a stroke in 2009 with a left hemiparesis.  She was hospitalized in December after an episode of diarrhea with twitching of her left hand.  MRI demonstrated no new strokes.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Neurontin, Tramadol, Lisinopril, ASA, Synthroid

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and a sleep record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age.  There is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are age-appropriate, occasional bursts of focal slowing, isolated beta or delta as the patient transitions off to sleep.  In addition, there is intermittent, focal slowing characterized by focal theta or delta waves in the right hemisphere with some right temporal sharp waves with a generous yield of spread and disruption of faster frequency activity.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  At the close of the record as the patient drifts off to sleep, POSTs are noted.  In addition, focal features including disruption of faster frequency activity on the right are noted.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharply contoured slowing from the right.
2. Focal slowing from the right, particularly as the patient transitions into sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features described above are not as prominent as they were during her recent hospitalization.
