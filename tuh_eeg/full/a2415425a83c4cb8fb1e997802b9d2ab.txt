CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old woman with abdominal pain cardiac arrest in the field with asystole, dementia and COPD.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing began, the patient is intubated, comatose in the ICU. The overall pattern is a suppressed pattern. There are intermittent burst of theta noted from the right or left hemisphere almost as if the patient has islands of cerebral activity. The burst of theta with some mixed delta maybe symmetric, asymmetric, unilateral or bilateral. They are not associated with any change in the patient's background or behavior. Stimulation of the patient occurs during the time of the patient's bursts and does not particularly active the record.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly abnormal anoxic brain pattern which is similar to a burst-suppression pattern with a markedly suppressed pattern
2. Intermittent bursts of unilateral or bilateral theta
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern, 24 hours after cardiac arrest, carries a worrisome prognosis. There was little in the way of reactivity or variability. The paroxysmal burst merit clinical observation to make sure that there are no clinical motor behaviors of any nature.
