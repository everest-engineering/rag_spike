CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old woman with Xanax withdrawal seizure on January 21st, 9 days after Xanax cessation.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record, although there is some muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with supra-harmonic driving.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The generous beta described above may be due to this patient's medications.
