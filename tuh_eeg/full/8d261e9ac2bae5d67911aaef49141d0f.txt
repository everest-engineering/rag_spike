CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old left handed woman with lupus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, DVT, pulmonary embolism, seizures, renal failure, depression and abdominal abscess, evaluated for acute left-sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Keppra, Benadryl, Tylenol, Zofran, Flagyl, Dilaudid, Cefepime, Coumadin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a dynamic pattern with rhythmic background theta frequency activity primarily a 6 Hz pattern interrupted by bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude frontal delta to 2 to 6 seconds duration. Tactile stimulation produces an increase in delta. In addition, there are a handful of triphasic waves observed in the record. There are these subtle, periodic sharp waves observed in the right parietal region on occasion. Shifting asymmetries are noted in the background.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. A very metabolic appearing pattern with bursts of paroxysmal frontal delta.
3. Triphasic waves.
4. Occasion periodic sharp waves in the right parietal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The right parietal sharp waves may be correlated with imaging. No seizures were recorded.
