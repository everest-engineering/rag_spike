CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old woman with fibromyalgia and an acute episode in which the patient feels like her jaw is tense.  She is extremely fearful and worried that she is about to have a seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  IV Tegretol, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  There was no hyperventilation or  photic stimulation as the patient was very concerned that these would precipitate a seizure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  When the patient is anxious there is a fair amount of muscle artifact.
Heart rate 60 to 90 BPM.  Rare PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in this record.  The generous muscle may be seen in an anxious patient.
