CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with a 1 year history of nausea, vomiting and dizziness after cardiac catheterization.
MEDICATIONS:  Crestor, Plavix, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation increased the amplitude of the background.  Features of drowsiness including increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
