History:	57 year old man who has a history of left cerebral AVM, status post craniotomy.  Left
facial twitching was recently noted.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is continuous ~2 Hz moderate
amplitude EMG artifact that affects primarily left hemispheric leads, specifically, left frontopolar
leads.  EEG technologist reports intermittent left facial twitching and perioral twitching - there is no
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No electrographic seizures
Artifact, EMG, continuous, rhythmic at ~ 2 Hz, L>R
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute portable EEG due to minimally slower
posterior dominant rhythm, than that expected for the patient's age. This finding is indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No electrographic seizures are
present.  Left facial and perioral rhythmic subtle twitching are only associated with rhythmic EMG
artifact - please note that only ~ 25% of simple partial seizures are captured on the scalp EEG.
