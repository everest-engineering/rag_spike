CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 20-year-old male with developmental delay, evaluate for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was difficult to console.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of frontal central beta.  The overall organization of this record is remarkable for slight disorganization.
Hyperventilation was not possible.
The patient remained somewhat anxious through the record with generous beta.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Slight disorganization for an adult of this age.
Generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  To more completely characterize this individual's epilepsy, consideration for a more prolonged, sleep study is suggested.
