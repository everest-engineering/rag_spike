REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 47-year-old man who was in the hospital for multiple complaints, has renal failure, seizures, alcohol abuse and liver disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, darbepoetin, thiamine, nifedipine, sodium, bicarbonate, atorvastatin, metoprolol, Calcitrol, ferrous sulfate, folic acid, PhosLo.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that does reach a 7.5-8 Hz, which appears somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation caused accentuation of focal abnormalities, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges, but photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen frequently at T3, at times slightly rhythmic at a frequency of 2-4 Hertz and, I believe, of 20-60 microvolts.  Please note that this was accentuated during hyperventilation.
Seizures: None.

Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to mild slowing of the background as well as left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction as well as focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
