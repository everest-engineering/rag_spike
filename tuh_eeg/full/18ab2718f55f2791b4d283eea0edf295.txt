SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 7.8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. The maximally waking background demonstrates mild excess theta and mild disorganization for age. During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
!fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by spindles and vertex waves
Mild generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is
present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.
Mildly slow background.
There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a mildly abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to mild slowing for a subject of this age.	This was not as
prominent in the prior study, but the patient was sleepier.	EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
