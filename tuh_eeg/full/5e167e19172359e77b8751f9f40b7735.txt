:
History:	56 year old female with 1 week of right side weakness and speech difficulty.
Symptoms improved slightly in a week.
Medications:	PROTONIX, ZOCOR, HEPARIN, COLACE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates
with eye opening.  PDR is better formed over the right.  Anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude
gradient is present over the right only.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left midtemporal>frontal regions.
This activity is often sharply contoured, particularly over the midtemporal region.  No clear
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds and produces no effect.  Stepped photic stimulation
from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.  Occasional
premature QSR complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left frontotemporal, most pronounced over
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous moderate left
temporal>frontal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
No clear epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Occasional
premature QSR complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
