CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old left handed man with intractable epilepsy status post VNS stimulators presents for seizure classification.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Topamax, Lacosamide
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video 24 hours monitoring EEG was performed at bedside for 20 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement syndrome with additional arterial, temporal, and EKG electrodes.  Continuous seizure detection software as well as bi-detection software was utilized and supplemented by a patient-activated alarm, nursing observation, and testing.  The video/EEG files were reviewed on a daily basis.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm at 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening with a normal frontocentral beta.  All sleep stages are captured.  For the first 20 minutes, photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed with no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Bursts of generalized spikes and waves seen at 4 to 4.5 Hz with anterior predominance and bursts of 1 to 3 seconds.  At times, the bursts seem to have a right frontal leading and at times a left frontal leading, but mainly they are symmetric.  No other focal spikes were seen.
SEIZURES:  [captured or patient event captured]:  No seizure events or patient events were captured during this first day of recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of generalized spikes and waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings in this recording are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  Although some of the bursts are asymmetric, no clear focality can be seen to suggest a primary focal lesion with secondary bilateral asynchrony.  No seizures were captured so far in the recording.
