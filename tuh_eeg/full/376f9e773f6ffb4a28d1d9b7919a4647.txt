CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old male with paranoid schizophrenia, auditory and
visual hallucinations, and a single blackout spell with shaking.

MEDICATIONS: Folate, Singulair, Risperdal, Celexa, BenztropineÂ·

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens the patient seems quite
nervous with frequent eye blink. The alpha rhythm does achieve 8.5 Hz.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in slowing of the
background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. This record does contain somewhat
more 7-8Hz activity than would be normally anticipated In an adult of this age.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a mild disturbance of cerebral function.
It is just outside the limits of normal for an adult of this age. No epileptiform activity was seen in this EEG or in the previous study.
