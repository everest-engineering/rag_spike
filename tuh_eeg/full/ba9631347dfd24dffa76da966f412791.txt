CLINICAL HISTORY:  An elderly gentleman with recent status epilepticus associated with hyponatremia.  The patient was discharged home.  He missed his medications and returned with facial twitching, drooling, worsening aphagia, and hemiparesis.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was as described above.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The activity from both hemispheres is slow.  In addition, there is a high amplitude periodic complex with a little bit of polyphasic activity.  This discharge is noted in the left hemisphere with a wide field of spread and is typically maximum in the left posterior temporal region, T5, but may also be noted at P3, O1, T3.
With stimulation there is an increase in theta frequency activity on the right.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
The appearance of high amplitude periodic complexes from the left hemisphere with a broad field of spread.
Significant slowing on the left.
Moderate slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were recorded.  The pattern of PLED's was previously noted for this patient, but did abate.  Additional EEG recording may be of value to determine response to therapy.
