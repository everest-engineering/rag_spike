History:	43 year old man who presents with two episodes of loss of consciousness.
Medications:	NO AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing and diffuse bursts of moderate-to-high amplitude polymorphic theta
and delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric
photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
