CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman with craniopharyngioma, cardiomyopathy, stroke, right intracranial stenosis.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Protonix, Heparin, Fioricet, Hydralazine, Dexamethasone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. Patient is tearful but confused.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern rich in delta and smaller amounts of theta activity. There is some arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, a bit more so than the left, and rare right midtemporal sharp waves.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. More subtle focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
3. Rare right temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The marked rhythmic background slowing may reflect the impact of the large mass. The focal slowing is in the region of the patient's stroke, and the right midtemporal sharp waves support a focal mechanism for seizures, congruent with this patient's history.
