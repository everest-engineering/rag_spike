History:	64 year old man found pulseless, now undergoing hypothermia protocol.
Medications:	Propofol, 1x dose of Ativan 2MG at 9AM on 07/25/14
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background is severe attenuated with occasional bursts of
polymorphic theta and delta activity.  There is continuous EMG artifact in bifrontal< bitemporal
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a single
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, severe
No reactivity
Artifact, EMG, continuous
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This a very abnormal 24-minute EEG due to severe burst-suppression pattern and lack of reactivity.
These findings are indicative of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  There is continuous EMG artifact in bifrontal< bitemporal leads that limits EEG
interpretation.  An administration of a paralytic agent would improve this artifact and the quality
and interpretability of the recording.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
Patient will be placed on a long term EEG monitoring.
