CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old woman with PRES syndrome, eclampsia, admitted with 2 seizures and a past history of a single childhood seizure, now with blood
pressure under control and resolving proteinuria.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Labetalol, ASA

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is quite drowsy, but coherent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intermittent, somewhat slow pattern. Bursts of rhythmic frontally predominantly delta are observed. In addition, there are occasional bursts of slower more arrhythmic delta activity in the occipital regions. As the patient transitions into stage I sleep, vertex waves are observed. Photic stimulation is performed while she is relatively drowsy, but she does alert and there is brief driving response.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background much slower than expected for age.
2. FIRDA.
3. Occasional occipitally predominant delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. In this individual who appears to be improving clinically, a followup study looking at her improvement over time may be useful.
