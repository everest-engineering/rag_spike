CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed woman with history of ovarian cancer, history, left brain cancer as well as a total abdominal hysterectomy in 2008, presents with vertigo, blurry vision, found to have multiple brain mets.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Lorazepam.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, although the patient is confused.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  No posterior dominant rhythm is actually seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-80 microvolts.
Focal slow waves intermittently at F8/T4.
Diffuse slowing seen at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left hemispheric delta maximal in the midtemporal region.
Intermittent right anterior temporal slowing.
Diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a focal structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region, which is consistent with a brain metastasis.  In addition, there is evidence of focal intermittent focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region which is also consistent with a known metastasis.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
