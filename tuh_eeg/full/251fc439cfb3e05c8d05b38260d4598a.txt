History:	45 YR MALE WITH RIGHT NECK MASS/TRACHED/NECK CA WITH BLEEDING.
RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY STENTING.
Medications:	VERSED, FENTANYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
The background was diffusely slow with intermixed alpha and excess beta and intermittent periods
of diffuse attenuation.  There was a brief period of diffuse loss of faster frequency lasting 5-10
seconds.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  At 12:29 PM the first coil was
deployed. At 12:42 the last coil was deployed. There was no associated EEG changes.  HR was 80-
Summary of Findings:
, No asymmetric EEG changes during study were noted.
Interpretation:
This was an uneventful 2 hour EEG during angiogram and procedure. There was evidence of
intermittent attenuation and diffuse slowing and also a brief period of loss of faster frequencies
which may have been related to medication effect or blood pressure changes. These findings were
conveyed to the primary team during procedure.
