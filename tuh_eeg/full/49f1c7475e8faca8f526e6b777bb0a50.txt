CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old woman with long history of epilepsy, but recent Keppra dose reduction followed by blackout spells, eyes open, but not responsive.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute outpatient EEG with impedances under 5 kilo ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age.  The patient is primarily awake with frequent eye blink artifact.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements.  Heart rate 54 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness to drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is similar to previous EEG.  This is the second EEG for this adult without epileptiform activity.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study is advised.
