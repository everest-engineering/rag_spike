History:	60 year old man with a history of seizures and TBI. Patient with a recent
breakthrough seizure.
Medications:	BACLOFEN, CELEXA, KEPPRA, DILANTIN, ,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Voltages are diffusely very low.  The background consists of a very low amplitude 10.5 Hz alpha
activity posteriorly with expected AP gradient.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.
Symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are present.
Continuous subtle polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal, subtle continuous delta
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Low voltage
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 26 minute EEG because of continuous subtle focal
slowing in the right frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in
this region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
