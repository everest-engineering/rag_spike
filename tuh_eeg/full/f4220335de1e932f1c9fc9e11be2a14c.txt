Medications:	No meds
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Background activity was characterized by diffuse 6-7 Hz theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Nearly continuous polymorphic theta and sharply contoured delta activity are present in the left
frontal region during wakefulness.  There is left frontotemporal breach rhythm.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 70-80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Breach artifact, left
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Disorganization
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
continuous focal slowing in the left frontal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
