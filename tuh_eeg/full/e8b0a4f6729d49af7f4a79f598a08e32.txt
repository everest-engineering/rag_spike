CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old woman with 1-month history of shaking spells, the patient has tremulousness and loss of body stability for which she is amnestic, also experiencing increasing memory loss and confusion.  Hepatitis C, diabetes, COPD, anemia, vitiligo, and depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Nexium, simvastatin, Lexapro, metformin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a subtle asymmetry noted with disruption of faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region relative to the right.  This is slightly accentuated by hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due subtle asymmetry noted in drowsiness and hyperventilation with attenuation of faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of cerebrovascular disease or structural or functional pathology.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
