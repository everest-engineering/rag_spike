PMHX: ETOH ABUSE
Medications:	ATIVAN DRIP (YESTERDAY 6/7),  LASIX, CIPRO, HEPARIN, FLOMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present at times and at best reached 6Hz.  Background activity
was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology
are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase
lag and  at times can be seen with a periodicity of 1-2 Hz.  At times there are some sharply
countoured waveforms that do not appear to be epileptic.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to auditory
stimuli.  HR was 84  Technical difficulties: There was continuous movement artifact during the
entire study.
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, nearly continuous
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Disorganization
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited EEG because of frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and
severe diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
