CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed gentleman with panic attacks and tonic-clonic activity. Six episodes in the last year. Past history of alcohol and drug abuse, now in rehabilitation.
MEDICATIONS: Xanax and Methadone.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with rhythmic theta, particularly in the central and temporal regions. MU rhythm at 11 Hz is noted. A 9-Hz alpha rhythm is also identified. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 40 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. This patient's medications may play a role in the pattern described above. Additional clinical correlates may also contribute to the slowing observed.
