History:	73 YO FEMALE WITH SUDDEN ONSET AMS. PT WAS UNRESPONSIVE.
PMHX; STROKE, LEFT FRONTAL TUMOR, NO SURGERY
Medications:	Mannitol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, comatose
Description:
In limited wakefulness the PDR reaches 6-7 Hz.  Background activity  in limited wakefulness was
mainly characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Frontal Intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is
seen.  Some stage 1 and 2 sleep architecture is seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66 with PAC's and PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
