CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  The same medications as the previous day.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is hypotensive on pressor support.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is low voltage and slow.  Intermittent seizures are observed.  They begin with fast activity in the posterior regions identified bilaterally, but a bit more on the left.  Loss of electrode integrity occurs overnight, but the seizures can still be identified through the parasagittal electrode.  This is a posterior focus, but with involvement in the central and parietal regions.
The background EEG remains markedly slow.  Recording is ended at 8:16 a.m. on the morning of July 5, 2012.  At this time there are prominent occipital spikes, more so on the left than the right.  At the end of the EEG recording there is a low voltage mixed frequency pattern.  In the brief section with good quality recording, the last seizure was at 8:13 a.m.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG demonstrated a status epilepticus pattern with seizures either from the left hemisphere or with a generous field of spread left posterior quadrant, but bilateral occipital.
Interictal spikes with variable maximums, some of which were on the left, but some of which were bilateral occipital or multifocal in the left hemisphere.
Marked background slowing.
Intermittent burst suppression.
These findings were communicated to the clinical team.
