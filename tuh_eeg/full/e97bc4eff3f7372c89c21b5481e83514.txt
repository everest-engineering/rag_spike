CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old male with multiple bilateral stroke syndrome, intermittent unresponsiveness on the 29th, subsequently requiring intubation.  Recently on Versed drip.  Frontal and basal ganglia infarcts.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Pantoprazole, Heparin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated, poorly responsive.  The patient's Versed drip was stopped 1 hour prior to the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow with primarily a delta frequency pattern.  There are shifting asymmetries with some sections with greater delta on the right, but later a little bit more on the left.  There are 3 right frontal sharp waves noted in the record.  There is small degree of variability observed.  Auditory and tactile stimulation produced a small amount of theta.
HR:    104 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
Shifting slowing.
Rare right frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The right frontal sharp waves are in the region of this patient's most recent stroke. They are subtle findings.  No seizures were recorded.
Ongoing evaluation as this patient's sedative hypnotic medications are withdrawn may be of use.
