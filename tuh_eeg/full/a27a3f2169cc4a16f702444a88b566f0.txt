MEDICINES:
Lacosamide, Zofran, Versed, Fentanyl, and many others
HISTORY:
A 50-year-old male with pancreatitis, comatose, bilateral temporal abnormalities.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel of
EKG. The patient is intubated poorly responsive and receives status epilepticus medications during the record This
section of the record utilizes a seizure and spike detection and spans from July 20, 2011, to July 22, 2011.
JULY 20, 2011, TO JULY 21, 2011 . This section of the record demonstrates a slow featureless pattern with high
amplitude periodic complexes and some electrographic seizures with waxing and waning of epileptiform activity in the
right posterior quadrant, including T6, T4, 02, T4. There is an intermittent suppression noted
The patient's medications during this 24-hour section were not provided. There are sections of the record, where there IS
more theta frequency activity emerging from the left, including 10:18 p.m. There were some sections of the record where
the EEG is somewhat discontinuous. The epileptiform activity continues to wax and wane including 6/28/42, and the
pattern at that time was compatible with a seizure. At times, the activity seems to be spreading to involve the left
temporal region, and that is again seen at 6/38.
