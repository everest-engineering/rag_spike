History:	37 year old man with severe head trauma and subsequent hypoxic brain injury.
Medications:	KEPPRA, FENTANYL DRIP
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Voltages are diffusely very low, especially over the left.  There is
right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with more attenuated background over the left.  Frequent
broadly based frontally predominant sharply contoured waveforms with triphasic morphology are
captured over the right.  On the left, blunted frontal delta activity is seen concomitantly to those
waveforms.  Additional, diffuse slow delta activity and periods of discontinuity are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no clear change in the
background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, bilateral (L>R) diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, left
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Other, frequent waveforms on the right that could be epileptiform
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal comatose 22-minute portable EEG due to (1) severe diffuse background
slowing and attenuation that are more pronounced over the right and (2) frequent frontally
predominant sharply contoured triphasic-like waveforms over the right. These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Attenuation over the left
could be secondary to the fluid collection between a skull and a brain (such as SDH, empyema) or
between a skull and electrodes (such as scalp edema) - please correlate clinically.  Right frontal
waveforms are of unclear clinical significance - continuous EEG could be of benefit to better
delineate their etiology.  No clear clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
