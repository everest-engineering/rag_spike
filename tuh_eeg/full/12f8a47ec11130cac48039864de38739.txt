CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed female with Solo's Syndrome, epilepsy.
The patient has sharp, frontal headaches lasting for a few hours not alleviated by
medications but reports no seizures since 2008.
Topamax
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of excess theta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record
producing rhythmic frontally predominant theta. This is followed by drowsiness with an
Increase in rhythmic slowing and then vertex waves as the patient transitions into stage
I sleep. Prominent frontal beta is noted in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves are
somewhat irregular in morphology but not otherwise lateralizing. Photic stimulation is
performed while the patient is asleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
2. Very mild background disorganization.
CLINICAL There were no epileptiform features observed today.
Previous EEGs are not available at this time.
