Medications:	KEPPRA, LORAZEPAM, LOPRESSOR, LEVODOPA, HYDRALAZINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the background attenuates, and 5-
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid and anterior temporal region.
Independent, intermittent, polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid temporal region.
Occasional right mid and anterior temporal (F8/T4) sharp waves are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 84
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, right temporal, F8/T4
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, marked, right temporal, mid and anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, marked, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, bilateral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of anterior and midtemporal slowing and
sharp waves which are consistent with a focal irritable structural lesion in that region. In addition,
there is evidence of  independent, intermittent left midtemporal focal slowing and mild diffuse
slowing which are indicative of both focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction and are nonspecific with
