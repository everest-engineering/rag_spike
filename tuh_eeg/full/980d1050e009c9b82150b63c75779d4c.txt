CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year right handed female with headaches, numbness in tongue and fingers, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Imitrex and Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an extremely drowsy patient transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  In stage 2 sleep vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts are noted. Hyperventilation is performed while the patient is somewhat drowsy but does produce some slowing.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep.  No driving response was noted.
HR:    54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in a very drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration an EEG monitoring session may be considered.
