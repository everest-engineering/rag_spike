CLINICAL HISTORY:   82 year old man with COPD and CAD with left arm weakness and transient shaking, found to have lung cancer with metastatic lesions in the brain.
MEDICATIONS:  Carvedilol, Lovastatin, Theophylline.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating seizures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently in the central region, maximal at C4 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  At times, these are sharply contoured but not clearly epileptiform
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right central region which is consistent with the known metastasis to that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
