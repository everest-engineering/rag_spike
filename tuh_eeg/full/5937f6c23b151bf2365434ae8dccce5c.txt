REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old female with new onset seizures in December 2012 but possibly beginning in October, described as left sided tingling of the arm and mouth followed by left turn gaze, garbled speech lasting for 20 minutes.  Denies loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 impedance or electrode artifact.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, guaifenesin, PhosLo, metoprolol, atorvastatin, hydralazine, furosemide, folic acid, amlodipine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation but not hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens up to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in sleep stage I and stage II.
Heart rate:  72.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  These were seen intermittently.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to right midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
