CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old female who presents with weakness episode of loss of consciousness, and head turning with urinary incontinence concerned for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta-activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized with disappearance of the alpha rhythm slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
