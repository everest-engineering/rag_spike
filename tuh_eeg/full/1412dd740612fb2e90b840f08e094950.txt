AGE: 47 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 95819, 24 minutes
EEG #: 15-1291
HISTORY:
47 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for epilepsy since childhood, now with vibrating spells in sleep, bilateral hand weakness. Prior TBI. ? Schizophrenia risk? Prior EEG 2005 x 2 and 2012, n/a.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions: ciprofloxacin HCL (CIPRO) 500 mg tablet, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-300 mg Tablet, ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 600 mg tablet, MINTOX 200-200-20 mg/5 mL suspension, ondansetron (ZOFRAN) 4 mg tablet,
ranitidine (ZANTAC) 150 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
Diclofenac Sodium 1 % Gel, Apply 2 g topically 4 times daily as needed.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed
utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of Â·EKG , HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	Wicket is seen in drowsiness
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
Intermittent brief 3-6 second bursts of 9 hz activity disrupt the sleep record, without producing a clear arousal.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No definitive epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
Wicket
9 Hz generalized discharges in sleep ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: does not activate the record Photic Stimulation: bilateral driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an unusual but likely normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is the 4th EEG patient for this patient.	Not all prior studies are available for review. The alpha frequency activity in sleep is generalized but has slight frequency evolution.	It	May represent a normal variant.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of
epilepsy.
