AGE: 43 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 10/12/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, Awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1505
HISTORY:
43 y.o. male with a history of hepatitis B and reported grand mal seizures referred for routine EEG for evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions :
divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet , Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth daily.
naproxen (NAPROSYN) 500 mg tablet , Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily as needed (back pain) .
divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, 1 tablet in am and 2 tablets in pm
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive low voltage fast frequency posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates during drowsiness.
During drowsiness diffuse background slowing is seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Awake and asleep one-hour routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and asleep one-hour routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
