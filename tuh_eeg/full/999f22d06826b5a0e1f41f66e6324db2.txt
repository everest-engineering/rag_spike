CLINICAL HISTORY:  s/p TBI: Head and neck trauma now with involuntary lower extremity movements, past history of Halcion-related seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Baclofen, B12, and Lamictal 300 mg twice daily.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of diffuse theta and a small amount of beta.
Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm, below 8.5 hertz, in a subject of this age.
Modest excess theta.
Small amount of excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are nonspecific, but may reflect medication effect or other diffuse CNS process including DAI.  Testing was performed to insure that the patient was maximally alert when the alpha rhythm was tested.
