REGARDING EVENT. PMHX SIG FOR CVA W/ RESIDE LT SIDED WEAKNESS, HTN.
Medications:	Lorazepam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
Background activity was characterized by diffuse poorly formed anterior posterior     gradient and a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz which was attenuated with eye opening.  There is diffuse excess theta activity of 7Hz during wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 80
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
intermittent focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
