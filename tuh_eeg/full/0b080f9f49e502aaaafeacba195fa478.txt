History:
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
with intermixed diffuse alpha- beta frequency discharge.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 114  Patient had frequent continuous eye movements.
Summary of Findings:
Other, diffuse excessive alpha beta
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The intermixed diffuse
fast activity may be suggestive of a medication effect or may be seen with a midbrain dysfunction.
