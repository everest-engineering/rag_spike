History:	52 year old woman who presents with cerebritis and recurrent seizures.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 4/28/2014 till 4/29/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of attenuated polymorphic diffuse delta
activity with underriding excess fast activity.  Periods of quiescence are captured but no normal
sleep architecture is present.
No seizures are noted.
There is significant diffuse EMG artifact when the patient is awake.  That makes interpretation of
those portions of EEG unreliable.  Occasional ventilator artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EMG, severe at times
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Other, some reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour continuous video EEG because of severe background slowing and
attenuation.  This finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  There is significant
diffuse EMG artifact when the patient is awake.  That makes interpretation of those portions of EEG
unreliable.  When compared to the prior recording epoch, this EEG demonstrates clear background
reactivity.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
