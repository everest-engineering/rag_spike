CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male with expressive aphasia, generalized weakness, change in mental status.

MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Lovenox, Lisinopril, Pantoprazole

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG includes a well organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm on the right. On the left there is disruption of faster frequency activity in the left frontal temporal region, as well with rhythmic 2-3 Hz delta  activity and disruption of the alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of sharply contoured slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left frontal temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above support a structural process on the left involving gray and white matter. No epileptiform features were observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study is suggested.
