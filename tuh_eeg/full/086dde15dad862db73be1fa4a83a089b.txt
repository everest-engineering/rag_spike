CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old right handed male with multiple stroke risk factors
who had 2 confusional spells on 01/26.
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. At the close of the record, toward the end of the record, there is occasional intermittent rhythmic slowing from the left temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent focal slowing from the left midtemporal region which is at times a bit sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no sharp waves or spikes in this EEG. The
focal slowing seen on the left is a nonspecific finding. It can be seen in the context of underlying cerebrovascular disease. In this individual with a possible seizure, a follow up EEG may be of value.
