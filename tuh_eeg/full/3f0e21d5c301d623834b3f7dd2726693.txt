History:	18 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O EPILEPSY LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE.
PMHX SIG FOR PROLONGED FEBRILE SZ AT AGE 13 MONTHS.
Medications:	LAMICTAL, ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving.  HR is 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region, which is
consistent with the know surgery.
