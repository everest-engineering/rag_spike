CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed man with a history of seizures, blindness, depression, and hypertension who presents with a history of seizures described as generalized tonic/clonic seizures with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Clonidine, Lisinopril.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous eye movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz at times with normal frontocentral beta seen.  Please note that during the recording there is continuous eye movement artifact which may be due to the patient's blindness.  The EEG appears to become drowsy but not clearly asleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
