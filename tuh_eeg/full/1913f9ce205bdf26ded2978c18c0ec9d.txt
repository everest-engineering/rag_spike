CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old female with a history of seizures since age 25, seizure-free for 8 years, now returned for the past 7 years with nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide and Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is minimal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
