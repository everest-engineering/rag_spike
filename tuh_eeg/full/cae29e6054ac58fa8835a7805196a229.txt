CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman with a stroke, diabetes, nonambulatory status, small vessel ischemic disease Left MCA and CVA seizures in 2010.  Follow up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed on a stretcher for this nonverbal adult, using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was able to nod yes to questions.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates moderate background slowing with primarily a theta frequency pattern and at times generous beta.  As the patient transitions off to sleep, there are bursts of frontal delta which are a little higher amplitude on the left and there is a small amount of shifting delta.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Features of drowsiness including increase in background slowing.  Heart rate irregular at 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Relatively marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this awake adult who can communicate, this degree of background slowing is more compatible with a chronic encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were observed. In contrast to 2010 EEG, this is now a pattern of generalized, not focal slowing. No sharp waves were seen this time
