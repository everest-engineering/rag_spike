History:	45 YO MALE WITH A HX OF HIV, HEP C, PRIOR HEROIN ABUSE. P/W ? SEIZURE.
PT WAS WALKING ACROSS THE STREET HAD SUDDEN BLURRY VISION AND
REMEMBERS WAKING UP IN HOSPITAL POST ICTAL CONFUSION. CT HEAD -
NO ACUTE ABNORMALITY.
Medications:	METHADONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Some fronto central beta is seen.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75
uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
