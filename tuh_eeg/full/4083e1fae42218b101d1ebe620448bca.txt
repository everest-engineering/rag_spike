History:	40 YO MALE P/W AMS AND RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS STARTING YESTERDAY,
AND NOT FOLLOWING COMMANDS.  PMHX: CVA, GERD, SZ, HTN, L MCA, DM,
ASTHMA
NOW PT IS APHASIC WITH RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS
Medications:	Insulin, Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 96
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, Midtemporal maximal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal
in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this
region, likely structural in origin.In addition there is moderate to severe
