INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Features of stage I sleep include abundant posts with occasional vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as some slowing. Photic stimulation does produce a vigorous driving response.
HR: 	90 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
