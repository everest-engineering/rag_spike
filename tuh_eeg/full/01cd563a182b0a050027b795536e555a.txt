History:	77 YR OLD MALE WITH 2 WITNESSED SZ. OVERNIGHT AND PEA ARREST.
PMHX.R LUNG TRANSPLANT 10-14 ,PULMONARY FIBROSIS,CAD,CHF,CKD,
Medications:	NOREPINEPHRINE, FLUCONAZOLE, DOPAMINE.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
State changes can can be seen and some normal sleep architecture is noted including vertex
The right temporal region is attenuated compared to the left continuously.  There are some very low
amplitude sharp transients seen over the left temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 54 with some PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, mild, right temporal
Sharp transients, rare, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of right temporal attenuation. This finding is indicative of a
structural cortical lesion in that region or alternatively a fluid collection over that region. The sharp
transients are of unclear significance. Lastly, there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
