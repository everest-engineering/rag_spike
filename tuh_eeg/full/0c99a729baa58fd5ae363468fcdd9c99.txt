History:	38 year old woman with a history of MS, now presents with a single convulsion that
occurred ~ 2 weeks ago.
Medications:	Avonex, Neurontin, Elavil
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Nearly continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the bitemporal regions
(left>>right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Brief TIRDA (temporal intermittent
rhythmic delta activity) is noted over the left.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), left
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Sharp transients, one, right temporal
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG due to nearly continuous mild-to-moderate focal
bitemporal slowing (left>right) and brief bursts of left TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta
activity). Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Left
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) indicates a potential epileptogenic zone over
the left temporal region.  The presence of a single right temporal sharp wave is of uncertain clinical
