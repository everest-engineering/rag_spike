History:	81 YO FEMALE WITH  EPISODE OF STARING SPELL, STOPPED RESPONDING.
LASTED 2 MIN.   ,  S/P CEREBRAL ANEURYSM COILING 3/14.  PMHX: HTN, CKD,
RETINOPATHY.
Medications:	CIPRO, METOPROLOL, LASIX, NORVASC, PRAVASTATIN, LISINOPRIL, HEPARIN,
TRAZODONE, AMLODIPINE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  There is excess diffuse 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  As drowsiness progresses,
symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the left temporal region (maximum at T3) during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  2) occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out
a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
