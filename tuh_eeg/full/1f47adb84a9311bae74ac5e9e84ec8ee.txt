CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old male who was transferred from another hospital after 4 mg of Ativan and a propofol drip.  The patient is described as having an abnormal CT with atrophy on the left, but is now not moving the left side very well, intubated, and poorly responsive.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is not particularly interactive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The left hemisphere initially is written 8 Hz activity.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more significant slowing.  Intermittent, broadly contoured, sharp waves are picked up out of the right hemisphere maximum at T2, but with a broad field of spread, including T4 and C4. Stimulation of the patient clearly results in an alerting response with an increase in faster frequency activity, particularly on the left.  Although the patient does not follow commands, when asked to do commands, the EEG is somewhat reactive.  As the recording continues, there are fewer sharp waves noted on the right.  The right sided focal slowing is more prominent when the patient is unstimulated.

HR:    120 bpm

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Disruption or attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this patient who appears unresponsive, this EEG is reactive.  The sharp waves and the focal slowing suggest a structural process on the right.
