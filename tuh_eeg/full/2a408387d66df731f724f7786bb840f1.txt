REASON FOR STUDY:  Transient left-sided weakness and seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old man with history of fungal sinusitis, status post drainage surgery with history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and left-sided weakness and 2 generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, Protonix, aspirin, and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during limited wakefulness and mainly in sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals limited wakefulness during which a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz can be seen at best and appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is diffuse beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded mainly in sleep stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Heart rate 84.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F8/T3 and at times with a large field that can be seen over F3 and sometimes even FP2 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  One of these focal slowings had a very sharply contoured transient, but not clearly epileptiform.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left frontotemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontotemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
