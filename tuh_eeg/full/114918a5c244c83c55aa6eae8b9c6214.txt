Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence
of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 60  The record is obscured by excessive EMG and myogenic artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
