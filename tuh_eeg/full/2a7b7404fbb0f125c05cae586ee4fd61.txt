CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old right-handed woman, who experienced multiple seizures in the field, presented with left-sided weakness, long history of epilepsy after gunshot wound, gastric bypass, gamma therapy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamictal, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  DIGITAL:  A routine digital video EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  During this EEG, the patient had a coughing spell.  The patient also had a spell just prior to the EEG resembled a seizure, and there was a long pause during the recording when the EEG was turned off while the patient was coughing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta and a small amount of theta.  Extraocular movements are asymmetric in this record.
Features of sleep include:
Photic stimulation elicits:
Hyperventilation elicits:
Notable in this record are:
Heart rate:  90 BPM
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a technically suboptimal record, but no epileptiform features were noted.  The asymmetric eye movements should be correlated with cranial imaging for this individual with prior traumatic brain injury.
