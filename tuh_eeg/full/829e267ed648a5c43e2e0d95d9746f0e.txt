CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed female with history of asthma and no family history of seizures or head trauma who presents with new onset seizures on 8/2011, during sleep with generalized tonic clonic shaking an a second episode on 9/16/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol

REASON FOR STUDY: Seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrode and EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep stage 1, stage 2 were recorded. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a well formed posterior dominant
rhythm at 9Hz with 2260 microvolts amplitude and normal frontocentral beta. Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and stage 2. Aggravated procedures with photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges and hyperventilation accentuated so e focal slowing, please see below in abnormal discharges.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow was seen at T3 at 2-4 Hz at times in runs of 2. not clearly monomorphic. These were accentuated by hyperventilation.
SEIZURES: None.
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveal evidence of left mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards o etiology. No or epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note that our routine EEG exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Prolonged recording and capturing deeper stages of sleep may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
