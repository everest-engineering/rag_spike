CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with cerebral aneurysm which was previously coiled. The patient was admitted November 8 for inability to move the right side and then December 3 for hypotension. Now with intermittent episodes of unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is somewhat slow.  In addition, there is an apparent breach rhythm present, but not prominent on the right with higher amplitude activity on that side.  Intermittent focal slowing is noted on the right with some sharp wave contours, delta in the right central temporal region.  Alerting seems to ameliorate this.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.  Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild, generalized background slowing.
Somewhat subtle right central temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality on the right.  In comparison to a previous study on November 9, the focal slowing and the background slowing are markedly improved.  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted and no seizures were recorded.
