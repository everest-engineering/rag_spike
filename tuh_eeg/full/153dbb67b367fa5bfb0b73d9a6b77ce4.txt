CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old status post motorcycle accident intubated,
comatose, recent use of pentobarbital coma, none x 4 hours.
MEDICATIONS: None listed in chart
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10:-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The ECS montage is employed.
This is a 5-hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates ICU artifact.
The overall pattern is depressed. The data can be re-reviewed with the ECS montage.
No definitive cerebral activity is identified. Occasional artifacts are noted, particularly in
the left occipital region. These are best identified with the use of the average reference
montage at which point the artifacts are more clearly differentiated from the suppressed
background.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Absence of cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To place this in the appropriate clinical context is
imperative to know the dates and times of this patient's sedative hypnotic medications.
An attempt was made to contact the neurosurgical attending at 6:33 pm regarding these
results.
