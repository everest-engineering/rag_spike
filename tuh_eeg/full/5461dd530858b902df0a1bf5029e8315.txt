INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE NOTE
Routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system including EKG electrodes awake and stage I,

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
Well formed posterior dominant rhythm of 9Hz with 20-75 microvolts amplitude was seen symmetrically reactive to eye open
and eye closing with a small amount of fronto-central 15-25 Hz and 10-15 microvolts beta rhythm. Sleep was characterized
by stage I and Stage II sleep. Photic stimulation was performed with no abnormal activity and hyperventilation was performed
with normal high generalized high amplitude delta seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
