CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old gentleman with epilepsy, osteopenia, cataracts, osteoarthritis. Nursing home resident with cognitive impairment.
MEDICATIONS: Bactrim, Phenobarbital, Avodart, Uroxatral, Protonix,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This dysmorphic male is sitting up in a wheelchair. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record begins with the patient in a drowsy state with generous beta and theta. The prominent features in the record include well-defined right mid to anterior temporal sharp waves at T2 and F8, but sometimes F8 or T4. They have a generous field of spread in an after-going slow rate. Nearly every 10 second section of the EEG includes at least 1 sharp wave. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and a loss of head control. Photic stimulation does not seem to activate the record but it does seem to reduce the epileptiform activity.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frequent right temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes.
2. Right mid temporal focal slowing with a generous field of spread.
3. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy as well as a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
