DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record demonstrates wakefulness alpha rhythm at 9.5 to 10 Hz, 16 microvolts.  Mu rhythm was seen.  Drowsiness was characterized with an increase of anterior spread of alpha activity.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
