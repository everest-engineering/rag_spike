CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old man with mental retardation, seizures since birth, and his last seizure four years ago consistent with staring spell and foaming at the mouth, mostly at night.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EEG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness only.  Activating procedures could not be performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient could not stop moving and there was marked movement and electrode interference artifact due to the movement throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There appears to be a diffuse slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm.  At times there is some frontocentral beta that can be seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the recording is low quality due to the movement as described before and appears to be disorganized and attenuated diffusely.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at amplitudes of 20-30 microvolts and diffuse attenuation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This limited EEG reveals generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.  Please note again that this is a limited EEG.  If further or repeated EEG is needed, it would be helpful to use a sedative prior to the testing.
