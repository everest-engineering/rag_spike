58 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, PMHX SIG FOR DRUG ABUSE, UNCONTROLLED DM. SEEN AT OSH 1 DAY PTA FOR SUGAR, PT MENTAL STATUS NORMAL. ? ONSET OF SZ WITH PRIOR C/C OF HA
No AEDs
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by right hemisphere attenuation and left hemisphere theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies . During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity and attenuation is present in the right hemisphere region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 60 with some PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic , continuous, marked, right hemispheric Attenuation, continuous, right hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL  EEG because of  continuous focal slowing and attenuation in the right hemisphere.   This finding is indicative of a structural lesion involving cortex. In addition there is moderate diffuse  background slowing and absent alpha rhythm, findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific
