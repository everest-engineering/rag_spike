CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 85-year-old man who presents with left facial twitching and left-sided shaking.  In the emergency room he was observed to have a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, lorazepam, aspirin.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient during maximal wakefulness.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude mixture of theta and delta.  During the period of quiescence, intermittent background discontinuities lasting from 1 to 5 seconds are captured.  Sleep spindle like wave forms are captured, as well.  Additional polymorphic high amplitude theta and delta are captured over the left hemisphere, primarily over the left central region.  No clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Frequent periods of background discontinuity.
Focal slowing over the left hemisphere, primarily over the left central region.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 29-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, background discontinuity, and focal left hemispheric slowing, most notably over the left central region.  Diffuse slowing and background discontinuity indicate moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology and this case could partially be related to the medication effect.  Focal slowing over the left hemisphere is
suggestive of an underlying cerebral dysfunction that could be structural in etiology.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.
