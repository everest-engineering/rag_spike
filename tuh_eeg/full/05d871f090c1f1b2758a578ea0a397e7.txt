CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed female with history of generalized tonic clonic seizures and headaches. The patient was a victim of assault/trauma.

MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Metaxalone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG shows a 12 Hz alpha rhythm. There is prominent eye movement artifact. During hyperventilation, there is increased amplitude and theta waves following hyperventilation. The patient appears to be very sleepy. During sleep, we visualized trains of POSTS and vertex waves.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The prominent bursts of stage 2 sleep can be due to sleep deprivation or a sleep disturbance.
