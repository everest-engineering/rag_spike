History:	64 YO MALE PRESENTED TO ED AFTER SUSTAINING A FALL FROM STANDING
POSITION. WIFE CLAIMS PT LOSES BALANCE OFTEN. PT HAS ETOH ABUSE
PMHX: HTN, SZ, CHRONIC ETOH ABUSE
Medications:	COLACE AND FOLIC ACID, LABETALOL, LAMICTAL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Posterior dominant rhythm was at best 8Hz..  Background activity was mainly characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
