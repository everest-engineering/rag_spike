CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old right handed male with 2 tonic clonic seizures for which the patient is amnestic. They began 2 months ago. No alcohol or substance abuse, but on chronic Vicodin for herniated L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk.
MEDICATIONS:  Vicodin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is very well organized with a 10 hertz alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing some beta and theta. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
