History:	52 year old man with a history of HIV/AIDS now presents with recurrent syncopal
Medications:	Lovenox, Asa, Vit B & C, Acyclovir
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A regular heart rate is noted on a
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL portable 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and briefly asleep. The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
