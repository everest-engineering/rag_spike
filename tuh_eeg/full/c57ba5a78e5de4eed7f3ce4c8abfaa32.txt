History:	53 year old man with a history of seizures that occur about once per month, mostly
during sleep.  Patient has a VNS and the battery is scheduled to be replaced in
August, 2014.
Medications:	Keppra, Neurontin, Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low-voltage 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is observed.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Repetitive low amplitude fast frequency artifact lasting ~ 30 seconds is noted throughout the
recording, including EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, other, VNS
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Intermittent VNS artifact is seen throughout the recording.
