CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old left handed woman with a family history of epilepsy. Occipital headache for 3 days. The patient had an altercation with her boyfriend and abrupt loss of consciousness. She was taken to the emergency room where the headache was alleviated with Tylenol, but remains very drowsy. The patient denies use of sedative medication.
MEDICATIONS: None reported.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.  The patient is extremely drowsy and has difficulty maintaining an awake state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes low to medium amplitude pattern with a 12 hertz alpha rhythm and generous beta activity. The patient arouses briefly and then drifts off to sleep with features of stage I and stage II  sleep including vertex waves and POSTS.
HR:	78 bpm with frequent PVC's
IMPRESSION: This EEG is notable for:
1.	Prominent beta.
2.	Frequent PVCs.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess beta may be due to medications or anxiety or even represent normal variant. A clinical evaluation may be appropriate for the excess of  sleepiness as well as the beta activity. No epileptiform features are identified. Additional evaluation for the irregular heart rate may be appropriate for this woman with syncope.
