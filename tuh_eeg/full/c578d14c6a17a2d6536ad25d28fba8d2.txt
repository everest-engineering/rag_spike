Medications:	Risperdal, Keppra, Synthroid, Coumadin, ASA, Pravastatin, Protonix, ISS, Vitamins
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a poorly-formed, fragmented posterior dominant rhythm of
8 Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess 6-7 Hz theta activity with diffuse
distribution is noted during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Occasional
focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.
