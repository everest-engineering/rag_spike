EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening for a brief period of time during this recording.  Symmetric 5-15uV,
18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG capturing the patient mostly during asleep with brief periods of
wakefulness. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
