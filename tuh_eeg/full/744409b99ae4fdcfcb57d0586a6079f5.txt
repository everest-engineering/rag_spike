CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 75-year-old male with frequent headaches and 2 confusional spells.  In addition, he is having difficulty with his hearing and difficulty with auditory processing.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin, topiramate, Zocor, Seroquel, Cymbalta.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  The alpha activity is relatively high amplitude, reaching 90 microvolts.  Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record producing a small amount of rhythmic slowing.  Features of drowsiness include occasional bursts of shifting slowing, particularly in the posterior temporal regions.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to
intermittent, more posteriorly predominant slowing with some posteriorly predominant delta early drowsiness.
CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:  The high amplitude alpha is a normal finding.  The posteriorly predominant slowing is a nonspecific finding. It may be due to underlying cerebrovascular disease.  No epileptiform features were identified.  There were no specific hallmarks of a neurological or a psychiatric syndrome.
