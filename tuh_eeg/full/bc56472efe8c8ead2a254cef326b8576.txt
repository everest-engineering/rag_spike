History:	64 year old man who presents with a breakthrough seizure.  Patient has a history of
a stroke and is non-compliant with his medications.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  During
maximal arousal, the background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta
activity with underriding fast activity without clear PDR or AP gradient.  There is paucity of fast
frequencies over the right.  Stage changes are clearly observed with K-complex-like waveform
Intermittent independent bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves are noted.  Maximal scalp
negativity occurs over F7/T1/T3 leads and F8/T2/T4 leads.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Patient is agitated early in the
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric
Attenuation, continuous, mild, right hemispheric
Sharp waves, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior, independent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 23-minute EEG due to (1) moderate diffuse
slowing; (2) continuous focal right hemispheric slowing and attenuation and (3) independent
intermittent bilateral anterior temporal epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing
is indicative of a focal structural lesion in over the right.  Additionally, this could be a post-ictal
phenomenon.  There are two independent epileptogenic foci emanating from the anterior
