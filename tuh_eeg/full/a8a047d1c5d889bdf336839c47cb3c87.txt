History:	21year old woman with a history of absence seizures
Medications:	Zarontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is observed  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, the alpha rhythm attenuates
and becomes intermittent, and prominent POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are
observed.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage bursts of delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm during sleep.
Summary of Findings:
POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1- hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on
a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
heart rate <60 bpm during sleep.
