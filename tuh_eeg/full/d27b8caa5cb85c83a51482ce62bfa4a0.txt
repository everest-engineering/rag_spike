CLINICAL HISTORY:   45 year old right handed man presenting with a history of completion of dialysis with episode of generalized seizure activity. Duration of seizure was not noted. The patient had some confusion and agitation after the event. Past medical history significant for end stage renal disease, hypertension, polycystic kidney disease and hypothyroidism. No prior history of seizures was reported.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Oxycodone, Lorazepam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Wakefulness and sleep was reported.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly disorganized pattern with posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. There is excess theta and shifting slowing beta rhythm at the background. Also, there is moderate amount of frontocentral beta activity. Sleep is characterized as stage I and II with ill defined K complex and sleep spindles and vertex waves in the central region. Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Mild disorganized alpha rhythm in the background.
Excess beta waves on the posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG shows mild disorganized pattern on the background with a prominent beta frequency that may indicate some metabolic abnormality or medications. No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note that normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
