CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old male with an ATV accident in October, central hematoma, cranioplasty with first generalized seizure in March 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient has a craniotomy defect on the left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates an asymmetry. From the right hemisphere, the EEG is relatively well organized with 10 Hz alpha rhythm. Mu was identified bilaterally. The left hemisphere demonstrates a breech rhythm. In addition, there is theta in the left hemisphere particularly frontocentral and temporal regions. The activity is primarily T3 and C3 as the patient becomes drowsy. Photic stimulation elicits some bilateral driving response. Hyperventilation accentuates the focal theta on the left.
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
Left central temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or spikes were seen. If additional information is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
