REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old man with a history of GERD, CAD, head trauma and change in mental status, described as he did not feel right and then found on a chair staring and shaking with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation which caused mid temporal focal slowing which I will describe better in the abnormal discharges.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slowing seen independently over T3 and T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz throughout the recording.  This was accentuated by hyperventilation.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent bilateral mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral independent bilateral focal cerebral dysfunction in the anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
