CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old female with history of sarcoidosis, status post lung transplant, now with head movements, rule out seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Benzo's.

REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video long term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temple and single lead EKG electrodes.  Patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is much movement artifact throughout the recording as well as ventilator artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Study shows slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central or beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with amplitude of 20-50 micro volts were seen continuously throughout the recording.
2. Anterior predominant symmetric triphasic waves occurring at 1-2 Hz, continuously throughout the recording were seen.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slow waves and triphasics.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific as regards to etiology.  However, the presence of triphasics suggested that encephalopathy is likely due at least in part to a metabolic derangement.  No seizures were seen.
