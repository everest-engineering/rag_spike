CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed female with intermittent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Classification of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term EEG was performed for 24-hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient's EEG was reviewed using continued spike detection software, as well as seizure detection software, as well as patient alert and nurses noted events.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is day 1 of a long term monitoring.  The background is consistent with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 intermittently at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
NOTE:  There is again a marked amount of rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness seen bitemporally.
SEIZURES:  None.
EVENTS:  The patient had 4 push button events, none of which were epileptic, some of them were testing of the machine.
LONG TERM MONITORING – 12-61 – 05/15/2012
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software, as well as seizure detection software, patient reported events, as well as patient's nurses notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES  None.
Episodes or patient noted events:  None during day 2 of recording.
IMPRESSION:  Dictated at the end of the session as this is the end of day 2 recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Dictated at the end of the session as this is the end of day 2 recording.
