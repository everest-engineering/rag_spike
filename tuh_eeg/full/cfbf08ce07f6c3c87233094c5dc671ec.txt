CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with refractory seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Vimpat, Thiamine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. During the EEG monitor, the patient is started on Vimpat and the Keppra dose is increased. He is initially somnolent and then increasingly alert, but not particularly interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG was recorded from the 16th through the 18th, but valid data is really only present from the 16th through the 17th. The background is markedly slow. In contrast to previous sections of the records, it is more of a slow pattern with less of the rhythmic left temporal intermittent rhythmic delta. Following the administration of the Vimpat the epileptiform activity seems to be fading. The EEG can be reformatted to try and eliminate the bad electrodes. No clinical seizures were noted.
HR:    110 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Marked reduction in epileptiform activity.
Markedly slow background
CLINICAL CORRELATION:    Seizures decreased after adjustment in AED Therapy.
