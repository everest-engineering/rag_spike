CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male with first ever seizure 3 weeks ago, characterized by left leg twitching, left leg weakness and numbness.  Found to have right frontal parenchymal contusion and right subdural hematoma in November 2002.  Admitted on the 21st for numbness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is prominent, frontal central beta.  In wakefulness an a bit more prominently in drowsiness, there is focal slowing from the right frontal central and central temporal regions.  This is primarily characterized by slower delta, but with some disruption in faster frequency activity.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, and accentuates the right frontal central focal slowing.  Features of drowsiness included increase in beta.  The intermittent right frontal central focal slowing persists.
Photic stimulation elicited harmonic and super harmonic driving.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing from the right frontal central region with occasional disruption of frequency activity in that area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a structural or functional process in the right frontal central region.  No epileptiform features were identified.  As this patient recovers from the head injury, a follow-up study may be of value.
