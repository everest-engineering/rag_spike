HISTORY: 46 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, last seizure 4
months ago and a history of brain abscess and intermittent dizzy spells, epilepsy and
frontal lobe abscess in 1994.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm of 40
microvolts. There is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more delta in the left frontal region
and as the patient becomes drowsy, there is beta accentuation in the left frontal region.
Hyperventilation produces some rhythmic bilateral slowing. Photic stimulation elicits
scant bilateral driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle left frontal delta.
2. Frontal beta accentuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The delta described above has been reported in previous
studies. The beta asymmetry can be seen following previous craniotomy or treatment to
the abscess as described above.
