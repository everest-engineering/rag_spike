History:	35 YO MALE S/P HYPOGLYCEMIA AND CODE. PMH: HTN, ASTHMA , DM
Medications:	VERSED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There
is an intermixed intermittent frontal beta.  At times with arousal the diffuse slowing appears more
rhythmic.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is focal attenuation of beta activity and faster frequencies over
the right temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 150
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, associated attenuation
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse, With stimulation it at times appears to be more
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slow and attenuation of the right
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal cortical lesion in this region or alternatively
there could be a collection of fluid overlying that region. In addition there is  diffuse background
slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
