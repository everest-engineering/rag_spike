History:	40 YR MALE S/P ACOUSTIC NEUROMA RESEC..  POD 8. ON 6/8. PT FELL CT.
RIGHT FRONTAL CONTUSION..  PT DENIES MEMORY OF EVENT.  SKULL
DEFECT LEFT TRANLABRYNTHI EXCISION .  NO PMHX OF SZ BUT HAD
EPISODE 2006 LOC.
Medications:	Keppra, oxycodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess diffuse 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent independent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region
(maximum at T6) and left frontocentral region (F3/C3) during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 75.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontal, F3/C3
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  2)
independent intermittent focal slowing in the right temporal and left frontocentral regions.  These
findings are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
