CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old left handed male with epilepsy since 1970, nocturnal
seizures, currently seizure free for 15 years.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Diltiazem, Enalapril, HCTZ, Ranitidine, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a mild degree of
disorganization for age noted in this record. There is also a very mild asymmetry in the
frequency of the alpha rhythm, with the alpha rhythm on the left, sometimes a little
slower than the right. Features of drowsiness includes hypersynchronous rhythmic
slowing. Occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity are noted in the transition
to sleep. Photic stimulation does not significant activate the record.
60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild, shifting asymmetries.
2. An alpha rhythm, which is sometimes slower on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is
suggested.
