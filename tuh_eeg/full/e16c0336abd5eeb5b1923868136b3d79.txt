CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old man with sudden onset slurred speech, foaming at the mouth with unresponsiveness.  He was confused for 30 minutes after the event.
Past Medical History:  Hypertension, diabetes, old right MCA, CVA with left-sided weakness, ACOM aneurysm clipping.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, insulin, Protonix, aspirin, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, he has background rhythm of about 8.3 Hz in the bilateral occipital regions, which was reactive to eye opening.  There is right frontocentral slowing with disruption of faster frequencies on the right side.  There are occasional simple sharp waves in the right temporal region.  Drowsiness was characterized by generalized slowing.  Asymmetric vertex waves were noted.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Photic stimulation elicited driving response at intermediate frequencies.
There was a breach rhythm noted.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is abnormal due to the presence of
Right focal slowing.
Right temporal sharp waves.
Breach rhythm, asymmetric vertex waves.
Clinical Correlation:  This EEG is suggestive of epileptogenic structural abnormality in the right hemisphere, which is consistent with the history of old stroke and aneurysm clipping.
