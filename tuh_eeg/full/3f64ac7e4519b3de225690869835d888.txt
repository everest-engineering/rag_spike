CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed gentleman with a history of head trauma, memory impairment, and headache 2 to 4 times per week.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record. The patient was talking through hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. There is rhythmic theta activity identified in the left hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal region. There is also a breach rhythm identified with accentuation of the beta activity in the left frontocentral region. A single C3 sharp was identified. Hyperventilation was performed with limited effort and does seem to accentuate the rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving.

HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing in the left frontocentral/frontotemporal region.
2. Rare left central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were seen in the previous EEG in 2008.
