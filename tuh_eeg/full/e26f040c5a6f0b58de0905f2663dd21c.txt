CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old woman who is status post cardiac arrest on 5/26/2010. Evaluate for anoxic encephalopathy. History of seizures and renal failure as well as persistent coma.
MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Phenytoin, Cyclosporine, Prednisone, Heparin, Heparin, Valproate, Phenytoin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and comatose. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is very low voltage. There is some artifact noted in the record but there is scant cerebral activity in this otherwise discontinuous record. The overall appearance is more of a suppressed pattern than a pattern with cerebral activity. The ECS montage is employed and, still, there appears to be some activity seen intermittently in the record which could not be considered artifact. In addition, using slow paper speed, the activity is asynchronous in the 2 hemispheres.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
I. Suppressed and, at times, discontinuous or asynchronous pattern but one with some persistent cerebral activity particularly of delta frequency.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. The prior study also demonstrated a markedly abnormal pattern. Additional evaluation using other techniques may be helpful but these findings suggest a worrisome prognosis.
