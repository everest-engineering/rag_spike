CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old male status post left MCA stroke, history of seizures, admitted with fever, elevated CRP, and clonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Inpatient medicines; Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra, Coumadin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  The patient was examined throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a relatively somnolent individual.  He does alert to tactile stimulation with eye opening and will look above.
The overall background is relatively low voltage with generous beta.  With eye opening, there is at times an alpha frequency pattern, although the patient does not sustain alertness.
Tactile stimulation produces clonus as can be seen at 8:26 p.m. on the September 10, 2014 and at 8:45 a.m. on the September 11, 2014.  Tactile stimulation also produces eye opening and an increase in alpha frequency activity in the background.
Interictal Epileptiform Activity:  None.
Electrographic Seizures: None.
Heart rate 110 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video-EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
A generalized slow pattern with generous beta.
Relatively subtle superimposed focal slowing in the left hemisphere.
Paucity of epileptiform activity.
Clinical events with clonus which do not have an EEG signature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, but one that impacts the left hemisphere most significantly.
