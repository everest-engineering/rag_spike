History:	70 year man admitted with progressive change in mental status for the last 5 days
Medications:	aspirin, lisinopril, protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches maximally 9 Hz alpha activity.  The AP gradient is weak.
The background consists of excessive polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Periods of quiescence
are captured but no normal sleep architecture is seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 20-minute EEG because of mild-to-moderate diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
