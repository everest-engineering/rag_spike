CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right-handed woman with a history of epilepsy with myoclonic, tonic clonic, and absence seizures. Recent recurrence of nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Cymbalta, Clorazepate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a modest amount of 13 Hz beta activity. Posterior slow waves of youth are observed as a Mu rhythm, although testing is not performed to confirm this. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
