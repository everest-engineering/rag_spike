CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old right-handed male, who was hit in the head with a softball and had an episode of loss of consciousness with nausea, vomiting, drunk feeling, and hypersomnolence.  Past history of hepatitis C.  After head trauma, the patient blacked out on way to the bathroom.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, meloxicam, and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Briefer stages of sleep were not achieved.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate is 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
