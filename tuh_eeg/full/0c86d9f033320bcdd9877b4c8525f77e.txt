History:	68 year old man with intermittent episodes of expressive aphasia over the last
several weeks.  Patient was unaware of these events.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region,
increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash frequencies.  HR 78
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior, mild-to-moderate
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in
the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges are
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
