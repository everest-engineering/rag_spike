REASON FOR STUDY: Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded while Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS: None mentioned.
HISTORY: A 29-year-old woman with change in mental status and possible sepsis.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: There were some electrodes on the left that had some high impedances due to difficulty with the patient.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely low-voltage background that is disorganized. I have no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta. There is no abnormal sleep architecture. No activation procedures are performed.
The overall background consists of 1-4 Hz low voltage delta seen continuously throughout the recording. The patient was stimulated and there is no reactivity or change in the EEG.
Seizures: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to marked generalized flowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific In regards to etiology, No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
