LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 46-year-old woman with left-sided Bell palsy that started approximately 3 months ago.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Sumatriptan, metioprim, indomethacin, prednisone, valacyclovir.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening. There is anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient  with faster frequencies at lower amplitude anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K complexes and bilateral POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation resolves at symmetrical simple driving at middle range flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 21-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
