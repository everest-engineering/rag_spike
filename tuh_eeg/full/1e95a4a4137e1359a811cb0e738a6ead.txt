CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male with epilepsy post-stroke, tonic clonic seizures for the last four years, last seizure was one month ago. History of hypertension, epilepsy post-stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Keppra, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is occasional shifting temporal theta, more prominent on the left than the right. Discrete anterior temporal sharp waves are observed with rare (2) right centrotemporal sharp waves and a very subtle accentuation of beta activity in the right centrotemporal region, seen in sleep. Hyperventilation accentuates the focal features from the left temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves seen primarily on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been described in previous EEGs and support a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. Of note, the epileptiform activity on the right has been noted in this individual with many studies, not all have identified epileptiform activity as is often the case in complex partial epilepsy.
