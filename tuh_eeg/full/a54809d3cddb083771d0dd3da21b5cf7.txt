History:	39 year old man who a history of ICH and craniotomy, now has facial twitching.
Medications:	Keppra, Oxycodone, morphine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
Patient moves throughout nearly the entirety of the recording.  Voltages are diffusely very low.
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left consists of low amplitude 8-8.5 Hz activity posteriorly with the expected AP
gradient and mild excess of polymorphic theta activity.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the
right is not as well formed as over the left.  PDR on the right reaches 8 Hz theta activity.
Additionally, there is no AP gradient over the right and continuous polymorphic slow delta activity
is noted over the  right anterior quadrant.  Patient very briefly comes drowsy by the end of the
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right anterior, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right hemispheric
Artifact, movement, frequent
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy portable 24 minute EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing and
(2) continuous focal right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right anterior
quadrant. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  There is focal structural cerebral abnormality over the right hemisphere, most notably
