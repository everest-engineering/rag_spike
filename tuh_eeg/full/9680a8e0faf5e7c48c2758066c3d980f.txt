CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old right handed male, seizure free for many years, with recent increase in tonic clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record in this relatively drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in a drowsy adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features identified in this record. This is similar to previous studies. Additional evaluation for his tachycardia is suggested.
