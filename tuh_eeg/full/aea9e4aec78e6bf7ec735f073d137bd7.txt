CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old woman, admitted on the 30th with alcohol withdrawal seizures and uncontrolled diabetes.  She presented with a left facial droop and then had an alcohol withdrawal seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on Lovenox and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is 7.5 Hz and reactive.  The overall background is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There are bursts of shifting slowing which are occasionally rhythmic in the left temporal region.  Features of drowsiness include increasing background slowing.  In addition, there are occasional bursts of rhythmic slowing or shifting slowing wave forms in wakefulness.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Bursts of rhythmic slowing from the left temporal region.
Intermittent, bilateral rhythmic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, which may be toxic, metabolic, or postictal.  The rhythmic slowing from the left raises the possibility of a focal mechanism for this patient's seizures.  No sharp waves or spikes were identified.  The EEG findings are nonspecific and support a toxic metabolic etiology or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The rhythmic slowing on the left raises the possibility of a focal mechanism for seizures, although no sharp waves or spikes were seen.
