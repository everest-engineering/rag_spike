CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old woman with renal failure, DVT, stroke, thyroid disease, admitted to the hospital with cough, shortness of breath, and then an episode of confusion and agitation on October 8, 2012.

MEDICATIONS:  Nephrocaps, azithromycin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically very challenging EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a high amplitude, chaotic pattern. There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in a background intermittently disrupted by high amplitude frontal delta and theta.

Stimulation of the patient produces a bit of faster frequency activity.  Tactile and cognitive testing of the patient produces a reduction in the FIRDA.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic high amplitude frontal delta.

Heart rate:  78 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Prominent high amplitude FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  compatible with a metabolic encephalopathy, no sharp waves, no spikes.
