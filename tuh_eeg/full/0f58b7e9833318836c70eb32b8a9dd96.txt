CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old left handed woman with recurrent blackout spells
after stress. She had a tongue biting experience with one of the spells on May 24.
Loss of consciousness for 1 to 2 minutes. Bipolar disorder.
MEDICATIONS: Tramadol, Remeron, Klonopin, Flexeril, Albuterol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
1 0.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving
response.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no focal nor epileptiform features noted in this
record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an
important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is
suggested.
