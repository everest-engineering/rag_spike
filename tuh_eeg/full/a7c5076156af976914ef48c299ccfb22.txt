CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed woman with a history of congenital hydrocephalus, multiple shunts, occasional headaches, childhood epilepsy seizure-free for 6 to 7 years. Past EEGs with complex epileptiform activity from either hemisphere.
MEDICATIONS: Neurontin, Actonel, Carbamazepine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a skull defect in the right occipital region with an increase in amplitude of activity in that region. In addition, there is an alpha rhythm of 7.5 to 8.3 Hz. Occasional bursts of generalized delta are noted. Hyperventilation produces an increase in generalized delta as well as focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant and sharp waves which are high amplitude with a generous field of spread maximum at F8T4. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does elicit a subtle driving response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right posterior focal slowing.
2. Right central sharp waves.
3. Background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, epileptiform activity is less prominent. In fact, in this study, there are only sharp waves on the right.
