History:	26 year old woman with a history of events concerning for seizures.
Medications:	ABILIFY, DEPAKOTE, AMBIEN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation is attempted but aborted at 1 Hz flash
rate since patient developed an event.  The event lasts <1 minute.  It is characterized by patient
starting to moan and tear up soon after the photic stimulation is started.  Patient is able to follow
simple commands, respond to questions appropriately and recall the code word.  There is  no
associated ictal correlate.  There is frequent eye flutter artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Event, one, non-epileptic
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, eye movement
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake-only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. A single event of moaning and crying that starts at the onset of photic
stimulation has no abnormal ictal correlate.
