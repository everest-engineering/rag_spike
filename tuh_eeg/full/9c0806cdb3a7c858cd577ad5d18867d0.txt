CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old woman, who had a single tonic-clonic seizure at 3 a.m. on November 21st.  Patient states that she had been very sleep deprived.  She was able to say that she was going to have a seizure and laid herself on the floor.  She was postictal and then afterwards got up and put herself in the wheelchair.  Past history of other sleep-deprived seizures.
MEDICATIONS: No AED's
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable awake EEG for a patient who was very tense.  Minimal drowsiness was obtained.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, and a fair amount of temporalis muscle artifact.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited minimal driving.
Heart rate 75 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and limited drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were seen.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  Normal EEG, does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
