History:	52 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Last reported seizure occurred ~ 5-6
months ago.
Medications:	Zonisamide, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During  drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Subtle paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the left anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild temporal, anterior, subtle
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 1-hour EEG due to subtle mild continuous focal slowing
over the left anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
