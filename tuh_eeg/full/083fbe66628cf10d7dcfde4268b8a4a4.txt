CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old woman with refractory focal seizures. Please follow up.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Keppra, Depakote, Amiodarone, ASA, Zocor.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as agitated, but not having seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat poorly organized. There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but overall there is excess theta, more so from the left than the right. There is a left occipital sharp wave. The patient is noted to have rapid, purposeful movements of the left hand in wakefulness. It is not possible to see the right side of the body during those sections of the record with right high amplitude left occipital sharp waves, including 11:28:58. There are reports from the technologists in describing the patient as agitated, not following commands. The patient's right side of the body is under the covers during the EEG and it is not possible to see if there is any twitching or trembling with left occipital sharp waves. The left occipital sharp waves are well defined in both referential and bipolar montages. At times they are periodic in nature.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent, at times periodic, left occipital sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A careful examination of this patient during the EEG is advised as the left occipital sharp waves are more prominent than in previous studies. If there is any questions, the patient's right arm and leg should be exposed during the next EEG.
