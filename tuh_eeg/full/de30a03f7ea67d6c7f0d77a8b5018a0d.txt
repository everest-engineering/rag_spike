CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old gentleman with episodes of losing control of legs and hand shaking.  The last event was last month when he lost control of his legs and stumbled about.  History of CABG.  These events occur in the morning and can last hours.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, Klonopin, lisinopril, many others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed because of the cardiac history, but photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In drowsiness, there is slowing of the alpha rhythm with an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

Heart rate 60 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for an adult of this age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and if indicated a repeat tracing capturing one of his spells may be of value.
