CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old woman with bilateral frontal craniotomy, brain mass,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, shingles, total knee replacement, evaluate for encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10Â·20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient appears to be
somewhat somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is
disorganized. There is some 8 Hertz activity and some slower delta activity as well as
some beta frequency activity. There are shifting asymmetries with left frontal sharply
contoured delta and some left frontal sharp waves. There seems to be a breech rhythm
with intermittent beta accentuation at F3. In addition, there are other sections with more
rhythmic right frontal delta. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response at
intermediate flash frequencies.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Somewhat slow and disorganized pattern.
2. Shifting focal features from the frontal region.
3. Left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. No
seizures are recorded. This study supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
