LENGTH OF RECORDING:  24 minutes
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 62-year-old man with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, PA code on 02/20/2012, hypertension, stroke, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, COPD, now presents with chief complaint of twitching.  Of note, the patient has not received dialysis for about 3 days.  During most recent dialysis he had generalized tonic clonic convulsion characterized by generalized shaking and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zofran, heparin, metoprolol, thiamine.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed in the laboratory.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode, and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and predominant delta activity.  This delta activity is frequently semi-rhythmic and most pronounced over bilateral parasagittal regions.  No abnormal sleep architecture is captured.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the left temporal region.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Step photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Continuous focal left temporal slowing.
No clear electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal awake only 24-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and focal left temporal slowing.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologic nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, suspected toxic metabolic in etiology in this patient.  Focal left temporal slowing is indicative of underlying focal cerebral dysfunction, possible structural in etiology.  No clear electrographic seizures were obtained.
