CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed male with encephalopathy, jerking movements following ingestion of Soma. Past history of asthma and some sort of spinal injection.
MEDICATIONS: Soma, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient seems to be agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly slow with prominent bursts of frontally predominant delta as well as generalized high amplitude delta. These can be seen when the patient is awake and conversant. The patient was cooperative, but very uncomfortable.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bursts of frontally predominant or generalized delta.
2. Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. Consideration for a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy are appropriate. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing maybe of value.
