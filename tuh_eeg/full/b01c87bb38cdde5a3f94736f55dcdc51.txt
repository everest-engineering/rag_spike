History:	56 year old female presents on 6/29/14 after being found down unresponsive with
left sided weakness.  She is found to have right MCA/ACA stroke, s/p right
craniotomy on 6/29/14. There is no calvarium on the right side.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower
waveforms and voltage attenuation over the right.  The background over the left hemisphere
consists of a mixture of moderate amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity admixed with
periods of discontinuity.  The background over the right consists of a mixture of polymorphic
attenuated theta<<delta activity.  High amplitude prominent vertex-like waveforms often
followed voltage attenuation/ period of discontinuity are noted over the left only during periods of
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Change in the background activity to
visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli is noted.  Persistent tachycardia is seen on a single EKG
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, moderate-to-severe
Attenuation, right hemispheric
Other, reactive background
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing and moderate-
to-severe right hemispheric slowing and voltage attenuation. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Right hemispheric focal
slowing and attenuation indicate focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  Voltage
attenuation could be secondary to a fluid collection between the skull and brain, such as
hematoma, empyema etc.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  Persistent
