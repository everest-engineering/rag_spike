Medications:	Losartan, Lasix, Synthroid
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  During very brief arousal, the background consists of primarily
polymorphic moderate amplitude theta activity admixed with polymorphic delta activity.  During
majority of the recording, the background consists of low-to-moderate amplitude delta>theta and
occasional periods of discontinuity.  There is no clear sustained focal slowing.  Symmetrical sleep
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 22 minute mostly asleep and very briefly awake EEG due to
moderate diffuse slowing. that is etiologically nonspecific indicator of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  Some fragments of normal sleep architecture
