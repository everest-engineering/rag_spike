CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old male admitted 1 day ago following multiple seizures with postictal amnesia.  Past history of epilepsy and alcohol abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a technically challenging EEG for a patient who was very sweaty.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is generous diffuse beta.  A 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm can be identified at times.  Patient drifts off to sleep and had more diffuse beta with smaller amounts of central theta was noted.
Hyperventilation produced primarily movement artifact.  No significant background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging EEG, but it is remarkable for
generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The generous beta may be due to this patient's medications or clinical scenario.
