CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old gentleman with a  possible history of seizures in the past, dementia, delirium, and intermittent behavioral issues.  The patient admitted after an episode where he stood up with shaking, was incontinent, is  now agitated.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Haldol, Dilantin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was moving about and poorly cooperative throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the challenges noted, this EEG includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which seems to be symmetric and reactive to eye opening as well as a fair amount of muscle artifact.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing, perhaps a bit more so in the right hemisphere.
Heart rate:  Irregular 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a limited, but abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  The background slowing can be seen in many conditions including postictal state, toxic and metabolic encephalopathy as well as dementia.
