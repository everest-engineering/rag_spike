TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz and 20-70 mV.  It is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There were normal amounts of frontal central beta rhythm seen.  Stage I and stage II sleep were normal in architecture. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not produce any abnormal discharges.
