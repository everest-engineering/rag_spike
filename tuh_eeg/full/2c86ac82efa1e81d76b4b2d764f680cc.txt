CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 39-year-old male transferred from Jeanes Hospital for new onset seizures with right posterior frontal enhancing lesion, found to have cystesarcosis; no seizures reported at this time.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol , ? albendazole, Medrol, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory, low voltage 20 minute EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Frequent eye blink artifact or eye movement artifact was noted.  In drowsiness, there is very subtle, underlying slowing with disruption of faster frequency and very subtle delta noted in the right central temporal region.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  This is followed by drowsiness with attenuation of alpha and rhythmic central theta and the focal slowing described above.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with supra-harmonic driving.

Heart rate 72 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a very subtly abnormal EEG due to
1. subtle focal slowing in the right frontal central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The focal features described above are quite subtle and are in the region of this patient's CNS lesion.  The previous EEG was not available for comparison.
