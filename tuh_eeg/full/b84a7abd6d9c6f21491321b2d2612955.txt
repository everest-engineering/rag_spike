CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old male, status post code, January 14, 2015.  Past history of alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn disease and other medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol and dobutamine.
INTRODUCTION:  Technically challenging, 20 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The EKG lead was intermittently dysfunctional and the patient was in the process of a rapid complex medical assessment, hence only 20 minutes of the EEG could be recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly disorganized, but continuous pattern.  The overall background includes a mixture of theta, rhythmic theta and delta.  There are frontally predominant triphasic waves.  There are also focal sharp waves noted, poorly defined out of the sharply contoured background both left frontal or left frontotemporal.  Shifting asymmetries can be identified with at times a suggestion of slower activity on the right and at other times, a bit more arrhythmic delta activity on the left.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.
Heart rate 89 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG for this adult, less than 24 hours post cardiac arrest due to.
Replacement of normal background with a chaotic irregular theta delta pattern.
Triphasic waves some of which are asynchronous.
Sharp waves identified in the background with variable phase reversals.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This patient's metabolic features and postanoxic features may contribute to the pattern described above.  In this poorly responsive patient with repetitive eye blinking and grimacing, and EEG monitoring may be of value to search for subclinical seizures.  The eye blinking and oral facial grimacing recorded during this EEG; however, did not carry an EEG signature.
