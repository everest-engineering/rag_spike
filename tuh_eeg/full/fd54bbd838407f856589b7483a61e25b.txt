CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male presented with generalized tonic clonic seizures associated with loss of consciousness and bladder incontinence. Also had two seizures in the ED. Did not have a history of seizures. Past medical history CKD on hemodialysis, hypertension, and gout.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Heparin, Tylenol, Hydralazine, Folic Acid, Ativan, Serax, Thiamine, Aspirin, Avelox, Metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background includes an alpha rhythm of 10 Hz on the right. Alpha rhythm is a little slower on the left and there is a small amount of theta in the left hemisphere. In addition, there is disruption of faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region. As the recording continues, sharply contoured slowing is seen in the left frontotemporal region but there are no definitive sharp waves. Drowsiness seems to accentuate the focal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left temporal region with disruption of the faster frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although no sharp waves were seen, the focal slowing described above is relatively typical for that seen in epilepsy. A structural process involving gray and white matter should be considered.
