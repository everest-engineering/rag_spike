CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old male with GBM, persistent obtundation, now with
occasional ocular twitching and waxing and waning mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarbital, Gentamicin
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using
standard 10-20 _system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has
spontaneous, but is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is moderately slow from
the left. There is an identifiable alpha rhythm in the theta frequency noted on the left.
The right hemisphere includes rhythmic, more sharply-contoured 4 to 5 Hz activity in the
frontocentral regions. The patient is observed to be confused. The rhythmic frontal
sharply-contoured theta waxes and wanes. bu1 it does not clearly evolve. Although the
patient has impaired mental status, there are no definitive seizures noted in the first 20-
minute baseline.
HR: 110 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the right.
3. Paroxysmal right frontocentral theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, the overall background
is not as slow, but there is more of a picture of paroxysmal right frontocentral theta
which merits additional evaluation.
