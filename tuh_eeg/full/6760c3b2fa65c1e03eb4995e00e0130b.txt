CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old who woke up with left-sided face, arm, and leg tingling as well as blurry vision.  Diabetes, hypertension, psychiatric illnesses with paranoia, and atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and metformin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in theta.  As the patient became drowsy, there was an increase in beta as well as an increase in delta, but he needs brief bursa of drowsiness, the overall background was quite sharply contoured.  The patient's transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep and there were shifting asymmetries.  In wakefulness and sleep, there were no definitive sharp waves, but in transition overall record was sharply contoured.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for bursts of shifting, sharply contoured slowing noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no definitive sharp waves in the awake and stage 2 sleep, section of the record is within normal limits.  Because of the characteristics described above, consideration for a more prolonged EEG may be appropriate to make sure there was no underline epileptiform activity.
