History:	43 YO FEMALE W/ DRUG OVERDOSE (BENZODIAZEPINE). HX OF PRIOR
OVERDOSE AND SEVERAL ATTEMPTED SUICIDES.
Medications:	VALPROATE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, comatose
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21 minute EEG, awake and drowsy. A normal EEG does not rule out the clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or for
more longer periods may be helpful.
