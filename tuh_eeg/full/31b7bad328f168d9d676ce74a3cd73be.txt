Medications:	DIOVAN,CYCLOBENZAPRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm which at best reached 7Hz was present.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Bursts of diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Some reactivity to verbal commands
is seen.  Hr was 96 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Triphasic waves, frequent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
