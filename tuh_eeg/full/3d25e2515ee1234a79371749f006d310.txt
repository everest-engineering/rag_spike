CLINICAL HISTORY:  82 year old right handed woman with a left-sided lesion in May with right hemiparesis and 2 episodes of incontinence.  Multiple seizures recorded May 13.  The patient had a craniotomy 4 weeks ago, was evaluated at the University of Pennsylvania earlier this month for recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, Depakote, Dilantin, Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is at times poorly organized and bilaterally slow.  In other sections, there is a more significant asymmetry with a pattern on the right that is only mildly slow and an alpha rhythm of 8 Hz on the right.  The alpha rhythm tends to be slower on the left, and there is disruption of faster frequency activity on the left with occasional sharp waves.  Features of drowsiness include more of a bilateral background slow pattern and shifting slowing. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is confused.  There is scant driving on the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left with disruption of faster frequency activity and arrhythmic delta activity.
Occasional sharp waves in the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region.
Background slowing on the right which is variable, sometimes only moderately slow.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  She has previously been evaluated for repetitive seizures.  The right hemisphere may be a little bit slower than in the past, but the left hemisphere is not quite as remarkably slow.  These findings can be compared to the long-term monitoring and follow-up EEGs from May 2012.
