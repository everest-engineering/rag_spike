CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old right handed woman with AFib, stroke, seizures, dementia, presented with altered mental status, rapid or fluctuating heart rate.  Prior right MCA and left ACA infarcts.
MEDICATIONS:  Depacon, Meropenem, Insulin, Zocor, Metoprolol, ASA, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background, but as the patient starts to relax, pattern of theta is identified.  The record is substantially slower in the right hemisphere compared to the left.   The recorded substantially slow in the hemisphere compared to the left.  There are occasional sharp waves noted primarily in the right hemisphere in the frontocentral region, although there are a handful in the left posterotemporal region.
HR:   90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Focal slowing with faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
Sharp waves on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is similar to a previous EEG January 12, 2012.  The 2005 and 2008 EEGs were not available.
