CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed man with epilepsy since 2008.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving. Hyperventilation elicits notched, high-amplitude 3 Hz activity compatible with a spike in the way of activity which persists after the patient concludes the hyperventilation.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. The appearance of 3 Hz spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The EEG activity with 3 Hz spike and wave activity suggests a generalized mechanism for epilepsy. The patient informed the tech that he was out of his seizure medicine. Although clinical information is paramount, the EEG pattern suggests a medication other than phenytoin would be the appropriate clinical choice, for generalized seizures with 3 Hz spike wave
