History:	58 Y/O FEMALE L HANDED. GENERALIZED MOTOR,RT,LT ARM LEG,H/O
CEREBRAL PALSY.  NOTE RAN EMG ON LAST MONTAGE!!!!!!
Medications:	VALPROIC ACID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Very frequent brief bursts (1-1.5 seconds) of symmetric generalized
frontally-maximal spike-and-wave discharges and polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur with a
regular repetition rate of  4-4.5Hz.  There is an associated clinical correlate of arm jerking with each
of the spikes. The patient did appear to be conscious and following commands during the entire
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Hr was 108
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, frequent generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of frequent generalized spike-and-wave and polyspike-
and-wave discharges with a muscle correlate consistent with cortical myoclonus.  These findings
can be consistent with a generalized epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
