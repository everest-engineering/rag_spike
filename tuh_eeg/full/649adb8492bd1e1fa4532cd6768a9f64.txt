History:	28 YR MALE WITH SZS.  HAD SZ YESTERDAY PER MOM HANDS SHAKING. PMHX: HOLOPROSENCEPHALY, SCHIZENCEPHALY, PACHI GYRI, MENTALLY CHALLENGED MICROCEPHALIC (HEAD 52.5 CM)
Medications:	PHENOBARBITAL/ TRILEPTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
