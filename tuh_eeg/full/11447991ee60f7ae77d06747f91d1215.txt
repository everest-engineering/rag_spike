Date of study is 20th through 21st.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Massive subarachnoid hemorrhage with bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages and right ventriculostomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Patient has intermittent eye movement.  No clinical seizures or involuntary movements, which were thought to be seizure were noted in the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The right hemisphere is a lower voltage, attenuated pattern.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a pattern of arrhythmic delta activity with periodicity of 1.5 Hz.  This slow delta waxes and wanes.  Although there is some sections of the record with significant artifact, there are sections of the record where the activity seems to abate to more of a lower voltage pattern.  In addition, there is intermittent fast activity noted particularly in the left occipital region.  No clinical correlates were noted with this activity.
Lorazepam was given with Vimpat at approximately 11:00 p.m.  The EEG has improved by 1:21 a.m., but the record continues to wax and wane with the periodic activity in the left hemisphere.
Heart rate 104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 24 hour section of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Slow, periodic activity in the left hemisphere, which waxes and wanes.
Markedly low voltage, slow pattern from the right.
Clinical Correlation:  Although no discrete seizures are noted, the pattern described above may be a late ictal pattern.  The findings were discussed with the clinical team, who will step up of pharmacologic therapy at this time.
