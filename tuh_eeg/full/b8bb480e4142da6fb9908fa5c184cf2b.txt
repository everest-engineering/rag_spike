History:	41 YR MALE PMHX: SEIZURES, BARRETTS ESOPHAGUS,   ESOPHAGEAL
SPASMS   HYPOTHYROIDISM, PROFOUND MR.  PRESENTED WITH  FALL.
FOUND TO HAVE LEFT BRAIN MASS AND EDEMA
Medications:	TEGRETOL, RISPERDAL, TRAZODONE, COGENTIN, ATIVAN, NICOTINE PATCH,
RIBAVIRIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral fronto-temporal region.  Occasional
focal spike-and-wave discharges are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F3,
T3 and independently at T4, C4 and F4 .  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, frequent, bilateral multifocal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges arising from multiple
regions.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic foci and consistent with
multifocal epilepsy. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the bilateral fronto temporal
regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. Lastly there is moderate
diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
