History: 64 Y 0 FEMALE WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS WI AGITATION AND UNABLE TO SLEEP AFTER KEPPRA WAS INCREASED.PMH: HTN, CVA,L OCCIPITAL ICH 2011,SP L VP SHUNT/I/ FOLLOW UP DUE TO PT MENTAL STATUS, DECREASE KEPPRA. STOPPED VIMPAT POSTICTAL STATE/ PT REMAINS
Medications: Vimpat
Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, lethargic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening but can be best seen over the right hemisphere. No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present In the left hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. Frequent at times rhythmic focal sharp waves are present In the left anterior temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F71T3.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Electrographic Seizures: During the record there were 3 electrographic seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region and spreading to the right hemisphere. They lasted 45 seconds to 1 minute. The video reveals the patient tying in bed with no clear clinical correlate. HR is 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Seizure, frequent left temporal, anterior, 3 electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This Is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of electrographic status epilepticus arising from the left anterior temporal region. In addition there is evidence of local structural dysfunction and Irritability in the left anterior temporal region which may be related To the known left ICH.
