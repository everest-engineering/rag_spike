History:	64 Y/O MALE PMHX OF ASTHMA, ARTHRITIS. PT PRESENTS TO HOSPITAL
AFTER HAVING 2 SZ AT HOME FOLLOWED BY 4 MORE IN ED. ATIVAN X5,
PROPOFOL DRIP,
Medications:	PROPOFOL DRIP 9.7 ML/HR, ATIVAN X5
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. There is a superimposed diffuse beta.  There are also intermittent 1 second periods of
diffuse attenuation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
