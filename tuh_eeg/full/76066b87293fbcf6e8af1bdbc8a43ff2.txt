LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 25-year-old man with a history of cognitive impairment and seizures.  He had an episode of shaking and falling that occurred several days ago.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran, Depakote, and triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic poorly formed 8.5 to 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is present, but fragmented at times.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta is captured.  During drowsiness diffuse bursts of slow theta and increase in the amount of central beta is observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.
No stage 2 sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.  This finding indicates etiologic nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If a clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
