CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed male with a history of childhood head trauma, post traumatic epilepsy, breakthrough seizure after medications were discontinued. Transferred from an outside hospital on July 31, 2010 with status epilepticus, but awake and alert on presentation.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Atropine, Cipro, Tobrex, Heparin, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes alpha rhythm with generous low voltage frontocentral beta activity. There is a suggestion of breach in the left with accentuation of beta in that region. There are bursts of asynchronous frontal delta which are sharply contoured. This individual demonstrates a fair amount of muscle artifact into sleep. The end of the record is a bit more organized then the initial sections. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Occasional bursts frontally predominant asynchronous slowing.
3. A handful of bursts of sharply contoured slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Better definition of this patient's epileptiform activity may be obtained using a more prolonged sleep record or a record when he is more comfortable to eliminate the muscle artifact obtained.
