CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with childhood epilepsy, seizure free for an extended period of time.

MEDICATIONS: Singulair, Zyrtec Asthma.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkably low voltage with a 9.7 hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Mu rhythm is noted, but testing is not performed to confirm this. The Mu activity is 10 hertz. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. The vertex waves are to the right of the midline. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A consistent pattern of vertex waves phase reversing to the right of the midline.
Because of this single abnormality, these findings may be an artifact. Therefore, it is recommended that this EEG be reported to make sure that this is in fact a biological phenomenon. The asymmetric vertex waves could be correlated with exam and imaging should there be a focal process.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of this single abnormality, these findings may be an artifact. Therefore, it is recommended that this EEG be reported to make sure that this is in fact a biological phenomenon. The asymmetric vertex waves could be correlated with exam and imaging should there be a focal process.
