History:	52 year old woman with a history of seizures, tremors, MI.
Medications:	Dilantin, Neurontin, Aspirin and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Patient has intermittent head tremors throughout the recording characterized
by EMG artifact.  Tremors intensify with hyperventilation/ post hyperventilation.
Summary of Findings:
Other, intermittent head and arm tremors
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake-only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
