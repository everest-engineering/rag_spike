CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed woman with a history of head trauma including a subdural hematoma, now seizure free for perhaps 5-10 years.  History of bur hole in the central region.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes generous beta.  There is beta accentuation in the left central region. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  There is a small amount of shifting slowing in the central region noted following hyperventilation in the transition to sleep.  There is also occasional isolated slowing in the right or left central region.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Prominent beta.
The breach rhythm seems to be more prominent on the left today, but in 2009 she was noted to have a breach on the right.
Rare shifting slowing in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG without epileptiform activity for this individual.  The central slowing in an adult of this age with previous head trauma is
nonspecific, and could be correlated with imaging should the patient be able to tolerate an imaging study.
