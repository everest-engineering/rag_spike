REASON FOR STUDY:  Preop for arch replacement.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG is performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with one channel of EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded mainly in sleep with some limited wakefulness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, amlodipine, gabapentin, lovastatin, pantoprazole and Zetia.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activity and procedures included photic stimulation which produced non-normal discharges.  The patient was recorded mainly in sleep, stage I and stage II, and the patient did have a very short sleep latency.  Throughout the recording, he will be aroused and go back to sleep quickly.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Heart rate:  76.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG, mainly in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG, mainly in sleep.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were noted.  Please note that the patient did have very short sleep latency and further evaluation for sleep disturbance may be helpful.
