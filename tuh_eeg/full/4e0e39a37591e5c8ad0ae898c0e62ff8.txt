History:	63 YR FEMALE S/P LIVER TX (ETOH) CIRRHOSIS, VARICES H/O, CKD3, GERD,
HTN, WITH EVAL HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
Medications:	PROGRAF, INSULIN, PROTONIX, MYCAMINE, ACTIGALL, CIPRO, HEPARIN,
NOREPINEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was mild reactivity to auditory,
tactile, and painful stimuli.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, continuous, marked frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
