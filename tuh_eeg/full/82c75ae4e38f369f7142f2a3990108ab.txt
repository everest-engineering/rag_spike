History:	67 YO MALE BROUGHT TO ED FOR RIGHT ARM SHAKING IN THE AM, LASTING
A COUPLE OF MIN. WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW COMMANDS W/ NO CHANGE IN
MENTAL STATUS. PMHX: CABG, S/P STENT, MI, CKD, HTN, COPD, ISCHEMIC
CARDIOMYOPATHY, ANEMIA, STROKE, IDDM, C-DIFF, CONTINUE..
Medications:	INSULIN, METOPROLOL, ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2
sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60 and irregular at times.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild excessive theta in
wakefulness and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
