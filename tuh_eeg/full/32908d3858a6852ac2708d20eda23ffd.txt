CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male status post AVM surgery in 1990 with tonic clonic seizures in March 2010 followed by postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Tegretol, Keppra, Ferrous sulfate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz 30 microvolts symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness, there is a small amount of subtle slowing in the left mid and central temporal regions. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness due to:
1. Subtle slowing from the left frontocentral region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: A breech rhythm is identified in the left frontal region in the limited drowsy record find above. No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG or the study done earlier this year. If further characterization of this individuals epileptiform focus is needed, a more prolonged sleep study is suggested.
