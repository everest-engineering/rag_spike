SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is low voltage but symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by	Scant, symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, is a prominent increase in beta and rhythmic central theta
Sleep gauge 2 sleep was not sustained
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Deferred
Photic Stimulation: Scant driving identified EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during
this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
There is a low-voltage pattern with generous beta but this is a normal finding in the subject of this age
There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
