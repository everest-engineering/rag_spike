CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, mesiotemporal sclerosis, HIV disease, liver failure, hepatitis C, admitted with left facial twitching and rhythmic mouth movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra, Truvada
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  EEG demonstrates a 9-Hz alpha rhythm on the left.  There is a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right, occasional periodic or sharply contoured delta, and subtle sharp waves picked up in the right temporal region, typically T2/T4.  A handful are maximum in the lateral temporal chains, but actually phase reversed at T1.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing.  In sleep, the temporal sharp waves sometimes have more of a posterior temporal field.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere, maximal in the right temporal region.
Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
Right temporal sharp waves, most of which are anterior temporal, but in sleep transition to a posterior temporal lobe parietal focus.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  No seizures were recorded.  The patient's mental status was perhaps a bit more impaired than might be expected given the more awake pattern identified on the left.
