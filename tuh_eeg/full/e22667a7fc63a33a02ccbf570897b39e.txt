CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old woman with daily complex partial seizures, which can be triggered by extraocular movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with one clinical event.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with some eye movement artifact and EKG artifact, but a small amount of temporal shifting slowing.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Clinical event was elicited by asking the patient to open her eyes and follow commands.  The EEG at that time identified a normal awake pattern with eye movement artifact.  The patient describes slow mentation and had difficulty following commands.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG at the limits of normal for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features.  The features described above and drowsiness are nonspecific findings.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study may be of use.  Alternatively, this study may be compared with previous records.
