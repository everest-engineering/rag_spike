History:	56 YR OLD MALE FOUND DOWN FROM UNKNOWN PERIOD IN BURNING HOUSE.
TREATED APPROX 15-20 MIN IN FIELD,  ANOXIC INJ NEURO EVAL.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There are
intermittent bursts that commence mainly with a left midtemporal delta discharge followed by
bifrontal predominant generalized rhythmic slowing for ~2-5 seconds. There is an intermixed eye
opening artifact at times.  On video the patient appears to open and close his eyes and at time
have a slow flutter during the burst.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic sharply countoured delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region
independent of the burst at times.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, continuous, severe diffuse, left asymmetric onset to many bursts.
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background attenuation and burst
suppression.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The bursts appear to have an asymmetric onset and a clinical correlate. The nature of
the bursts is unclear but do not appear to be epileptic.  Continuous EEG monitoring is
recommended to better evaluate and understand the nature of the discharges.
