History:	72 YO MALE P/W UNRESPONSIVENESS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE
RIGHT ARM. SYMPTOMS MAY HAVE STARTED OVERNIGHT, CHANGE WAS
NOTED BY FAMILY AT LUNCH, WHEN THEY CALLED EMS.
Medications:	HEPARIN, METOPROLOL,ASA, ENALAPRILAT
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region independently
(left more than right) during wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
independent mid temporal region (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
