History:	60 YR MALE WITH CC GTC SZ.  PMHX: HTN, HLD, AORTIC DISSECTION, ETOH
ABUSE, H/O PE.  PT HAS SEVERAL ADM LAST WITH EEG 12/2.//// 1/24/14
FOUND DOWN ON 1/23/14 S/P FALL, CTH SHOWED ACUTE B/L SDH, OFF
PROPOFOL SINCE 5AM.
Medications:	KEPPRA, THIAMINE, FOLIC ACID, ESMOLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
A fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm was present that achieved only 7 Hz and was reactive to
eye opening.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage theta activity with
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation did not activate the tracing.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  mild diffuse background theta slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
