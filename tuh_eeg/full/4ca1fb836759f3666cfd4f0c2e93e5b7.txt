CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old right handed male with epilepsy following stroke and
carotid endarterectomy 30 years ago. Currently seizure free for more than 5 years.
The patient reported to the doctor no seizures. He reported to the technologist that he
has brief episodes where he feels a little unwell.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Levetiracetam, Enalapril, Ecotrin, Pravastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not
completed but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Arrhythmic delta is noted from the left mid to posterior temporal region with occasional
disruption of faster frequency activity. This activity typically occurs in bursts and is
somewhat sharply contoured and may be maximum at T3 or T5. Vertex waves and
posts are observed in stage 2 sleep. The focal slowing is a bit more prominent In the
posterior regions in sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response particularly at
faster frequencies.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left mid to posterior temporal focal slowing accentuated by sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were seen. The patient's
previous EEGs were not available for comparison. This EEG supports a structural
abnormality, congruent with the patient's history.
