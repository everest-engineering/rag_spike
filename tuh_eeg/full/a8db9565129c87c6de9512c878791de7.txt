Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  After induction the background is noted be  a mixture of moderate voltage
theta and delta activity with overriding beta.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60  Induction occurred at
8:57AM. Stent Deployed at 10:39AM and 11:14AM. Graft at 11:27AM. Balloon deployed at
12:02PM.  No asymmetric changes seen during the procedure.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful 3.5 hour EEG during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair surgery. The was
also intermittent focal slowing in the left mid temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
