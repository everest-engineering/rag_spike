History:	54 YR OLD MALE PRESENTED ON 8/19/2015 WITH H/O SEVERE SEPSIS OF UNKNOWN SOURCE. WAS ON THREE PRESSORS, TAKEN OFF SEDATION, PT NOT RESPONDING.
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
None
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and subtemporal chain and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and at times diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory and tactile stimuli.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
