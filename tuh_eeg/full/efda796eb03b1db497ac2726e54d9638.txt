Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent generalized  frontally-maximal spikes and wave are present
at a frequency of 3.5-4.0Hz with burst lasting less than 2 secs.  At times they have a slightly
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, intermittent generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent generalized spike-and-
wave discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise normal.
These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
