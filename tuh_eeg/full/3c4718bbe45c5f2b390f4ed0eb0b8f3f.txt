History:	23 year old female experiencing flashes of color, red and blue light in both eyes at
all times and numbness and tingling in her right and left hand fingers.
PMHX has spastic cerebral palsy, asthma
Medications:	Albuterol, Dulera, Gabapentin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL one hour EEG, awake and to stage I sleep.  No epileptiform discharges were
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
