CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old "NH" female with seizures, expressive aphasia, traumatic brain injury, stroke, gun shot wound to the head, right frontal craniotomy, right-sided contractures, right-sided skull defect, bur hold at C4.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lamictal, Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage slow pattern with a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity on the right compared to the left. In addition, there is more faster frequency noted on the right than the left. The left is a little lower voltage and is more featureless. As the recording continues, the patient is increasingly awake and an alpha rhythm is observed on the right.
HR:    104 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing identified bilaterally, improving over the course of the record.
Asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right and slower pattern on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified. The improvement over time may be seen following a seizure or any other abrupt CNS insult.
