History:	42 year old man with a history of seizures and status epilepticus, who presented with
right sided shaking and received tPA.
Medications:	Keppra, phenobarbital
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The waking background consists of low amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye
opening.  The AP gradient is weak.  Low amplitude underriding excess beta activity is noted.
Vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.
Voltages are attenuated over the left hemisphere.  Occasional polymorphic delta activity is
observed over the left hemisphere.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, mild, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left hemispheric
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to occasional moderate left
hemispheric slowing and left hemispheric voltage attenuation. These findings indicate focal
cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
