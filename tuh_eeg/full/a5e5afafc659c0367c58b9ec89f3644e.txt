REASON FOR STUDY:  Dementia, syncopal events.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 92-year-old woman with dementia and syncopal events and history of falls from the nursing home.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, aspirin, Colace, Zoloft, acetaminophen.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some frontal electrode muscle artifact seen continuously throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at best 7.5 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Heart rate:  72.
Seizures:  None.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slow waves seen continuously at 5-7 Hz throughout the recording at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
