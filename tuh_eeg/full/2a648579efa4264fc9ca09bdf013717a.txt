History:	48 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ DISORDER AS A CHILD, BECAME
SZ FREE AT AGE 12 THEN BREAKTHROUGH SZ 09/2005, SZ ARE W/LOC, B/B
INCONT, SHAKING LASTING 1-2 MIN W/POSTICTAL CONFUSION. PT HAS AURA
OF SEEING LIGHTS AND FEELING IN STOMACH, LAST  SZ 11/201
Medications:	LORAZEPAM / DC'D FROM DILANTIN AND TEGRETOL X 2 MOS. AGO
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive  symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes
more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
