HISTORY: 57 year old right handed woman with 2 episodes of loss of
consciousness in 2010 for which she was amnestic, restless leg syndrome.
MEDICATIONS: Plavix.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
This is an awake and drowsy record.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with
a generous amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Muscle artifact is picked up in
the EEG, although looking at the video it is hard to see that the patient is moving. Some
of the muscle artifact looks as if she is clenching her jaw. Brief drowsiness is
characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 72 bpm
Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed. If epilepsy is
an important consideration, a follow up study capturing sleep is suggested.
