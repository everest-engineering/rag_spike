CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old left handed man with a history of gunshot wound to the head and a shunt with a history of cocaine abuse.  EEG for follow up.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of gunshot wound to the head and shunt.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves at CZ/C4 seen intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing at CZ/C4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right central region which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
