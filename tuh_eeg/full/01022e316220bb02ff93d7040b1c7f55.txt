CLINICAL HISTORY: 93 year old patient with memory impairment for 2 to 3 months.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonable well-organized but is rhythmically slow at the 7 Hz, 50 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of arrhythmic delta activity. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. This EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. The features described above are relatively characteristic of those noted in Alzheimer's disease although it is a nonspecific pattern.
