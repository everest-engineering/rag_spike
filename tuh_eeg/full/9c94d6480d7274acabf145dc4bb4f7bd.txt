History:	83 year old woman with a history of left temporal ICH.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 8.5-9 Hz alpha activity posteriorly with
expected AP gradient.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Continuous polymorphic and rhythmic moderate amplitude sharply contoured theta and delta
activity is present in the left temporal region.  Intermittent sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves
are captured  over the left anterior temporal region (F7/T3 maximal).  Despite presence of a lot of
rhythmicity in the left temporal region, there is no clear evolution into ictal runs.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Rare premature QRS complexes are
captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal, and rhythmic
Sharp waves, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 22-minute awake-only portable EEG due to continuous moderate polymorphic
and rhythmic focal slowing over the left temporal region as well as intermittent left anterior
temporal epileptiform discharges. There is a structural focal cerebral abnormality with increased
epileptiform potential over the left temporal region - initiation of an AED may be warranted in this
