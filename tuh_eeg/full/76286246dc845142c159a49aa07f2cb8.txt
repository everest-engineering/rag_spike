CLINICAL HISTORY:   81 year old right handed gentleman with a right-sided subdural hematoma, status post drainage of the hematoma x2 with an episode of syncope, versus seizure, versus confusion earlier this spring.
MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Theragran, Zocor, Risperdal, Trileptal
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is initially quite reluctant to cooperate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 to 8 Hz, 50 microvolts, identified bilaterally, but sometimes interrupted on the right.  In addition, the amplitude of the alpha rhythm reaches 70 microvolts on the right.  Although the EEG is disorganized from both hemispheres, a rhythmic delta is noted in the right central region with a right centroparietal sharp wave noted in a sharply contoured background.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central and parietal focal slowing.
Right central sharp waves.
Background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  This EEG is similar to previous study in November of 2011.  This patient
has had PLEDS in association with acute subdural hematoma, but none were identified today.
