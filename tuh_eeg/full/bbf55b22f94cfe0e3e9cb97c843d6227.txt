AGE: 24 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 95819 (1 hour ordered, 24 minutes completed)
EEG i: 15-1368
HISTORY:
24 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for persistent seizures and headaches. Seizures since age 12
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take two tablets twice daily
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
butalbital-acetaminophen-caffeine (FIORICET, ESGIC) per tablet, SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Focal slowing is present: noted in wakefulness and drowsiness, with burst of L temporal theta/delta, sometimes reaching 3 seconds duration.
Generalized slowing is present: occasional bitemporal bursts of delta/theta were seen.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Left temporal sharp waves, Tl/F7 awake and drowsy OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: accentuates L temporal focal slowing Photic Stimulation: elicits bilateral driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.
l. Left temporal focal slow
2. Left temporal sharp waves. CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This abnormal awake-and-drowsy EEG is similar to priors including and supports localization related epilepsy.
