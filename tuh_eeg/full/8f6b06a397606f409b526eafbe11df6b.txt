History:	63 YO MAN WITH SEIZURE EVENT IN THE AM THE DAY BEFORE LASTING
SEVERAL MIN, WITH STIFFENING, SHAKING AND VOMITING W/O LOC.
PMHX: SCHIZOPHRENIA, GERD, DEPRESSION, HTN, CAD
Medications:	ASA, HEPARIN, RISPERDAL, ISOSORBIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Short sleep latency.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The short sleep latency may be suggestive of
A sleep disorder
