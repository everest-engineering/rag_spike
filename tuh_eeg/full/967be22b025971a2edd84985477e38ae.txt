CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 41-year-old woman who while driving home from night shift work, woke up having an accident.  The patient was told by the emergency room she might have had a seizure.  As a result of the accident, she sustained a broken arm.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
LENGTH OF RECORDING:  28 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  Fast alpha variant is intermittently observed.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency of 2 gradients with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, POSTS (posterior occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.  Ventilation is produced with a fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a regular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
Epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 28 minute EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
