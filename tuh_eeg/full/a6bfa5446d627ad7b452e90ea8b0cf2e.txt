History:	74 year old woman undergoing left CEA.


INCISION: 8:41AM
HEPARIN: 9:11AM 5000U
CLAMP: 9:16AM
UNCLAMP: EXT 10:08AM ALL 10:12AM
Medications:	INDUCTION: FENTANYL, PROPOFOL, LIDOCAINE, ROCURONIUM,
SURGERY: ISOFLURANE, PHENYLEPHRINE, FENTANYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Patient is awake at the beginning of the recording.  The background consists of 10 Hz PDR,
expected AP gradient, excess theta and beta activity and brief bursts of diffuse large amplitude
delta activity.  Once general anesthesia is initiated, the background consists of a mixture of
polymorphic frequencies, overriding delta and underriding fast activity and occasional periods of
background discontinuity.  Left internal carotid artery is clamped at 9:16:38 am and external carotid
artery is clamped at 9:16:39 am.  No change in the background is appreciated.  Left external
carotid artery is unclamped at 10:08:37 am and left internal carotid artery is unclamped at 10:12:
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable ~2 hour continuous intraoperative EEG monitoring during the left CEA.  I
was personally present during the clamping of the left external and internal carotid arteries.
Findings were communicated to the surgeon regularly.
