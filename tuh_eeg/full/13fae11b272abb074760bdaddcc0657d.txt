INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE NOTE
Routine EEG was performed using 10-20 electrode placement systems with EKG electrode. The patient was obtunded to
comatose on exam. No activation procedures were performed.
MEDICATIONS:
Ativan, Zocor, gentamicin, Protonix, aspirin, and Lovenox.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
Sweating artifact, movement artifact.
HISTORY:
A 41-year-old woman with a past medical history of anxiety, alcohol use, anemia, high cholesterol, depression, and
Pancreatitis status post left MCA stroke, now status post hemicraniectomy
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG background is diffusely slow with polymorphic delta seen and with no posterior dominant rhythm seen. There is
marked high amplitude left hemispheric polymorphic delta maximal over the F7/T3 electrodes with loss of faster
frequencies. There is marked muscle artifact over the right hemisphere and occasional polymorphic delta/theta seen over
the F8/T 4. No normal sleep architecture is seen. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. The
patient's EEG does not change with stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves present: Left hemisphere maximal at F7/T3 (2-4 Hz and 20-75 microvolts) seen continuously with
associated loss of faster frequencies.
2. Focal slow waves present: F8/T4 (2-4Hz and 20-75 microvolts) present occasionally.
3. Diffuse slow waves.
SEIZURE:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to
1. Continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region
2. Intermittent right anterior temporal slowing
3. Diffuse flow waves seen
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG reveals evidence of left hemisphere structural cerebral dysfunction seen maximally in the anterior temporal
region, which is consistent with the known stroke. There is additional evidence of right anterior temporal focal cerebral
dysfunction and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
