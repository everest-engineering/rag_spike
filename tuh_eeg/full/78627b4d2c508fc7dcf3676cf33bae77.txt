BREAST CA WITH METS.
PRIORS
P/W FALL 7/28/2015 ? SZ
Medications:	TRAZODONE, PROTONIX, PHENOBARBITAL, VIMPAT, DILAUDID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background consists of continuous periodic diffuse
frontally predominant sharp waves with triphasic morphology occurring at 2Hz. These waveforms
demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior temporal region.  Frequent
sharp waves are present  with phase reversal at T6.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 108
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, continuous, severe diffuse
Sharp waves, frequent, right temporal, posterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin. I addition there is  frequent
epileptiform discharges and continuous focal in the right posterior temporal region.  These findings
are indicative of a structural cortical lesion that is potentially epileptogenic located in this region.
