History:	62 year old woman who is comatose
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 23 hours from 11/5/2014 to 11/6/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude delta  and scant theta activity.  With stimulation, triphasic waveforms appear.  No normal
sleep architecture is present.
There is relative paucity of faster frequencies over the left.  No clear seizures are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Seizure, not recorded
Triphasic waves, occasional
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24-hour continuous video EEG due to severe diffuse slowing and occasional
triphasic waveforms. Diffuse slowing indicates severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient is at least partially related to the medication effect.  No
clear seizures are captured.  Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in
hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and anoxia.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
