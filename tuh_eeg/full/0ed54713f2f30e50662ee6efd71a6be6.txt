CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right-handed woman with multiple right occipital hemangiomas, thrombosis, headaches, and visual hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Xanax, Proventil, Donnatal,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the left hemisphere demonstrates a well-organized pattern with a symmetric reaction of 9 Hz alpha rhythm but arrhythmic delta activity seen in the right occipital region with disruption of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous right occipital focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right effecting gray and white matter and is congruent with this patient's clinical history. If her hallucinations are paroxysmal, additional EEG recording might be useful.
