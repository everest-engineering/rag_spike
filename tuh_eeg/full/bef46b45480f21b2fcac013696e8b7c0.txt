History:	30 YR MALE WITH CC OF SZS SINCE 2006 POST TBI . INCREASE IN FREQ
ABOUT 1 A MONTH.  PT STATES FEELS FUNNY THEN LOC/GTC.  PT ALSO
STATES HAS MI WITH CODE 8/13.? ALSO PMHX: OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE
Medications:	Vimpat, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse 7Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Excess theta during wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of diffuse background slowing.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
