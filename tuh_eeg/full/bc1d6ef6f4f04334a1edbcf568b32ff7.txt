CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old woman, anoxic insult, PEA code for 40 minutes.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Atropine, Lasix, Lipitor, Heparin, Pantoprazole, Hydralazine, Versed

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated, comatose with minimal brainstem findings.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is a pattern of generalized, periodic activity which is identified bilaterally.  In contrast to the previous EEG, it is not such as a clearly ictal pattern, but there is some waxing and waning.  There is prominent focality in the right hemisphere and then left posterior region.  Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  There is some muscle artifact noted in the background, but no clinical activity noted.

HR:   110 bpm

IMPRESSION/CORRELATION:  This postanoxic pattern must be considered an epileptiform pattern.  These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
