EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present in the with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F8 more than F7.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
96  Technical difficulties:Frequent eye movement artifact seen through out the record.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral (R>L) frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the bilateral
frontotemporal regions (right more than left).  These findings are indicative of potentially
epileptogenic foci in these regions.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
