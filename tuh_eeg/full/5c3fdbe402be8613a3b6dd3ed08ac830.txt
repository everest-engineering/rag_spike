History:	56 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NEW ONSET EPISODE OF LOC W/
BLADDER INCONT, CONFUSION  X 2 WEEKS AGO, PT STATES THAT SHE WAS
BACK TO BASELINE 1-2 MIN. PMHX SIG FOR HEAD INJURY AND LT CVA 9/2012
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal (F7/T3) region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
