History:	88 year old man status post right hemispheric SDH evacuation several days ago,
now with frequent episodes of head turning to the left and accompanied visual
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
The background consists of low-to-moderate amplitude 8.5 Hz alpha activity posteriorly with
preserved AP gradient.  Continuous voltage attenuation is noted over the right temporo-occipital
region.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
Three seizures are captured, lasting ~ 4 minutes, ~3.25 minutes and ~ nearly 2 minutes.  There is
no clear clinical correlate and patient is not formally tested.  Seizures start with high amplitude
T4/t6 and P4 rhythmic broad sharp waves.  They rapidly decrease in amplitude and evolve in low-
to-moderate amplitude fast activity that is seen throughout the right hemisphere.  Then there is
evolution of the activity in amplitude and decrease in frequency to slow rhythmic delta that is most
pronounced over the right midtemporal- parietooccipital region.
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, right, temporoparietal
Attenuation, continuous, right, temporooccipital
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal awake-only portable 21-minute EEG due to focal temporoparietal status
epilepticus/ seizures that do not appear to have any overt clinical manifestations. These findings are
indicative of an epileptogenic focus in this region.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology
consult team and patient was placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
