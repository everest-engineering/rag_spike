AGE: 73 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, asleep only EEG #: 15-1812
HISTORY:
73 y.o. male who presented with a 3-day history of altered mental status, found to have a left frontal intracranial hemorrhage. He is referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous and symmetric, but consists of poorly organized delta with admixed theta. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.
The background is not clearly reactive. State change is not captured .
There is severe generalized slowing.
No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
There are continuous sharply contoured delta waves with superimposed sharply contoured beta frequencies, periodic at 1 Hz, diffusely over the left hemisphere, with reflection over the right (bilateral asymmetric lateralized periodic discharges, also known as PLEDs or
LPD+FR) .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate in the 130s, with occasional pauses up to 1.2 seconds, is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal asleep only routine EEG due to:
Severe generalized slowing, with lack of clear reactivity
Background disorganization
Left hemispheric lateralized periodic discharges (LPD+FR)
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of left hemispheric highly epileptogenic potentials superimposed on severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
A single EKG lead captured tachycardia but with occasional pauses up to 1.2 seconds
Following this study the patient was continued on long term monitoring.
