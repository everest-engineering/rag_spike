History:	31 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH 4-5 YEAR HISTORY OF
EPILEPSY.SEIZURES DESCRIBED AS LOC, SHAKING AND TONGUE BITING.
LAST SZ 1/2014. CURRENTLY PREGNANT (HIGH RISK)
Medications:	DC'D HERSELF FROM TOPAMAX 8/13 , PRE-NATAL VITAMINS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
