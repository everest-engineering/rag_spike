CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed man with a history of renal failure presents with breakthrough seizures secondary to noncompliance with medications and recurring confusion.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Heparin.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a slow posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a decreased amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.  The patient is recorded in stage I and stage II sleep as well as deeper stages of sleep including REM.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts seen continuously.
2. At times, intermittently while awake with eyes open, there is an anterior rhythmic delta activity consistent with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slowing.
2. FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Lastly, the patient did fall into deeper stages of sleep.  REM was noted during a routine study, which is not typical; therefore, clinical consideration for the possibility of a coexistent sleep disorder is advised.
