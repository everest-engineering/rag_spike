INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in tile lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 mcV alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta.
Drowsiness is characterize-d by an increase in beta and a small amount of theta. stage I sleep: Normal vertex waves, no
spindles. Hyperventilation did not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicited Vigorous driving with harmonic and
supraharmonic driving.
Heart Rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No epileptiform feature-s were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information
is needed. a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
