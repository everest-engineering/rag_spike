CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 61-year-old woman with persistent obtundation following brain surgery with seizures several days ago.  Interval history unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During this section of the record, there are portions of the record, particularly on the morning of the 6th, where the EEG demonstrates frequent right temporal sharp waves.  The patient remains poorly responsive.  Later portions of the record are characterized by muscle and movement artifact.  There is an awake and asleep pattern with some portions of the record demonstrating more muscle and more faster frequency activity.  At the close of this 24-hour epoch, the background EEG is lower voltage with less in the way of sharp and slow wave complexes, which are smaller, more discrete and maximum in the right anterior temporal region.
