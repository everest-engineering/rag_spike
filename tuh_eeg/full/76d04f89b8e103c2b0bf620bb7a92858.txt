CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed woman with epilepsy which began 4 years ago, seizures described as shaking, hands twitching, punching with confusion lasting for 15-30 minutes afterwards.  Recent renal calculus requiring cystoscopy and left retrograde pyelogram.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, Ciprofloxacin, Heparin, Ativan.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well organized, high amplitude 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Generous beta and a small amount of theta are noted.  As the patient drifts off into sleep, there are occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta.

HR:    72 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess beta and excess theta are nonspecific findings which may be related to this patient's medications.  No epileptiform features
were noted.  If characterization of this patient's epilepsy is important, a repeat study in the lab is suggested.
