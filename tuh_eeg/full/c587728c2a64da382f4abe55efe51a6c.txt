CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed woman diagnosed with epilepsy in
November, tonic clonic seizures with foreign body ingestion.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Bactrim, Norvir, Reyataz, Claritin, Truvada, Trazodone, Epivir
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness there is a 10 Hz 40-50
microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central
beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and theta frequency
activity. Vertex waves are identified in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant
bilateral driving. On occasion in transition to sleep there is a small amount of shifting
theta in the left or right temporal region.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant amount of shifting theta in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are typical of those seen in an older adult.
They are quite nonspecific and can be correlated with imaging and clinical course. This
is the second EEG for this individual. Neither EEG has demonstrated epileptiform
activity. In view of the patient's complaint of headaches, these findings may be
correlated with imaging.
