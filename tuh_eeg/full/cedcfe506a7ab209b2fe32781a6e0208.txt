CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old man with seizure freedom since 2009, with a past medical history of sarcoidosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep stage I and II.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record is mainly in sleep, but the limit of wakefulness reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient mainly is seen in the recording in stage II sleep and sometimes some slow wave sleep can be also seen.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal wake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  The excess beta may be in part related to medication.  Lastly, this EEG does not reveal the previously seen left parietal slowing and sharp waves.
