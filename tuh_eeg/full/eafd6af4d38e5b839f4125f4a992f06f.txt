REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69-year-old man with a history of 2 small hemorrhages, left frontal and right periventricular of unclear etiology, now with change in mental status.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, morphine, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while slightly lethargic and agitated.  No activating procedures were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta although some of it  can be seen at times.  Activating procedures were not performed and no normal sleep architecture was seen.

Abnormal discharges:  Mild generalized slowing of 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  Please note that at times there are some bilateral mid temporal theta discharges which are slightly sharply contoured but not clearly collected, more consistent with pattern similar to rhythmic midtemporal  theta drowsiness not clearly collected.

Seizures:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
