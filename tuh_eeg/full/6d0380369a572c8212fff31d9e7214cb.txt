History:	58 YR MALE WITH BRAIN METS PRESENTED WITH SEIZURES. EYES ROLLED
BACK STIFF/ EYES DEVIATED TO LEFT WITH LUE SHAKING
Medications:	KEPPRA, SEDATED 12 PM FOR INTUBATION.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.There is an overriding 8-9Hz discharge seen over the the delta. However,  there is an
asymmetry in faster frequencies with the 8-9Hz discharge only seen over the right hemisphere and
clearly absent over the entire left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
There is an asymmetry in faster frequencies with a diffuse 8-9Hz discharge seen over the right
hemisphere which is absent over the entire left hemisphere..  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 168
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked, left hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous attenuation of faster frequencies over the
entire left hemisphere.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion involving gray matter in
this region. In addition there is severe  diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
