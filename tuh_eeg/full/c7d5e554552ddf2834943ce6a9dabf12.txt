History:	20 year old man found unresponsive.  Patient's current neurological exam
demonstrates absence of all brainstem reflexes.  This is a follow-up EEG.
Medications:	N/A
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate
amplitude theta and delta activity.  There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the left.
Prominent ventilator artifact is seen for a large portion of the recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no clear reactivity to visual,
auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up to 140 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
No reactivity
Other, prominent ventilator artifact
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 23-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing; focal
left hemispheric slowing and lack of clear background reactivity. This finding is indicative of
moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous
focal slowing over the left is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  When compared to
the prior recordings from 1/19/2015 and 1/20/2015, the degree of diffuse slowing is less but lack of
clear reactivity persists.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
