History:	66 YR FEMALE WITH NEW ONSET SZ 10/14.  FOUND ON PORCH LOC/ SHAKING.
2 SZS.  SISTER WITH PMHX OF SZS.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a (low amplitude) 10uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric <10uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta
activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
