CLINICAL HISTORY:  84 year old right handed woman with Parkinson disease, admitted to the neurology service with ambulatory dysfunction and TIA-like symptoms.  Concerns now about a possible seizure on the 18th.

MEDICATIONS:  Sinemet, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Miralax, Tolterodine, Verapamil, ASA, Hydralazine, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient drops in and out of sleep and demonstrates snore artifact.  Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is acceptably organized for age with a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  As she transitions in and out of sleep there are bursts of slowing, vertex waves, spindles and POSTS.  Snore arousals were observed.  Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting in and out of stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR:    50 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for an adult of this age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The snore artifact may suggest an underlying sleep disturbance.  The bradycardia may contribute to the symptoms reported in the history provided.
