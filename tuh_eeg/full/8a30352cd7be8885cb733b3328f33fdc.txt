CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 22-year-old woman, status post delivery of an infant 8 days ago with epidural anesthesia.  Two days ago, she developed a headache of increase in severity.  Possible seizure earlier this morning.
MEDICATIONS:  Valproate, Fioricet, morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically challenging bedside record in an uncomfortable individual with a hair weave.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern and a glimpse of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Shifting slowing was noted.  Bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing were noted as the patient becomes drowsy.
There is a brief section where the patient appears to transition briefly to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and then an arousal.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific, but support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Although this is a sharply contoured record, there are no definitive epileptiform discharges.  These findings should be incorporated into this patient's current clinical scenario.
