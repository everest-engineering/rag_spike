CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 49-year-old gentleman with a 5-minute episode of staring, followed by confusion.  Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD.
MEDICATIONS: Advair, Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: A 26-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  Notation is made for what appears to be a slight error and had a measurement in the frontal electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is 9.6 hertz, 40 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  POSTS were noted in stage 1 sleep and very brief stage 2 sleep included K complexes and vertex waves.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing in the background. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study or study capturing one of the patient's staring spells is suggested.
