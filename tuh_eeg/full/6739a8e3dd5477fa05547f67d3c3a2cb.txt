STUDY DATE:  08/15/2013.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Stroke.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old man with right hemiparesis and a left MCA CVA with a past medical history of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Remeron, Claritin, insulin, heparin, Lipitor, Marinol, aspirin, and diltiazem.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1 and stage II.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Slow waves seen frequently at T3 and F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
