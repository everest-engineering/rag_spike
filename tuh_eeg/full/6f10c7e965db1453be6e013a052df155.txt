CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy, for pre-surgical evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  This section of the record follows a 3:00 a.m. seizure on the morning of the 28th.  The technical quality is relatively satisfactory until the early morning hours of the 29th.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness and sleep:  In wakefulness, there is a well formed 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Intermittently in wakefulness, there is excess background theta.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Brief slow wave sleep was identified.
EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES:  None identified.
ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES:  Not identified.
HEART RATE:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This final, 24-hour section of the EEG monitoring was remarkable for intermittent excess theta.
The overall EEG monitoring report was remarkable for:
The relative absence of epileptiform discharges.
A single seizure out of the left hemisphere at 3:30 a.m. on the morning of the 28th.
