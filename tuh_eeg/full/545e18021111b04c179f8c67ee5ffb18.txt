History:	67 YR FEMALE  WITH 2 FALLS, FOUND UNRESP WITH EMESIS/URINE INCONT.
DOESNT REMEMBER. PT COMPLAINT OF BACK PAIN AND CHEST PAIN.
PMHX: CHF, COPD, HTN, DM, PAD S/P B/L FEM STENTS,
Medications:	Clonidine, Zoloft, Spiriva, Oxycodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Limited symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout
the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid-temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 54 irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse, excessive theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  In addition,  there is mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
