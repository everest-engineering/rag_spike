History:	39 year old woman with a history of seizures since childhood.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Phenytoin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by 11.5-12 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.  There is amplitude asymmetry of the PRD with higher voltage PDR over the
right (>50% difference).  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Asymmetry, alpha, higher voltages of PRD on the R (>50% difference).
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to greater that 50% voltage
asymmetry of the posterior dominant rhythm with higher voltages over the right.  This finding is
suggestive of structural differences over the posterior quadrants.  No epileptiform discharges are
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
