CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old female with complaints of drug overdose with doxepin and opiates as well as benzo, now having jerky movements and has a right frontal lobe infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Lorazepam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  A lot of movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at times seems to reach about 7 Hz.  At times it also appears to be reactive to eye opening.  Overriding the majority of the slow frequencies, there is a prominent beta seen diffusely, but mainly in the frontocentral regions.  This beta is almost continuous.  The patient does not appear to reach sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal slowing seen at T3 intermittently at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts with a frequency of 2-4 Hz.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Some left midtemporal slowing and excess beta seen diffusely.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The excessive beta seen throughout the recording may be seen as an effect of the use of benzodiazepines and/or barbiturates. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
