CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old right-handed woman for EEG monitoring with recurrent episodes of olfactory disturbance or bitter taste in her mouth, history of migraine, seizure medications on hold.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate and Keppra on hold
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  This was a technically acceptable 24-hour recording.
EVENTS: During the EEG monitoring session, the patient had 19 push button spells for a funny taste or smell.  These included 7:41, 8:04, 9:25, 9:33, 10:16, 10:30, 10:37, 11:11, 11:32, 11:44, 1:11, 3:05, 3:54, 6:59, 8:50, 10:09, 11:03, 3:05, and 7 p.m.  The EEG demonstrated a normal pattern with a heart rate of a 70-80 bpm.
INTERICTAL EEG:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient has somewhat disrupted sleep, but did get to sleep a little earlier on the night of the 17th.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with POSTS noted in stage 1 sleep.  Brief stage 2 sleep includes spindles and K complexes.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: NONE
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 2nd day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Normal awake and a sleep record, although there was limited sleep.
Nineteen push button events without EEG change  on the final day of recording
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No evidence of epilepsy was found.  These findings were discussed with the patient and a diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures was reviewed with the patient, which she understood at the conclusion of her EEG monitoring.
