CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed male with cocaine and alcohol dependence. Two seizures characterized by an intensive rush like sensation in his head as if he was lightheaded followed by tonic-clonic activity. Family history positive for epilepsy and seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity and scant theta. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing with vertex waves and POSTS identified in stage I sleep. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Minimal excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. The mild excess theta described above may be part of this patient's postictal state. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study is suggested.
