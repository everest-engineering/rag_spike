CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old male status post mid brain hemorrhage in April 2010, with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bilateral deep brain filter for parkinsonian-like features, neurogenic bladder now with tremor and involuntary movements.

MEDICATIONS: Bethanechol, Lopressor, Sinemet, Keppra, Tegretol, Labetalol, Hydralazine, Ancef. Lovenox, Sinemet, Levetiracetam, Zofran

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake and is intubated. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The waking EEG is remarkable for a slow pattern. The frontocentral regions are much slower and there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm, right greater than left, of approximately 9 Hz. Bursts of FIRDA are noted and there are some notched frontal sharp waves. Five Hz tremor occurs and is not associated with epileptiform activity. There is prominent eye artifact noted.

HR: 108 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slowing most prominent in the frontal regions.
2. Asymmetry with slower activity on the left.
3. FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient had some twitching and other tremor movements noted. These were not associated with epileptiform activity. This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing one of the behaviors may be helpful but the behavior described captured above was not associated with epileptiform activity.
