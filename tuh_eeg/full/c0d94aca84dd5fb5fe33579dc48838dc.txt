CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old make, encephalopathy, alcohol abuse and hepatitis.

MEDICATIONS: Folate Acid

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 19-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated, but awake.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern.
Although there is some muscle-artifact, underneath the muscle there is a mixture of theta and delta. This is a challenging EEG, but triphasic waves are noted in the frontal regions and can be differentiated from eye movement. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is more of a pattern of delta with a delta pattern in sleep and in spontaneous arousals. As the patient drowsed off to sleep, there are occasional, generalized attenuations in the background.

HR: 104 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to

1. Marked background slowing.
2. Triphasic waves.
3. Intermittent attenuations.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The triphasic waves are characteristic of a metabolic encephalopathy, which can include renal or hepatic as well as other processes. The significant background slowing and intermittent attenuation are nonspecific features and can be seen in a severe, diffuse disorder of cerebral function due to many different causes. No seizures were recorded.
