History:	44 YR OLD FEMALE WITH PMHX SIG FOR LUPUS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, SZS. PRESENTS NOW WITH SYNCOPAL EPISODE AT HOME. R/R CLD ON 10/27 PT NOTED WITH SZ ACTIVITY, FOUND UNRESPONSIVE WITH LT GAZE DEV. LOADED W/DILANTIN.
Medications:	DILANTIN, KEPPRA, ZOLOFT, PREDNISONE, PROTONIX, LORAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description: Alpha rhythm and background activity are low voltage (10-25uV), but show normal reactivity to eye opening and attenuate with drowsiness.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
