CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old male with a complaint of migraine/cluster headache on right side. Past medical history for hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Topiramate, Atenolol, Cyclobenzaprine, Diovan,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background demonstrated low voltage and a
drowsy pattern. There was minimal driving with photic stimulation. In wakefulness there is a 9.8 Hz alpha. Hyperventilation increases the amplitude.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was seen in this EEG. This was a normal study. Absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude diagnosis of epilepsy.
