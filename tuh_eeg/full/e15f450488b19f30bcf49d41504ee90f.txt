History:	57 YR MALE FOUND BY FRIEND PASSING OUT WITH GEN SHAKING WITH
URINARY INCONTINENCE.  PMHX: HTN, HLD, SCHIZOPHRENIA, CVA 12/29/14.  CT
CHRONIC  B/L INF
Medications:	DILANTIN, LOVENOX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the
left hemisphere region with associated attenuation during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right midtemporal region
and attenuation in the left hemisphere.  This findings are indicative of a focal structural lesion in
these regions which is consistent with his known strokes. In addition there  diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
