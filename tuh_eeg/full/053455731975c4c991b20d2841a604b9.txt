CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old man with history of seizures since age 18 had one last night lasting 15-18 seconds and could not describe the seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Keppra, phenobarbital, Zonegran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7.5 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontal central beta.
Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slowing seen over the left hemisphere maximal at T3 frequently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Generalized slow waves seen at 5-7 Hz continuously throughout the recording during wakefulness and sleep.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate is 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal focal slowing, as well as mild to moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
