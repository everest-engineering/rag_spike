History:	64 YO FEMALE TRANSFER FROM EPED 5/29 FOR SUDDEN ONSET NECK, BACK PAIN. PT HAD CTN, CT, C-SPIN AT EPED, AFTERWARDS FAMILY NOTICED PT NOT TALKING OR MOVING. TRANSFER TO TUH FOR NEURO EVAL. PT HAS INTERMITTENT LIP SMACKING.
Medications: Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes


Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. There is intermittent runs of frontally-predominant delta activity with triphasic configuration lasting 2-4 seconds on the right side with no evolution. No normal sleep architecture was present.

No epileptiform discharges were present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There were spontaneous variability and stimulation reactivity. HR is 100.

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right midline frontal Diffuse slowing, polymorphic

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Intermittent runs of frontally-predominant delta activity on the right side could be indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region. Clinical correlation is recommended.
