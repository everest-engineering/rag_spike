History: 39 YO MALE LEFT HANDED.SEEING A PSYC. FOR HALLUCINATIONS  WITH AUDITORY VISUAL DISTURBANCE. PMHX., BIPOLAR DISORDER,INSOMNIA, AND SOCIAL ANXIETY.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
