History:	61 year old woman who is unresponsive, was observed to have episodes of eye
deviation.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
The background consists of moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity that is poorly modulated and
reactive.  There is weak AP gradient.  Diffuse excessive polymorphic theta and delta activity are
noted.  No normal sleep architecture is noted but during periods of quiescence, there is diffuse
decrease in amplitudes and increase in the degree of delta activity.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 22 minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-to-moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~120 bpm.
