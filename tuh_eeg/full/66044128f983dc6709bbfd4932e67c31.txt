History:	42 year old man with a history of aneurysmal coiling, now presents with recurrent
seizures.
Medications:	dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta and theta activity is present in the right mid-temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the right mid-temporal region and produces mild diffuse slowing.  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid, mild-to-moderate
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to intermittent mild-to-moderate focal
slowing in the right mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
