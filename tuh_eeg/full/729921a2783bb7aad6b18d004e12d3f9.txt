CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed woman who developed epilepsy at age 39, has symptoms of an aura of lightheadedness, followed by loss of consciousness, stiffening, and postictal confusion.  Seizure free until 2 weeks ago when she had a break through seizure.  Past history of TIA or a small stroke with residual right hemiparesis and impaired memory.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Zoloft, Xanax, Ambien

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation was not performed. Sleep was not achieved.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy of stroke.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study capturing sleep is suggested.
