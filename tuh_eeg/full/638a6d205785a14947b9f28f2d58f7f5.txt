CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old woman with gastroparesis and acute onset of nystagmus, double vision, lightheadedness now with an apraxia and ataxia.

MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Nystatin, ASA, Meclizine, Percocet, Protonix

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a very challenging bedside record due to persistent movement. There is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. The patient seems to be having titubation of the head and also some snorting activity as she drifts off to sleep.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed, but the patient seems to be having some involuntary movements during the EEG which preclude a good quality EEG.
