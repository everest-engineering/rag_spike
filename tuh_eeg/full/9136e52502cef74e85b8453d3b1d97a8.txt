History:	73 year old woman with a reported seizure.
Medications:	Famotidine, Lovenox, Colace, Solu-Medrol, Gabapentin,Miralax, Insulin, Mucomyst
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 7.5 Hz maximally.  The anterior to posterior frequency-
amplitude gradient is weak.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 7-.57Hz activity with
occasional intrusions of polymorphic delta activity.  During brief drowsiness, the degree of diffuse
theta activity increases.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse slowing.  This finding
indicates mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically non-specific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.
