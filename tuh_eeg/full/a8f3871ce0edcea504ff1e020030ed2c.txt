CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old woman with schizophrenia, recent evaluation for urosepsis, and lithium toxicity, now with ongoing oral facial dyskinesias and language impairment.

MEDICATIONS: Haldol, Simvastatin, Lithium, Metformin, Cogentin, Lisinopril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a dynamic pattern with some sections relatively well organized with an 8.3 Hz posterior dominant rhythm but much of the record with more sustained, slower and more disorganized pattern with an alpha rhythm of 7 to 7.5 Hz. Frequent eye flutters noted. Photic stimulation does not active the record.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
2. Relatively sustained more paroxysmal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific but can be see in lithium toxicity, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. A follow-up study may be valuable if this is thought to be a transient disturbance.
