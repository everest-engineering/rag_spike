CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old female with hepatitis C, obesity, recent suicide attempt, now admitted with obtundation and markedly elevated serum ammonia level.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Levothyroxine, Celexa, Haldol, Naprosyn, Methadone,
Seroquel
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and comatose with occasional posturing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, continuous monomorphic slow delta pattern with intermittent bursts of FIRDA. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow featureless pattern.
2. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a severe underlying encephalopathy. There are no epileptiform findings. These findings may be correlated with the severity of her metabolic disturbances and cerebral edema.
