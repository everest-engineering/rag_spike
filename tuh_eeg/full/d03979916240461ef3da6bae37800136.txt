History:	28 Y.O S/P  PEA code , has diffuse cerebral edema on CT head.
Medications:	No sedation
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of burst suppression with variable
interburst intervals lasting 5 seconds up to 60 seconds.  Burst lasts approximately 1-1.5 seconds.
Bursts consist of polymorphic moderate to high amplitude delta activity that is somewhat
stereotyped. Early in the recording several bursts contain generalized frontally predominant sharp
waves.  Additionally, faint very low amplitude EMG artifact is noted in a single EKG lead.  No
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no reactivity to visual,
auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of 120 beats/Min
with intermittent abnormal QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, Variable interburst interval of 5-60 seconds.
Other, EMG artifact in EKG lead with each burst.
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This a very abnormal 21 Minute portable EEG due to a variable degree of burst suppression and
lack of background reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  In a patient with post anoxic brain injury, this pattern indicates poor
chance of full neurological recovery.  Of note, even though not observed, each burst is associated
with subtle movement that is seen in the EKG lead.  These findings were conveyed to the
