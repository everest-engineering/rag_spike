History:	68 YO MALE SYNCOPE VS SEIZURE IN THE AM. CHART WITH LIMITED
INFORMATION PT CLAIMS "FALL OUT OF TOP BUNK, WENT TO BATHROOM,
REMEMBERS NOTHING AFTERWARDS"    PMHX.AIDS,CANCER
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, MIRTAZAPINE, ACYCLOVIR, HEPARIN, AMPICILLIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases
during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse, Excess theta in wakefulness
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
