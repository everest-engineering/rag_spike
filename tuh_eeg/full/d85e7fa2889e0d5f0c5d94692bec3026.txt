DX. EPILEPSY AGE 14, WENT TO ED 2:OO AM. SEIZURE, LEFT  AT 6:00AM,
RETURNED TO ED APPROX. 1 TO 1:30  HAD ANOTHER SEIZURE. CAME TO
EEG.
Medications:	ZONISAMIDE, PAROXETINE,CETIRIZINE, DOCUSATE SODIUM, ED GAVE PT
KEPPRA PER PT.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by poorly-formed 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and diffuse high-voltage
sharply contoured delta bursts, most pronounced in left parasagittal region, were noted.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  HR is 65 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, poorly-formed PDR
Focal slowing, rhythmic, left midline parietal, with drowsiness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent bursts of diffuse high-voltage
sharply contoured delta activity, most pronounced in left parasagittal region during drowsiness and
poorly-formed anterior posterior gradient during wakefulness.  These findings are indicative of 1)
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction; 2) left hemispheric dysfunction. These are etiologically
nonspecific  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
present.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
