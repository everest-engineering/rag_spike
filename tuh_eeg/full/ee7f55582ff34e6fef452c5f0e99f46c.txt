CLINICAL HISTORY:   50 year old right handed woman with history of right MCA stroke, hypertension, and epilepsy, now presents with an episode of ringing in the ears, followed by left hemibody shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, Procardia, Lopressor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 impedance electrode artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz seen better over the left hemisphere, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta seen. Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen almost continuously over the right hemisphere, maximal at F7/T3 and T3, at times F3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal right hemispheric slowing maximal in the anterior to mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right hemisphere maximum at the anterior and mid temporal regions, which is consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
