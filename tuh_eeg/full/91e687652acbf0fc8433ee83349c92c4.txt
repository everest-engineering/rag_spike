CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 46-year-old gentleman with chronic kidney stones and chronic mental illness and asthma with increasing confusional spells.

MEDICATIONS:  Fibromyalgia and moxifloxacin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a routine, outpatient 20-minute EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.  Technologist had difficult maintaining impedances under 5 kilo-ohms.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient was quite drowsy and in drowsiness, there is slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Maximal wakefulness includes a 12 hertz alpha rhythm in a background, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.

Heart rate 55 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This is a very drowsy adult and clinical correlation may be of value.
