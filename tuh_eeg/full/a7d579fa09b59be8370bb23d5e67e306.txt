CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old female with a history of CHF, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism with a new left parietal bleed.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Insulin, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Lipitor, Cipro.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Bleed and change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were performed including photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8.5 Hz which appears to be mildly reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures of photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient appears to go into drowsiness during the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen independently at F7/T3 and more than F8/T4 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times these slow waves become more monomorphic and rhythmic especially over the left temporal region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral independent anterior temporal slowing in the left more than right.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal independent cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region (left more than right) in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.
However, the left-sided slowing may be due at least in part to the known hemorrhage.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
