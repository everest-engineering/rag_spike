CLINICAL HISTORY:  83 year old male with history of stroke involving the right leg, dementia, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Flomax, Metoprolol, Brinzolamide, Lasix, Latanoprost, Lipitor, ISS, Pantoprazole, Heparin, Morphine, Percocet, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record in an agitated patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow and disorganized.  There is a hint of an alpha rhythm of 6 Hz.  This appears to be better developed on the left compared to the right.  Although this is a challenging EEG overall, the EEG is slower on the right.  There are occasional bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta.  Features of drowsiness and sleep included decrease in muscle artifact and an increase in arrhythmic delta.
HR:    60-90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to,
Background slowing and disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left and a slower alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  No epileptiform features were seen and no seizures were recorded.  The focal features described may be correlated with imaging and history.
