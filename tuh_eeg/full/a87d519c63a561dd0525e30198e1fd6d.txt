History:	88 y/o F c/c chest pain, congestive heart failure, PMHX- afib,dyspnea, lower
extremity adema, HTN, MM, HLD, BPV
Medications:	Heparin, Lasix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and stepped photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84.  There was a
persistent muscle artifact in the frontal leads.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent, mild diffuse
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a limited ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG due to mild  diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
