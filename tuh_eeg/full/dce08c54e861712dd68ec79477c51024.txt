LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Approximately 2 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer who now presents with subacute change in mental status in the setting of fevers.  EEG is performed to rule out clinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and antibiotics.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  A single EKG lead was used, as well.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at lower amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The background consists of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude, mixture of theta and delta activity and abundant triphasic wave forms while the patient is awake.  By the end of the recording, the patient appears asleep; however, no normal sleep architecture is captured.  There are no clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing and voltage attenuation.
Abundant triphasic wave forms.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 2-hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, focal left hemispheric slowing at lower voltages, and abundant triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that is moderate in degree and at least partially related to toxic metabolic disturbances.  Focal slowing an attenuation over the left hemisphere indicates left hemispheric dysfunction that could be structural in etiology.  Triphasic wave forms are seen in nonspecific encephalopathy.  There were no clear electrographic seizures.
