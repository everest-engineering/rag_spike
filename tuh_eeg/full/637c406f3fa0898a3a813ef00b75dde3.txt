CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old right handed male, HHNK 12/2009 with unresponsiveness, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hertz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of background beta and theta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing a small increase in slowing. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess beta.
2. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. Medications are the most common cause for the beta. The theta can be due to a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
