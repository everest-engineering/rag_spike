History:	62 year old man with a history of seizures, alcohol abuse, stroke, encephalopathy.
Medications:	none provided.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude well formed and modulated and
reactive 10.5-12 Hz alpha activity.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
Shifting independent bilateral temporal polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured.  A single
sharp transient is present over the left anterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral (L>R) temporal, shifting slowing;
Sharp transients, one, left temporal, anterior
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22 minute EEG due to independent bilateral shifting moderate
temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The presence of a single left anterior temporal sharp
transient is of uncertain clinical significance.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
