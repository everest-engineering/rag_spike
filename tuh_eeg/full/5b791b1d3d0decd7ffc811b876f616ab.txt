History:	52 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND DOWN IN FIELD W/
ASYSTOLE. PT HAD C/C OF WORSENING ASTHMA, WALKED UP A FLIGHT OF
STAIRS COMPLAINED OF BREATHING THEN COLLAPSED.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PROPOFOL DRIP, 5 MG OF VEC
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 22 hours from12/23/2014 to 12/24/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by generalized
(frontally-maximal) periodic (1 to 2 Hz) epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) with at times some
intermixed delta and theta diffuse slowing. Along with GPEDs the patient had associated eye
movements.  The background becomes progressively attenuated over the first hours of the record.
For the last 17 hours the background is almost completely attenuated with intermittent eye
movement artifact noted.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  Generalized periodic discharge, diffuse slowing with
progressive diffuse background attenuation.  The combination of findings are suggestive of  severe
cortical dysfunction.  In the setting of hypoxic injury it forebodes a poor prognosis.
