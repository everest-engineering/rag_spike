CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old woman admitted December 19th, now with VDRF. History of anoxic injury, date unknown. Schizophrenia. Gastric bypass surgery. Prior hypoxic insult, October of 2009.

MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl, Seroquel, Lorazepam, Haldol, Gabapentin, Dopamine, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is markedly abnormal. It includes a mixed frequency pattern, rich in frontal delta, occipital beta, and central alpha and theta. Stimulation of the patient did not produce a change in the EEG. This EEG could be described as invariant.
Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Absence of reactivity.
3. Absence of variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, chronic encephalopathy.
