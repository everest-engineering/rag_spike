CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old right handed woman with a history of colon and liver cancer status post chemotherapy who presents with Rasmussen encephalitis, presents with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Topamax, Keppra, Depakote.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly slow background EEG with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 8 Hz.  It appears to be reactive to eye opening.  The patient appears to be awake and drowsy during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at C4, at times in rhythmic bursts but not clearly evolving in amplitude or frequency.
Focal slow waves seen at C4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 75 microvolts with an associated breach in this region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central sharp waves.
Continuous focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in the right central region, which is likely related to her craniotomy and autoimmune disease.  Please note that the pattern of rhythmicity does not appear to
evolve, making it clearly consistent with seizures; however, sometimes this pattern may represent continuous electrographic activity and a repeated recording with an Ativan challenge may be helpful in elucidating if this, in fact, is part of its baseline.
