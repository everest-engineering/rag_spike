CLINICAL HISTORY: 	31 year old right handed male with 1 episode of loss of consciousness  2 weeks ago. Â·
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient is awake, however, has many episodes of falling asleep and drowsiness. Patient has hyperventilation and photic stimulation during EEG study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient had a background of 10 Hz alpha and generous low voltage beta. During drowsiness there is evidence of POSTS and vertex wave and also hypersynchronous  rhythmic slowing which is a normal variant. In addition, he has nice lateral rectus spikes with eye movements which is also a normal variant. He has no evidence of sharp waves. Photic stimulation produces a nice driving response, but patient falls asleep, and hyperventilation gives some background beta and theta.
HR:   84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity is noted.
