MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of loss of consciousness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I/stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient goes into stage I/stage II sleep.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation and hyperventilation produce no abnormal discharges.  At times there are nice bursts of rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness seen throughout the recording but no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:    None.
SEIZURES:    None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
