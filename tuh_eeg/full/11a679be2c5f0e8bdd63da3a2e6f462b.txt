ONSET SZ WITH SHAKING AND LOC WITH POSTICTAL CONFUSION IN 6/2015.
DENIES ANY RECENT/NEW EVENTS
Medications:	Can't recall sz meds.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral anterior temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG because of intermittent focal slowing
independently seen in the bilateral anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
