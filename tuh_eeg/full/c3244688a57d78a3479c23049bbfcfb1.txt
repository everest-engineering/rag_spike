CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male with left posterior temporal parietal cavernoma with single seizure. Recent craniotomy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a well organized pattern for an adult of this age with a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm reaching 50 to 70 microvolts. A breach rhythm is identified in the left temporal region, concurrent with a craniotomy and there is some subtle focal slowing. Feature of drowsiness include an increase in generalized background slowing and some focal slowing at F3 and F7. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing in the left hemisphere: anterotemporal and frontocentral.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
