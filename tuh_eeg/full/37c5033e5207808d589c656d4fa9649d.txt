REASON FOR STUDY:  Memory problems and right temporal ICH.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old man with history of stroke in 2000 with left-sided weakness which actually was a right temporal ICH, herniated disk, COPD, depression and memory problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, phenylephrine, Lopressor, lisinopril, oxycodone.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Low amplitude recording with continuous muscle artifact made it difficult to review clearly the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that can be seen at times reaching 9-10 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage 1 and stage 2.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None clearly seen.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that there is an overall very slow low amplitude to this recording with the muscle artifact, it is difficult to make any definite statement of any abnormality.
