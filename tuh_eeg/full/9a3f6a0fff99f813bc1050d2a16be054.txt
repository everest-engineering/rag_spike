History:	76 year woman with altered mental status.
Medications:	no AEDs, tramadol, flecainide, coumadin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal wakefulness, 9-9.5 Hz PDR, expected AP gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic
theta activity are present.  Nearly continuous diffuse overriding monomorphic moderate amplitude
delta activity is present.  Drowsiness is characterized by decrease in EMG artifact.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute portable EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction. This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
