CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old female presents hypertensive emergency with encephalopathy, past history of stroke with right-sided weakness and aphasia.

MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Remeron, Coumadin, Metoprolol, K-Dur, Diltiazem,
Warfarin, Mirtazapine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a medium amplitude background with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta activity. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity is observed and on occasion there is more disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere in comparison to the right. Features of sleep include frontal delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 90 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Poor organization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or post ictal state. No epileptiform features were observed.
