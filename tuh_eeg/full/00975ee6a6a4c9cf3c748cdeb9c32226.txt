History:	25 year old man with acute renal failure and change in mental status.
Medications:	Zosyn, Vancomycin, labetalol and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches polymorphic low amplitude 8-8.5 Hz activity.  The anterior
to posterior frequency-amplitude gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity
is present throughout the recording.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz
rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording.  No normal sleep architecture is
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Improvement in the PRD is seen with
stimulation.  Sinus tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 31-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse background slowing,
disorganization and FIRDA. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-to-
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  FIRDA is seen in various encephalopathies, increased ICP,
bilateral deep white matter lesions.  No electrographic seizures are present.
