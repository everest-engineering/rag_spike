History:	29 year old man found down with jerking and posturing.
Medications:	PROPOFOL,PHENYTOIN,NITROGLYCERIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Some intermittent diffuse attenuation is seen.  Some sleep spindles were noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli. The background improved slightly to a theta frequency for seconds.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Attenuation, intermittent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The spindles and attenuation suggest that this may be due at least in part to
