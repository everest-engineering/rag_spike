CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old firefighter, who experiences seizure on November 2nd.  Fell to ground, syncopal versus seizure episode with postictal combative behavior.  Past history of ETOH dependence.  The patient had been involved in 1 fire the day just before the seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed on lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta and slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited minimal driving.  Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The generous beta may be related to anxiety or medications.
