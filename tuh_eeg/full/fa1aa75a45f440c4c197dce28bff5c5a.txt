History: 69 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF CVA LEFT 9 YRS AGO, PT HAS APHASIA .. PT
DENIES HAVING SZS BUT HAD ABN EEG. PUT ON SZ MEDS. PT NOW EVAL TO STOP MEDS.
Medications: Topiramate, Divalproex. Xanax
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-2 5Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Almost continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior-mid temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. Occasional focal spike-and-wave discharges and sharp waves are present in the left temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7. T3.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1Â·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal
Sharp waves. Occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. frequent epileptiform discharges in the left temporal region. These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus
in this region.
