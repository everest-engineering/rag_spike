CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman who developed epilepsy at age 19, most recent seizure a week ago characterized by shaking, falling, loss of consciousness, incontinence of urine.  Past history of diabetes and asthma.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred because of the patient's asthma.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Minimal drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.

Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.

Heart rate 78 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  To more completely characterize this patient's EEG, a repeat study, perhaps with sleep deprivation and capturing some sleep, or with hyperventilation if this is appropriate may be of value.
