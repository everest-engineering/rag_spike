CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old right handed woman with seizures on December 6, 2011 characterized by focal motor activity on the left with left sided weakness, past history of stroke, now continues to have difficulty with left sided numbness and a feeling as if her left hand or leg is floating around.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tramadol, Neurontin, Lisinopril, ASA, Synthroid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a somewhat slow pattern with an alpha rhythm ranging from 7-8 Hz.  Intermittent focal slowing is noted in the right hemisphere particularly in the central temporal, but sometimes the central occipital regions with disruption of faster frequency activity.  Shifting slowing is noted. Features of drowsiness include an accentuation of focal slowing from the right. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are compatible with a structural process on the right consistent with the previous history of stroke.  No epileptiform features were noted today.
