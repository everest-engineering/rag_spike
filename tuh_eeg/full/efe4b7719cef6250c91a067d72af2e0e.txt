CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 81-year-old male status post knee replacement in February.  The patient had an episode of left arm twitching in February followed by prolonged seizures.  Now with more clonus of the right arm.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, valproic acid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive.  The family had noted seizures on the 8th and 9th.  In later portions of the record the patient was conversant.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern.  With an alerting, there is a bit more low voltage theta and alpha frequency activity noted in the background.  There are rare, broadly contoured, poorly formed sharp transients noted in the right hemisphere.  Features of sleep include an increase in background slowing.  In sleep, there is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more delta noted on the right than the left.  During much of the record the patient is somewhat drowsy and confused with more of a slow, lower voltage delta pattern.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Marked background slowing.
At times a subtle asymmetry with a bit more slowing on the right.
Rare, sharply contoured transients noted from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were noted.  The patient was not noted to have spasticity or tremulousness of the left arm during this EEG.  This EEG was most compatible with a bihemispheric, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
