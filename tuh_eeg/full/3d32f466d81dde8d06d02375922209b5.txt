Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes,  comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient. The background consists of attenuated slow delta activity that is unreactive . Additionally , periodic stereotyped artifact is present throughout the recording. No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
