SOB. CHEST TIGHTEN, LASTED 11/2 MIN. NO HX: SEIZURES
Medications: Losartan, Oxaprozin
Sedation:
EEG Type:
Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10·20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV. 9Hz alpha rhythm. Which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric S.15uV. 1S.25Hz activity Is present maximal over bilateral cranial regions. During brief drowsiness. the alpha rhythm attenuates. and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely. Followed
by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect HR Is 80 bpm
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  Indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
