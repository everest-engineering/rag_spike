CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old left handed woman with history of Meniere's, hypertension, diabetes, CAD who presents with an episode of seizure, which is different from her usual Meniere's.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Glyburide, Lisinopril, Lipitor, Plavix.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Vertigo.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing at T4 seen intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
HR:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent right mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
