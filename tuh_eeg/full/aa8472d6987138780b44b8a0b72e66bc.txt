History:	63 YR OLD WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O TIA'S, 1ST 2000/2001, 2ND 9/2013.
PT'S HX ALONG SIG FOR EPISODE OF APHASIA AND LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE
STROKE 4/10/2015. PT DENIES ANY SZ EVENTS.
Medications:	ATENOLOL, NORTRIPTYLINE, BIOTIN, NAPROXEN, LORATADINE, MULTI-VIT,
PRAVASTATIN, TRAVATAN, OMEPRAZOLE, PLAVIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal  region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
