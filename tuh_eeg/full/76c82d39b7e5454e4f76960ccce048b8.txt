CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old woman with positional dizziness.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Lasix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow at 7.2 to 8.3 Hz. There is occasional shifting arrhythmic delta activity. Some of this is somewhat sharply contoured. Features of stage 1 sleep include vertex waves, followed by sleep spindles in the central regions. The sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. An alpha rhythm of 8.3 Hz is considered outside the range of normal, but in the context of this patient's age should be considered satisfactory.
