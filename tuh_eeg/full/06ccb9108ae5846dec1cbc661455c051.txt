CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed woman with epilepsy for the last 9
years. She has a past history of head injury. Last seizure August 2010. Now the
patient is experiencing headaches and dizziness. She also reported to the technologist
generalized tonic clonic seizures with loss of consciousness, tongue biting. Confusion,
insomnia, incontinence, hypertension, and asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, Singular, Dilantin
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm of 40-50 microvolts. There is generous beta noted in drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude
of the background, as well as some hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Spindles are
noted in stage 2 sleep. The patient transitions readily into between wakefulness and
sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not activate
the record.
HR: 55 bpm and slightly irregular in hyperventilation.
EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL There were no focal nor epileptiform features identified in
this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Additional
recording capturing one of the patient's spells may be of value.
