CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 22-year-old male with epilepsy since age 14.  Seizures began with an aura of numbness in the tongue followed by forced deviation of the head to the left, then tongue biting, and tonic-clonic activity.  The patient has approximately 1 per month, cannot name the date of most recent seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Trileptal, and topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is acceptably organized, but there are some sections in maximal wakefulness when it is not and there is excess theta.  There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which was sometimes disrupted on the left.  Intermittent rhythmic left temporal theta was noted with TIRDA.  This seems to be augmented high hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response despite the focal features described above.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the left temporal slowing.  Brief stage I and stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles.
In addition to the epileptiform activity identified on the left, there is a single right rhythmic sharp wave
Heart rate:  55 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Underlying left temporal sharp waves.
A single right temporal sharp wave was noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG demonstrates a bihemispheric process given the background disorganization.  The predominant activity is on the left including rhythmic slowing on the left and the vast majority of epileptiform activity is on the left.  This EEG baseline will be used for this patient's long-term monitoring session.
