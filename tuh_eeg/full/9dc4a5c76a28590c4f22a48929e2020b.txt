History:	83 year old man who presented with shaking episodes.  Left parietal meningioma
was found.  Patient also has a history of metastasis cancer, unknown if brain
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal the background consists of low amplitude diffuse beta activity without clear
PDR or AP gradient.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  Sleep
spindles are captured.
Continuous independent right anterior and right posterior rhythmic broadly based sharp waves are
captured (PLEDs).  They occur at the repetition rate of ~ 0.75-1 Hz.  Maximal scalp negativity is
over F8/T2 and O2/P4 leads, respectfully.  Right posterior sharp waves are frequently accompanied
by low amplitude polyspikes.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, right, independent frontal and
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 23 minute EEG due to continuous moderate right
hemispheric focal slowing and independent 0.75-1 Hz right anterior and right posterior rhythmic
epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). These findings indicate focal structural abnormality over the right
with increases epileptogenic potential in the right anterior and right posterior regions.  Please
correlate clinically.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Patient was placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
