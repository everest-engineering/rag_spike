History:	42 year old man with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Neurontin, Pantoprazole, Zocor, Zyprexa, Flomax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the entire recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  There is
nearly continuous eye blink artifact.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, eye movement, eye blinking
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 30-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. There is nearly continuous eye blink artifact.
