CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old gentleman with no history of seizures in the past coming in with shortness of breath worsening for one week and abdominal distention for one month. Patient had an episode of 5 minutes of unresponsiveness while hugging the nurse on the bedside with mild confusion after the event. Patient's past medical history is significant for CAD status post CABG, end stage liver disease. liver cirrhosis, hypertension, and  hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION : Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system electrode placement system with one anterior temporal electrode and EKG electrode. Wakefulness and drowsiness was recorded. Photic stimulation was performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a slow background in theta frequency at 6-7 Hz with the amplitude of 10-15 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. There was a small amount of frontocentral beta on both sides. Drowsiness was characterized by the burst of theta at 5-6 Hz on both hemispheres. Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Excessive bilateral theta on the backgrounds. Asynchronous delta frequencies at 1-2 Hz on both sides but more prominent in the right occipital than the left occipital.

SEIZURES: None.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excessive slowing on the background.
2. Asynchronous delta frequency on the right occipital more than the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION ION: This EEG showed excessive slowing in the background frequency at 1-2 Hz on the right occipital more than the left which, given the technical interpret. This EEG did not show any epileptiform discharges. Please note that no epileptiform discharges do not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Repeating the EEG in the lab when possible is suggested.
