CLINICAL HISTORY:   20 year old man with a history of seizures since approximately 8 years of ago who now presents with reported 3 generalized tonic-clonic convulsions without tongue biting, urinary incontinence or postictal muscle aches.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of a single EKG electrode. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient was asleep throughout the majority of the recording.  During very brief maximal wakefulness, there is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Most of the awake background consists of low to moderate amplitude, pleomorphic theta and delta mixed with sleep spindle-like patterns.  During sleep, vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  No epileptiform discharges are observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Intrusions of sleep into wakefulness.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to:
1.  Moderate diffuse slowing and intrusions of wakefulness into sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   These findings indicate nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  In this patient, this could be attributed to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
