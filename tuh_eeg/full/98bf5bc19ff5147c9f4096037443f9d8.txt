REASON FOR STUDY: Rule out possible nocturnal seizures.
INTRODUCTION: This is a routine EEG was done under 10-20 electrode placement and EKG artifact as well as anterior temporal electrode. Sleep stage I was captured and photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
MEDICATIONS: Include Procardia, Singulair, Colace, Topamax 25 mg, Lipitor, ferrous sulfate, hydrochlorothiazide, Lexapro, calcium carbonate, Zantac, Duramist, Mirapex, Prozac, Advair, Proventil, aspirin, senna, Ambien, and Cozaar.
HISTORY: A 63-year-old woman with seizure onset about five years ago states that she has seizures at night with tongue biting, but no bowel or bladder incontinence. She states seizures are occurring twice per week.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: Opens to a well formed 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm at 20 to 75 microvolts, which is symmetric to wide opening. There is a small amount of frontal beta at 15 to 25 Hz and 10 to 25 microvolts amplitude. Sleep is characterized by stage I during photic stimulation. No abnormal discharges were seen. During the recording, there was one sharp transient seen at C3-F3 during stage I sleep followed by a subtle head movement of the head with muscle artifact seen in the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: None
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG, awake and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This awake and sleep EEG was normal. Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures remain a clinical concern, prolonged recording will aid in obtaining epileptiform abnormalities.
