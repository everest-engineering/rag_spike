CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old  with massive MCA aneurysmal hemorrhage, status post coil, status post embolization a year ago.  Now admitted for confusion.  Associated symptoms include vertigo, left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Percocet, Gabapentin, HCTZ, Metoprolol, Baclofen
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is disorganized.  There is an asymmetry with excess theta noted on the right compared to the left.  There are a handful of T4 sharp waves noted in the context of what is breach rhythm.  Generous beta is noted bilaterally.  This bedside EEG is remarkable for a fair amount of muscle artifact.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Theta noted most prominently in the right central region.
Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were noted.  The background slowing and disorganization may be correlated with imaging.  The focal slowing on the right and the rare sharp waves are congruent with her history.
