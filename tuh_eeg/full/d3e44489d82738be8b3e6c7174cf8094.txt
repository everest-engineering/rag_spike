History:	29 YO WOMAN WITH NO PREVIOUS HX OF SEIZURE, FELL AT WORK
PREVIOUS DAY. PT CLAIMS TO HEAR EMT TALKING TO HER BUT SHE COULD
NOT RESPOND. SPEECH RETURNED SLOWLY, BASELINE 15 MIN IN ED, CT
NEGATIVE. PMHX: HYPOTHYROID. PSHX:: UNCLE AND COUSIN WITH
Medications:	ORTHOTRICYCLINE, SYNTHROID
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 9Hz posterior dominant rhythm with admixed beta activity,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive diffuse symmetric 5-25uV, 18-25Hz
beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, beta
activity becomes more prominent, and symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a minimal symmetric photic
driving response.  HR is 72.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excess beta activity is a nonspecific finding
and may be an effect of medications.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
