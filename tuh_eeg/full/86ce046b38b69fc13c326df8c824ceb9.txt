CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old woman, presented on the morning of the 5th, found unresponsive, in cardiac arrest with fixed and dilated pupils, now for hypothermic treatment.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, metronidazole, Demerol, propofol, neuromuscular blocking agent, propofol 13.7 mL/h, aztreonam, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  During the course of the EEG, shiver artifact was noted, and briefly, a neuromuscular blocking agent was utilized.  No clinical seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The early hours of this EEG, on the afternoon of October 5th, demonstrate a low voltage relatively featureless pattern with muscle and shiver artifacts.  The utilization of a neuromuscular blocking agent around midnight on the evening of the 5th, demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with an overall suppressed pattern.  The burst suppression pattern is somewhat variable.  At times, the only activity is slow periodic delta and other times, there are brief bursts of delta followed by theta lasting 1-3 seconds.  In this section of the record, it is not possible to determine if there was tactile stimulation or other stimulation.
EEG monitoring continues on the morning of the 6th.  There is less on the way of muscle, low eye movements and other slow  delta waveforms, which may represent  low voltage cerebral activity were noted.  There is also a small amount of theta.
Heart rate 114 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This initial day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Overall suppressed brain pattern.
Burst suppression pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were noted.  Additional EEG recording will be performed for this adult who was re-warmed by the morning of October 6, but remained on a propofol drip
