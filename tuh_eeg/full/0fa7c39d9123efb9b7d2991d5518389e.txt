DATE OF STUDY:  August 21, 2014 to August 22, 2014.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult-onset refractory epilepsy and multiple medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  This section of EEG includes August 21st to 22nd.  It is continuous video EEG monitoring with seizure and spike detection.  The patient, computer, and clinical team did not identified any clinical or electrographic seizures during this section of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Intermittent bursts of somewhat irregular slowing were noted.  Wicket was noted in the transition to drowsiness.
Rare discrete sharp waves were noted independently from the right or left temporal region.  These occurred primarily in drowsiness.  In contrast to the initial sections of the EEG, these were less common, more subtle, and were a little bit more likely to be seen in the left.  There was wicket activity, but there are other wave forms that have more clear disruption of faster frequency activity.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No electrographic seizures were recorded.  The interictal epileptiform discharges suggest a focal mechanism for seizures.  The bilateral bursts of slowing may be an interictal phenomenon for this individual or may be related to the patient's other complex medical issues.
