History:	PT PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ AS A CHILD, SZ ARE W/ LOC, BLADDER INCONT
AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  During sleep small sharp spikes can be seen.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region, which is
consistent with the know temporal lobectomy.
