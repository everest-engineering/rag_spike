CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old woman with profound psychiatric pathology.  The patient began to have episodes this past summer with body tremulousness of which she is aware.  She feels anxious, fearful and exhausted afterwards.  She can feel her body trembling.  The patient experienced one of her events during this EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient had one of her spells during the EEG, during hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm, a small amount of low voltage frontal central theta activity.  Hyperventilation produced one of the patient's spells.  She was crying, occasionally smiling and trembling.  The EEG pattern during this event was characterized by a normal awake pattern with occasional head rocking artifact.
The patient remained tearful after the event and did not go to sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  Heart rate 60-84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalography in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The video documents an event that would be extremely unlikely to be a seizure with clear interactivity and voluntary movements throughout the behavior.  In addition, there were no epileptiform features noted.  This EEG is most suggestive of a non-epileptic or emotionally linked seizure.
