History:	41 year old male with GSW to the head (left frontal region) on l 2-15-13. He had his
first GTC seizure on 11/23/13 while sleeping.
Medications:	Keppra, Neurontin, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Subtle left anterior polymorphic delta activity is occasionally observed, more pronounced during
sleep.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse slowing,
up to delta frequency range, more so over the left anterior quadrant.  Stepped photic stimulation
from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left anterior, mild-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to subtle occasional mild-to-
moderate left anterior slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
