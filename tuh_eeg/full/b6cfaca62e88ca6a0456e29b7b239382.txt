CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old woman with renal failure, hypertension, diabetes,
past PEA code, obstructive sleep apnea, a TIA with a fall with resolving temporal
parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Renal Caps, Cozaar, Nifedipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. It
is also a dynamic pattern with primarily a delta-theta pattern but some sections of the
record with more delta, others with a bit more theta. There are two well-defined high
amplitude sharp waves in the left mid upper region and a single right temporal sharp
wave. In addition, there are rare sections of the record with a bit more arrhythmic delta
activity identified in the right hemisphere compared to the left.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Rare sharp waves which seem primarily on the left.
3. Focal slowing on the right.'
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. The sharp waves are more
prominent contralateral to the subarachnoid hemorrhage. If appropriate, please
consider a follow-up EEG.
