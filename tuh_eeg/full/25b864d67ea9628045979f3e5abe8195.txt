CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed male with epilepsy. Left.sided stroke
with encephalomalacia and now bilateral strokes.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10Â·20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has received 5 mg
Ativan and is quite somnolent. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very slow
pattern, low voltage with delta and smaller amounts of beta. There is intermittent
background attenuation. There are a handful of low voltage, right frontotemporal sharp
waves as well as rare sharp waves noted on the left which can be differentiated from
EKG and other artifacts. The patient's transitioning into stage II sleep during photic
stimulation which does not otherwise activate the record.
HR: 90bpm .
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with low voltage slow pattern.
2. A handful of proudly contoured sharp waves in the right anterior temporal or
frontocentral region.
3. Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This-record is significantly slower and lower voltage than
previous studies. In the 2 previous studies available for comparison, the epileptiform
activity was higher amplitude and more easily defined on the right.
