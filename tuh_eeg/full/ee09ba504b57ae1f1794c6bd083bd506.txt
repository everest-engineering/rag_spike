Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Some state changes were noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
