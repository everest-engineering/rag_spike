CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed woman with history of episodes of loss of consciousness, some with quick return to baseline and some with confusion after the episodes and previous to the episodes having a strange smell.  The patient is 6 months pregnant.  She also has a history of open heart surgery in the past.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal Vitamins, Folic Acid.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of loss of consciousness and confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activity and procedures included photic stimulation, which revealed no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded mainly in wakefulness and some drowsiness.  However, no clear stage I or stage II was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Single focal slowing noted at F8/T4 with sharp contour preceding it in the frontal region, which appeared suspicious; however, no clearly pathologic.
SEIZURES:  None.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG revealed evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please note that the sharp contour to the discharge appears somewhat suspicion and prolonged recording with deeper stages of sleep is recommended.
