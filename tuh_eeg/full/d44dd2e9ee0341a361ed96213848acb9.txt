CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old male with posttraumatic epilepsy since 2003.  Seizures characterized by sweatiness, headache, loss of consciousness, tonic-clonic activity and postictal confusion. The patient states that he has been seizure-free since starting levetiracetam. Recent incarceration.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a routine 20-minute capturing wakefulness and sleep.  Impedances are acceptable aside from the T1-T2 electrodes which are slightly above 5 km.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with vertex waves noted in stage I sleep.  Spindles and snore arousals were noted in sleep.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous bilateral driving response.
Heart rate: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The overall EEG is well organized.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be considered.
