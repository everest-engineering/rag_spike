CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right-handed woman with epilepsy since age 13,
seizure free for years, with recurrent seizures for the last 5 months with staring. Patient walks around and is confused. Also history of tonic clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10á20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm with a slow amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation
is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude as the
background and some paroxysmal slowing. Features of drowsiness include hypnagogic
hypersynchrony. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation
produces a subharmonic paroxysmal burst as the patient drifts off to sleep. She Is
falling off to sleep during photic stimulation.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified. The
findings described above are all normal findings.
