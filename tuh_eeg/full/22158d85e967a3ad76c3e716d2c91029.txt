REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 61-year-old man presents with history of alcohol withdrawal seizures as well as multiple seizures in the shelter, here for follow up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, phenobarbital, folic acid, thiamine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at best 8 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges: Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz.  Amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Seizures: None.
Heart rate: 90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
