CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed with episodes of electric shock sensations from back of the head, followed by blurry vision. These symptoms have been present for 3 years and last occurred 2 weeks.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well organized
background with generous 12 Hz activity in the background. The alpha rhythm is 11.5 Hz. There is a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta with rhythmic central theta. There were rare vertex waves in stage 1 sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are a number of normal variants in the EEG, including rhythmic central theta of drowsiness and prominent 12 Hz activity, but there are no epileptiform features observed.
