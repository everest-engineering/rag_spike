CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed woman with complex partial epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Ability, Alendronate, Advair, Singulair, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is slightly slow with an 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There are a handful of suspicious sharp waves which resemble wicket on the left. In addition there is a subtle asymmetry with slightly slower activity on the left compared to the right.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild generalized slowing.
2. Slightly slower pattern on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Well defined epileptiform was not identified,
although there was 1 suspicious sharp wave. Additional EEG either with
sleep deprivation or more prolonged sleep may be helpful to sharp waves.
