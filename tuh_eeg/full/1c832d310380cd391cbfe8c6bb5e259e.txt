CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 29-year-old woman admitted to Frankford Hospital for a syncopal episode versus migraine headache versus panic attack.  The patient fell on March 8 and had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.  Past history of epilepsy at age 16, increasingly frequent migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorcet, Motrin and Zofran.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. For a young adult of this age, there is a small degree of background slowing and disorganization as well as some theta.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are shifting, sharply contoured slowing in the right or left temporal region.  Some of this includes broadly contoured, sharply contoured delta.  There is also some more sharply contoured high amplitude theta noted in the right frontotemporal region.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation produced driving at faster flash frequencies.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background as well as rhythmic slowing.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
A small degree of background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing in sleep, some of which is sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with this patient's past history of childhood epilepsy.  No definitive spikes or seizures were noted in this EEG but to more completely characterize this patient's epileptiform pattern, a more prolonged study capturing more deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
