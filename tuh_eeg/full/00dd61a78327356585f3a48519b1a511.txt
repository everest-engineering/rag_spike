AGE: 24 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/10/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT:  Inpatient 778A EEG TYPE: 95819
EEG #: 15-1328
HISTORY:
24 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for recurrent seizures- 1 SZ IN HIGH SCHOOL.  THEN HAS MVA ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND THEY CAME BACK
MEDICATIONS:
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit. Vimpat, Ativan? Keppra
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and limited photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a generous amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.  Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. PSWY and Mu (normal findings) were noted
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
No generalized slowing is present.  No focal slowing is present. Posterior head rocking was seen
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION  PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation:did not activate the record Photic Stimulation: did not activate the record
EVENTS:
Intermittent left leg shaking had no EEG correlate.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG. There are no electrographic events detected.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy/asleep routine EEG. The generous beta may be medication effect.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. Consider sleep
EEG when the patient is able to cooperate
