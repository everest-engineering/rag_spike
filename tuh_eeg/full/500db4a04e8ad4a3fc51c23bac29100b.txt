History:	63 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS ON 6/7/14 WITH H/O GEN T/C SZ W/TONGUE
BITING AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION, PT HAD NO RECALL OF EVENT. PRIOR
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The waking background is characterized by a 25-40 uV, 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with some anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
Very frequent, independent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal
regions during wakefulness. At times this becomes somewhat monomorphic and rhythmic.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces marked diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, bilateral temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  very frequent, independent bilateral midtemporal focal
slowing.  These findings are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin. In addition, there is  mild diffuse background slowing,
which is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
