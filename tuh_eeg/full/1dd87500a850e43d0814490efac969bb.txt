History:	65 year old man who presents with change in MS.
Medications:	Protonix, Depacon, Lorazepam, Insulin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with
paucity of faster frequencies over the right.  The background over the left consists of diffuse fast
~12-14 Hz activity with occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity.  The background over the
right consists of a mixture of polymorphic attenuated theta and delta activity with occasional
underriding 12-14 Hz activity.  Focal theta and delta are most pronounced over the lateral leads.
Fragments of sleep spindles and vertex waves are noted, with sleep architecture better formed over
No clear epileptiform discharges are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric, most pronounced over the
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 23-minute EEG due to diffuse background slowing and focal slowing over
the right hemisphere (most pronounced over the temporal region). Diffuse slowing is indicative of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Given the appearance of
the waveforms, slowing is at least partially medication induced.  Continuous focal slowing is
indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right hemisphere.  The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
