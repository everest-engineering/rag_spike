CLINICAL HISTORY:   61 year old woman who presented cardiac arrest with code in progress outside hospital and was brought in for further care, found to have a code and now unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Sodium, Bicarbonate
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during coma.  No activating procedures were performed.  No sleep was noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an overriding alpha frequency rhythm mainly seen in the frontal chain.  Intermittently there is burst suppression.  The EEG appears to be reactive at times.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
Frontal alpha rhythm, usually seen mainly throughout the frontocentral regions, almost throughout the whole recording.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and frontal alpha.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  The frontal alpha in the setting of infarction is sometimes seen in alpha coma; however, the fact that the patient may be following commands is suggestive of a much better prognosis, this is likely related to medications affect.
