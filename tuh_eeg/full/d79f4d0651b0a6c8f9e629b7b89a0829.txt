CLINICAL HISTORY: 105 year old woman with right hemiparesis.

MEDICATIONS: ASA, Heparin, Protonix

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The technologist has some difficult with this bedside EEG because the patient is contractured.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a very unusual pattern. Despite the limitations of the bedside EEG, at times, the left hemisphere is pretty well organized with an 11 hertz alpha rhythm and a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry with more theta on the right and disruption on the right. Other sections of the record show the converse pattern with well defined alpha on the right and more theta on the left, although when alpha is seen on the right, there is still some rhythmic 4-5 hertz beta on the right.

HR: 60 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, almost alternating focal slowing and disruption of the alpha rhythm.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are unusual findings at any age and are of unclear significance. Correlation with imaging may be helpful given the possibility that this patient has suffered an acute stroke and may well have pre-exiting ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
