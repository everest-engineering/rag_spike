History:		32 YO MALE FOUND DOWN UNRESPONSIVE IN STREET. CC CARDIAC ARREST S/P PEA ARREST ,LIKELY HEROIN OVERDOSE. PT HAS NOW BEEN OFF OF VERSED FOR 24 HOURS
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
PROPRANOLOL, PROTONIX, LEVAQUIN, LOVENOX, FENTANYL
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. There is an intermittent muscle artifact seen with associated facial twitching seen on video. No clear electrocerebral correlate was seen on the EEG. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was a mild reactivity to painful stimuli. Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse Attenuation, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL  EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and attenuation.   These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction in the setting of anoxic injury and in the absence of sedatives  this carries a poor prognosis for functional recovery. The myoclonus observed in the video had no EEG correlate.
