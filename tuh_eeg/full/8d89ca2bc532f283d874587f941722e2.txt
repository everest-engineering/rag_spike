CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult male with anxiety and episodes of tremulousness.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Ativan, Klonopin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient recalled feeling a bit tremulous during this 24-hour section of the record.  No clinical seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  On very rare occasions, there was rare, subtle underlying focal slowing in the left temporal region.  Wicket was noted from either temporal region in drowsiness.  Sleep was relatively fragmented.  Stage II sleep was achieved with POSTS and spindles.
Event:  Tremulousness time 11:10 a.m.  The patient was awake.  He had just spoken to his brother.  He notes tremulousness which produces a bit of muscle artifact but no epileptiform features.
Heart rate:  70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Long term video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Rare, left temporal intermittent slowing noted only on some days of the EEG recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A wicket is normal finding.  No seizures were recorded.  No sharp waves or spikes were noted.  The intermittent focal slowing from the left temporal region is of unclear clinical significance in this adult.
