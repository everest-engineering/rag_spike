MEDICATIONS:  Zosyn, vasopressin, epinephrine.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. ECS montage was employed.   Tactile and auditory stimulation of the patient was performed and the integrity of the system was checked. Temperature 101.1
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record are partially obscured by muscle, but there is no definitive cerebral activity.  Following application of vecuronium, at 3:48, an ECS pattern was identified.  There was no reactivity or variability.
Heart rate:  120.
IMPRESSION:  This 1-hour bedside portable EEG demonstrates no cerebral activity.  In the appropriate clinical context, this is associated with severe/unrecoverable cerebral.
