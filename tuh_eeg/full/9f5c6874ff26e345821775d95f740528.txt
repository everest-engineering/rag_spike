History:	46 year old man who is unresponsive. Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs


Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes,  comatose

Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 8/28/2014 till 8/29/2014.    Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events


Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background is severely attenuated and suppressed with a rare burst of polymorphic delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli. Summary  of  Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24-hour continuous video EEG due to marked background slowing/ burst? suppression and attenuation. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
