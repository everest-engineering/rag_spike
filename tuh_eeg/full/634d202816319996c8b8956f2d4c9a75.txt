Medications:	DEPAKOTE, TRAZODONE, SEROQUEL,RISPERDAL,  ALBUTEROL, ADVAIR,

Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excessive diffuse 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Symmetric vertex waves
appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal  region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces a strong symmetric photic driving response.  HR is 78.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  Excess beta activity is a nonspecific finding, likely a result of
medications such as benzodiazepines.The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG.
