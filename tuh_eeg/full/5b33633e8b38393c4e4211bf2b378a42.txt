History:	28 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8-9 Hz activity that
attenuates with eye opening.  The AP gradient is poor.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta
activity and intermittent brief bursts of diffuse theta-delta activity are captured.  Patient remains
awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces additional
diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization, moderate
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
