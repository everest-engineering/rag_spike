History:	25 year old man who has a history of seizures and schizophrenia, now presents with
worsening psychosis.
Medications:	Valproic Acid
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
No clear PDR or AP are observed.  The background consists of a mixture of low amplitude fast
activity admixed with overriding diffuse frontally predominant semirhythmic 5-5.5 Hz theta activity.
This activity does not evolve.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Other, frontally predominant semi-rhythmic theta activity
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute EEG due to diffuse frontally predominant slowing.
This finding is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
