CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed gentleman with a brain tumor,
craniotomy, seizures admitted with recurrent seizures on 3/25/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably
well-organized with a 7 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a breech rhythm with accentuation of
beta frequency activity in the right central region. In addition, there is some subtle,
arrhythmic delta. Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements and an
increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Subtle, focal slowing in the right frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breech rhythm described above is an anticipated
finding following craniotomy. No epileptiform features were seen but if seizures are an
important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is
suggested. The generalized background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of
cerebral function
