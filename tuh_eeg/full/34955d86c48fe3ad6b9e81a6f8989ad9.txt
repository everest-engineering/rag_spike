CLINICAL HISTORY:  76 year old right handed man who presents with an episode of left-sided body shaking with a history of diabetes, hypertension and previous right temporal CVA.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Aspirin, Zocor, Lisinopril, Heparin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep was recorded.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz with a low amplitude of 20-40 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta is seen, however, there is an asymmetry and there is a lack of it over the right hemisphere.  Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There is an asymmetric lack of beta seen over the right hemisphere, maximal over the right mid temporal region at T4.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Lack of faster frequencies in the right mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This reveals evidence of cortical dysfunction in the right hemisphere maximum in the temporal region consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
