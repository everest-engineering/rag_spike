DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is awake throughout much of the EEG. There is an 8.7 hertz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of background theta and scant background beta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Stage II sleep includes spindles and vertex waves.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. This EEG, performed a relatively short period after 8 mg of Ativan is relatively unremarkable.
