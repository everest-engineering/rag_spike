DATE OF THE RECORDING:  10/24/2012 from approximately 4:00 p.m. until 10/25/2012 at approximately 9:00 a.m.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old man with a past medical history of prior right hemispheric strokes, with resultant seizures.  He now presents with increase in seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 100 mg t.i.d. and zonisamide 200 mg at bedtime.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Seizure detection and spike detection software were activated.  The patient was also provided with an event button.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude well formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K complexes, slow wave sleep, and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  Intermittent polymorphic theta activity and paucity of faster frequencies are captured over the right hemisphere, most notable over the right temporal region.  This slowing is more obvious during sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:  Focal right hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the right temporal region.  No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal approximately 17-hour continuous video audio EEG due to mild right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right temporal region.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a prior history of right hemispheric strokes.  There were no electrographic seizures.
