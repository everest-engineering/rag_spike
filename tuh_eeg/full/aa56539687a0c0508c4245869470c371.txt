CLINICAL HISTORY:  Childhood epilepsy, seizure-free until March and April 2012 with two tonic clonic seizures and postictal confusion.  Seizure-free since the patient was started on Keppra.  History of dislocated shoulder with his seizure earlier this year.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 10 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. In drowsiness there is an increase in beta, followed by vertex, K-complexes, spindles and posts.  In the transition to sleep, there is a very subtle asymmetry with a bit of shifting rhythmic frontal theta from the right and left frontal regions.  Intermittent arousals from stage II sleep are noted.
Rare, benign epileptiform transients of sleep were identified.
The patient was in stage II sleep during photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due to slight asymmetries in terms of frontal theta in the transition in and out of sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  There were two benign epileptiform transients of sleep which disappeared in deeper stages of sleep and were simple sharp waves seen from the left or right.
The findings described above are nonspecific and may be correlated with history and imaging.  If additional information is needed, either a follow-up study or comparison with previous EEGs is suggested.
