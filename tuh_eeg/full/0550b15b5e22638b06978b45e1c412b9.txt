CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman with previous aneurysm coil in 2007, left-sided weakness, right-sided clip, hypertension, diabetes, and now admitted with weakness on the left side, a funny taste in her mouth, and numbness in the body and tongue.

MEDICATIONS:  Ultram, Neurontin, aspirin, Bactrim, ketorolac, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is excess beta and a mild degree of disorganization noted bilaterally.  There is some shifting slowing noted and a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.  Intermittent, paroxysmal slowing with an increase in amplitude and an increase in theta was noted.  On a few occasions as the patient becomes drowsy and alpha rhythm drops out, it drops out a little faster on the right than the left.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with supra-harmonic driving.

HEART RATE:  Sometimes irregular.  78 beats per minute.

IMPRESSIONS:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Underlying disorganization.
3. Shifting slowing but seen primarily in the right hemisphere, in particular in the temple region.
4. Somewhat asymmetric alpha rhythm with drop out of alpha on the right earlier than the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features are relatively subtle in this record and the overall picture is 1 of excess beta and disorganization.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow-up EEG may be of value.
