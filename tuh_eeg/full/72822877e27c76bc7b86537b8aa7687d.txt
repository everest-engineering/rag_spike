History:	59 year old woman with a history of heart failure, on coumadin, with a therapeutic
inr, now presents with episodes of confusion.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 6.5-7 Hz theta activity.  The
expected AP gradient is present.  Diffuse polymorphic excess theta and delta activity are captured.
Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur
throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  Symmetrical sleep spindles
are captured.  Patient rapidly transitions to sleep.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute potable EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and presence of FIRDA. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is
seen in encephalopathy (most commonly), bilateral deep white matter lesions and increased ICP.
Patient rapidly transitions to sleep, so some degree of the background slowing could be related to
an excessively drowsy/ sleep deprived patient.
