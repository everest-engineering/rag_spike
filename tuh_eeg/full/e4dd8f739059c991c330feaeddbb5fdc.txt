ABUSE, Benzodiazepine  ABUSE. History of WITHDRAWAL SZS.
Medications:	PERCOCET, LORAZEPAM, METHADONE, NICOTINE PATCH
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. There is excess 7 Hz theta notes in the background  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness,
the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
Excess theta.Excess beta. HR: 66
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
Mildly abnormal EEG , awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present. The excess
beta and theta may represent medication effect
