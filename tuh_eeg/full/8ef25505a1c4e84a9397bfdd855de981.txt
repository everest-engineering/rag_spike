CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed male with left carotid stenosis.

MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Simvastatin, ASA, Isosorbide

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. In the transition to drowsiness there are bursts of paroxysmal slowing and a few bursts of shifting slowing, more so on the right than the left. Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Occasional bursts of shifting slowing are expectable at this age. No epileptiform features and no sustained focal features were observed.
