CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old female with dementia, diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, presenting with new onset seizure, left upper extremity shaking, eyes rolled back, lip smacking for about 5 minutes. CT of the head showed a left frontal encephalomalacia, diffuse atrophy, and bilateral white matter ischemic changes.

MEDICATIONS: Protonix, Lovenox, Keppra, Insulin, Synthroid, Metformin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed. This was an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG with a mixture of delta and theta. Stimulation of the patient produces transition to more of a theta pattern with decreased delta. Shifting slowing Is noted. Left frontal region is sometimes mildly attenuated compared to the right. Stage 2 sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most compatible with diffuse cerebral dysfunction. There are no epileptiform features. There is artifact from the right frontal electrode. If additional information is needed, a repeat study in the lab is suggested.
