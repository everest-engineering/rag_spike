History:	58 year old man presents with unresponsiveness.
Medications:	KEPPRA, intermittent Ativan throughout the recording epoch
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~18 hours from 11/2/2015 till 11/3/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower
waveforms over the left.  Early in the recording the background consists of diffuse slow delta activity,
underriding theta and fast activity, with paucity of faster frequencies over the left.  As the recording
progresses, there is diffuse background attenuation and appearance of diffuse sleep-spindle-like
waveforms.  At ~10:49 am, there is rapid attenuation of the background with no discernable
cerebral activity captured.  It corresponds to rapid decrease in heart rate from ~130 bpm to ~ 60
bpm.  At ~10:50:30 am, intermittent rhythmic artifact appears.  It corresponds to administration of
chest compressions (as seen on the video review).  At the end of resuscitation, some attenuated
diffuse slow delta activity is captured (unclear if it is artifact) and QRS complexes are present on a
single EKG lead.  By the end of the recording (~11:37 am), no cerebral activity is detected.
Summary of Findings:
Other, ECI by the end of the recording
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~18 hour continuous video EEG due to progressive diffuse slowing and lack
of discernable cerebral activity at the end of the recording.
