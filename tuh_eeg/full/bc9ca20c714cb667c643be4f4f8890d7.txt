CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old male with lifelong epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizures, a seizure 4 days ago out of sleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and phenobarbital, previously Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a greater than 20 minute, technically satisfactory EEG aside from T1-T2 impedances which were slightly greater than 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous background theta.
The overall, awake background is relatively low voltage.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic theta.  Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Epileptiform discharges:  Notable in this record were left anterior temporal sharp waves, which were relatively rare.  They ranged from a high amplitude 70 microvolt  T1 sharp waves to more discreet left anterior temporal sharp waves with variable maximum.  On 1 occasion, there is a phase reversal in the referential montage between T1 and F7.  One of these discharges also seems to have more of a left frontocentral localization.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves noted in drowsiness.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 4th EEG for this patient.  Only 1 prior EEG identified the left temporal sharp waves, but prior EEGs did identify the excess background theta.  This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
