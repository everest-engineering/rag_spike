CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old woman comes with an episode of profound hypoglycemia, seizure, brain injury, now with a seizure today and associated catatonia.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Insulin, Lamictal, Heparin, Levothyroxine, Protonix, Lorazepam, Nitrofurantoin, Benadryl

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has been uncooperative and was sedated for the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern primarily with a theta delta frequency pattern and intermittent bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity. Some of these are more prominent in the right compared to the left. The FIRDA is more prominent as the individual becomes drowsy. She seems to be inattentive, intermittently alerting and looking about. This pattern is followed by some frontal delta. Lambda is observed. The patient is carefully monitored by a nurse and the technologist during the study.
HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed today. When the patient is cooperative, it may be important to reassess the background. The patient's current mental state, however, is not ictal although it may be toxic or metabolic or postictal.
