CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed woman admitted 8/31/2012 with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and head trauma.  The patient had a fall in the bathroom this morning and then a tonic clonic seizure characterized by foaming of the mouth, bilateral flexed and elevated arms, tonic activity.  Blood sugar of 8.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lovenox, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of diffuse theta.  There are a handful of left temporal sharp waves overall in the record.  There is a frontal asymmetry with a bit of left temporal slowing noted early in the record, not as prominent later on.  Muscle and movement artifact are noted when the patient is a bit more active.  She is unable to fall asleep.
HR:    126 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Prominent excess theta.
Left temporal sharp waves.
Transient left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG suggests a diffuse cerebral function with special, focal features.  No epileptiform features were observed.
