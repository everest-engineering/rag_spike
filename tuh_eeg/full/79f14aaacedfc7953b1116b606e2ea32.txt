Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Two bursts of generalized 40-60uV and 4-4.5 ms frontally-maximal
spikes are present. However please note that both burst appear to begin slight more on the left.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, intermittent generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of generalized spike and wave discharges.
These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
