CLINICAL HISTORY:  87 year old female with 3 episodes of witnessed tonic-clonic seizure with bowel and bladder incontinence with a past medical history of dementia, hypertension and epilepsy as well as diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Dilantin, Fexofenadine, Namenda, Prandin, Sertraline, Lisinopril.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  However, the patient was very restless and confused during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient has multiple episodes of movement artifact effecting the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz.  There is no normal frontal central beta and no normal sleep architecture.   No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.  At times the slow waves improved slightly to more of a theta pattern but it mainly remained in the delta frequency.  At times there appears to be some shifting slowing towards the temporal lobes but not clearly contained.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
