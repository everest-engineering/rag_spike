DATE OF STUDY:  September 9th to September 10th.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Amphotericin, Keppra, propofol, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  During this section of the record, the patient was intubated and sedated.  His propofol dose was increased and then decreased.  No clinical seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial hours of the EEG demonstrate a pattern that is richer in muscle and movement artifact as well as faster frequency activity.  In the initial sections, there is a great deal of artifact, but there is also some rhythmic theta noted in the central regions without clear frequency evolution.  There is some asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic theta noted in the right central region relevant to the left.
With titration of sedative hypnotic medications, the background EEG becomes slower with more delta and frontal beta.
Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  None.
Electrographic Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 110 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This first 24 hours of video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:
Pharmacologic pattern.
Absence of electrographic seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG recording will be continued.
