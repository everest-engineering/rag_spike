CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old right-handed construction worker without past epilepsy risk factors.  Patient was in the emergency room February 28 after seizure, positive tox screen for benzodiazepines, and use of tramadol.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This was an awake and a sleep record in an individual who seemed to be a bit anxious and had involuntary jerking during sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a small amount of disorganization and a small amount of theta.  Temporal wicket was noted.
As the patient drifts off to sleep, occasional twitching was noted typically of his head but sometimes of his leg.  The involuntary jerking disappears when the patient sustains stage I sleep with vertex waves and posts.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response but the patient seemed to be falling asleep during photic stimulation.  Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a slightly abnormal electroencephalogram for an adult of this age due to:
Slight background disorganization.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen. The background disorganization is a nonspecific finding.  It may be related to medications.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.  In that there is a question of benzodiazepine withdrawal, additional monitoring may be helpful for the tics and twitches which did not have a definitive EEG signature.
