CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old male admitted 2 days ago for seizures, history of alcohol abuse,change in mental status
MEDICATIONS:  Omeprazole. Ativan, Atenolol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the alpha rhythm is approximately 8.3 to 8.5 Hz.  There is excess background theta.  A subtle asymmetry was noted with a little bit more slowing in the left relevant to the right.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for photoelectric artifact, but no clear driving.  By the close of the record, there are some sections with maximal wakefulness with somewhat better organized background.  Frequent eye blink was noted.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess theta.
Somewhat asymmetric theta with a bit more so on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG is similar to the previous study was excess theta, but there is a little less muscle artifact in the study.  Neither EEG identified epileptiform activity.
