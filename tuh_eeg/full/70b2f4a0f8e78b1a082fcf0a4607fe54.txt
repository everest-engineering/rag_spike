AGE: 27 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/01/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Inpatient
EEG TYPE: Routine, awake-and-asleep EEG #: 15-1269
HISTORY :
27 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for a single seizure. Patient denies previous seizures. He says he was using KS and denies any other drugs . No family history of seizures. Head CT 8/30 - negative.
MEDICATIONS:
Heparin
SEDATION : None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system . This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11-12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep.
Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present . EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Not performed Photic Stimulation: Not performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
