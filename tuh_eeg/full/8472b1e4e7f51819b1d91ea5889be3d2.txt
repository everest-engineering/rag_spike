CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old right handed man with a history of tremors and syncope as well as secondary generalized tonoclonic seizures found unresponsive on 09/01/2012, for an unknown amount of time.  He also has a significant past medical history of hypertension, COPD, depression, alcohol abuse and drug abuse.

MEDICATIONS:  Nitroglycerin, ASA, Lovenox, Seroquel, Xanax, Lorazepam, Tylenol

REASON FOR STUDY:  Unresponsiveness and a history of seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact over the left temporalis region.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9-10 Hz that appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  However, overall during wakefulness there is mild excessive theta at 5-7 Hz seen frequently.  The patient drowses off quickly, but no classic stage I sleep architecture is seen easily.  No photic stimulation or activating procedures were performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 and at times at T3 at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
2. There was mild excessive theta at 5-7 Hz seen in wakefulness.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal and mid temporal focal slowing.
2. Some mild excessive theta in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region as well as mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
