58-year-old woman with new-onset fainting spells and no PMH of seizures.
MEDICATIONS: No AEDs
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: international  10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25·40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5.15uV. 18-25Hz beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness. The background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes Intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4 Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR Is 70 bpm.
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy
