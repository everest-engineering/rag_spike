CLINICAL HISTORY:  85 year old right handed man with a history of severe dementia as well as multiple small subarachnoid hemorrhages and focal motor seizures who presents for seizure evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Atenolol, Lisinopril, Insulin, Glyburide, Amantadine, Risperdal, Zocor, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the record, the patient is very agitated and confused and makes the recording while awake difficult due to multiple electrode motion artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures are not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording; however, during more wakefulness appears to be more of a theta pattern at 5 to 7 Hz, but this is limited due to motion artifact and cannot be clearly evaluated.
SEIZURES  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
