CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old male, status post pacemaker implant with recurrent seizure like spells.  Previous, normal EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Ambien, Flomax, Zocor.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable EEG, capturing primarily wakefulness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by subtle background slowing and slow rolling eye movements.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicited a subtle driving response.  The driving response was seen even at lower flash frequencies.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the  2nd normal EEG for this adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  In this individual, who may be having frequent seizures, additional EEG recording strategies including inpatient or outpatient EEG monitoring may be a value.
