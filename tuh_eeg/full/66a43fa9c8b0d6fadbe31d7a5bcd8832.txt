CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 47-year-old woman with a history of a cerebral aneurysm, lupus, psychosis, epilepsy and stroke admitted with left-sided numbness, weakness, and slurred speech.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, gabapentin, tramadol, Seroquel, and mycophenolate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  This is a technically challenging EEG, the patient was complaining of uncomfortable skin and had difficulty tolerating the appropriate impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Although, this EEG includes significant muscle movement artifact, in maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta.  Shifting arrhythmic delta activity was noted, which was a bit more prominent in the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Vertex waves were slightly asynchronous.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and briefly drowsy record due to.
Excess beta.
Somewhat disorganized pattern.
Shifting and slowing, a bit more prominent in the right hemisphere compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If further characterization of the patient's epileptiform pattern is needed, a follow up study in the lab, capturing sleep may be of value.
