History:	60 yo female presented to ed with r/ arm, leg, face numbness starting in the am
3/26.
Medications:	Heparin, Protonix, Plavix, Pravachol, Insulin, Hydralazine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by hemispheric asymmetry with lower amplitude and loss of
faster frequencies over the left posterior quadrant. Posterior dominant rhythm is 10Hz, which
attenuates with eye opening.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Occasional left temporal slowing
, Hemispheric asymmetry with attenuation and loss of faster frequencies over the left cerebral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of Occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction.  Attenuation and loss of faster frequencies over
the left posterior quadrant is consistent with a history of left hemispheric cortical infarct.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
