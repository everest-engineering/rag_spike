History:	65 year old man with a first time seizure.
Medications:	Keppra, Hydrochlorothiazide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a low amplitude 8.5-9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates intermittent premature QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Other, A single EKG lead demonstrates intermittent premature QRS complexes.
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake-only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. A single EKG lead demonstrates intermittent premature QRS complexes.
