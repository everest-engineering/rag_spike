CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unknown female, found down with multiple medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:    Oxycodone, benzodiazepines, methadone, Dilantin, norepinephrine, Narcan, Ativan.
.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside for this intubated patient using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was responsive, particularly at the end of the EEG and was biting on the endotracheal tube.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a lower voltage, suppressed pattern.  Frontal alpha frequency activity was noted in earlier sections of the record.  In later sections of the record, the patient is a bit more reactive and biting down on the endotracheal tube, producing significant muscle artifact.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:  Replacement of normal background with a relatively low voltage slow pattern with a small amount of frontal alpha and beta frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates reactivity.  It supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Contributing factors may be toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, as well as medication effect.
