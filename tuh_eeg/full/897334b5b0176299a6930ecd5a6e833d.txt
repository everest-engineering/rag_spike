CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed male with a single seizure in early
February 2009.

MEDICATIONS: None.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness this a well organized record with a
10.7 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.
Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing. Vertex waves and posts
are noted in stage 1 sleep with spindles and stage 2 sleep. Hyperventilation produces
more of a drowsy pattern. The patient drifts off to sleep after hyperventilation. Photic
stimulation is remarkable for scant driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG for this individual. A
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
