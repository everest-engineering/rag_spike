CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 85-year-old woman found to have right gaze deviation and staring with a previous history of left middle cerebral artery infarct and aphasia.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was some intermittent electrode muscle artifact seen throughout the recording.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and lorazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior-dominant rhythm which reaches 7.5 Hz over the right hemisphere and appears to be reactive to eye opening.  Over the left hemisphere there is a lack of normal posterior dominant rhythm seen.  There is also normal frontal and central beta over the right hemisphere not seen well over the left hemisphere.  The patient appears to be recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Normal stage I architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing seen over the left hemisphere maximal at F7/D3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  In addition, there is a loss of faster frequencies over that region.
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram due to focal slowing over the left hemisphere with loss of faster frequencies in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal region which is consistent with a known stroke. In addition, there is evidence if diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
