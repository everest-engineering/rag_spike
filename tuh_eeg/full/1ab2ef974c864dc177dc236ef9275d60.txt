Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric excess 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions
independently.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent independent bilateral
midtemporal focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in those regions,
which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
