Medications:	KEPPRA, PHENOBARBITAL, DILANTIN, ABILIFY , LORAZEPAM YESTERDAY
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  At time with sleep the focal slowing become slightly monomorphic for
seconds but it does not evolve.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 120  Technical difficulties: Due
the patients hair some electrodes frequently became displaced.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent focal slowing in the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
