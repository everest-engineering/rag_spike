CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old man with complaints of headaches.  He became sleepy.  He came to the emergency room and was sent home, and the next day he was found to be seizing.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Midazolam
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video long-term EEG for 19 hours was performed at bedside using  standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient's data was reviewed using spike detection software, seizure detection software, and the patient's alarm events as well as nurses' notes.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At the last 5 to 6 hours of the recording, there are multiple electrode artifacts.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background that, at best, reaches 7 Hz, best seen over the right hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Left hemispheric slowing, maximal in the anterior temporal region with associated intermittent loss of faster frequencies.
Infrequent F7/T3 sharp waves.
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left hemispheric slowing, maximal in the left anterior temporal region, with additional loss of faster frequencies over that hemisphere and infrequent sharp waves.
There is also generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known trauma and damage to that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology but may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
