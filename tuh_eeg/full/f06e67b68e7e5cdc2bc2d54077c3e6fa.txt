History:	PT PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP EEG LAST SZ 2 YRS. DENIES ANY RECENT SZ
Medications:	TRILEPTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. There is bihemispheric asymmetry, with higher amplitude seen
over the left central parietal region.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left parietal-central and temporal region
maximum at C3 and P3..  Occasional left centrotemporal sharp waves are present with no
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, moderate, left central
Breach artifact, left
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake only due to occasional epileptiform discharges in the left
centro-temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region. As well as  continuous focal slowing in the left centrotemporal region.  This finding is
indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  Breach rhythm is consistent with the patient's
history of craniotomy.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
