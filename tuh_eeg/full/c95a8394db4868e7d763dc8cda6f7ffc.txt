CLINICAL HISTORY:  Scarlet fever with seizures at age 3 or 4, past history of testicular cancer and febrile convulsions.  Two seizures while falling asleep in March, perhaps associated with trazodone use.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by a small amount of frontocentral theta, POSTs and attenuation of the alpha.  Very brief stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  Heart rate 82 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
