History:	61 YR MALE S/P ASSAULT 6/4. FOUND TO HAVE INCREASE HTN, WENT FOR
STENT CATH POST PROCEDURE PT CONFUSED.  CT HEAD RIGHT FRONTAL  ?
SAH.VS EMBOLIC CVA.   PT WITH RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS/ APHASIA
Medications:	MORPHINE 1 MG 4 AM, INSULIN, ATORVASTATIN, CIPRO, AMLODIPINE,
HYDRALAZINE, METOPROLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies, worst on the right side.  There are sleep spindles.
Occasional left focal sharp waves are present in the left frontocentral region.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to painful stimuli.
HR is 90-100.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left, Frontocentral
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse, more on the right side
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  1) Diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  2)
Occasional epileptiform discharges in the left frontocentral region.  These findings are indicative of
a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region.
