CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old male with fall down the steps. Right femoral fracture and cranial fracture. Status post code on January 16. Evaluate for coma
MEDICATIONS: Famotidine, Diltiazem, Adenosine, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Combivent, Insulin, Norepinephrine, Vasopressin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This bedside portable EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with delta and theta frequency activity. There is occasional frontal eye movement. The majority of the record is 1 to 2.5 Hz delta, but there are smaller amounts of theta. Stimulation of the patient produces some muscle artifact. There is what may well be a skull defect at C3. Occasional triphasic waves are noted as there are very simple in morphology frontal sharp waves.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Although the overall picture is one of relatively rhythmic slowing, there is a suggestion of subtle underlying sharp activity in the frontal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. No seizures were recorded. As the patient recovers from the cranial injury, additional EEG recording may be helpful.
