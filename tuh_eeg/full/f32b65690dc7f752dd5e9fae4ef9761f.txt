CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old left handed male with COPD, depression, and 4 convulsions, the most recent August 14, 2012.

MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, Celexa, Naproxen

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was very anxious and had a great deal of muscle artifact.  Photic  stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the prominent muscle artifact, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta that limited sleep was achieved.  The patient had difficulty with photic stimulation and appeared to be clenching his face.  Despite this was a suggestion of a driving response.

HR:    120 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG  awake and briefly drowsy.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Due to the technical limitations described above, consideration for a follow up EEG with sleep may be helpful.  Conversely, determining why the patient is so anxious might be helpful in achieving relaxation.
