CLINICAL HISTORY: A 53-year-old male status post hemispherectomy in childhood with chronic static encephalopathy, past history of renal carcinoma, depression, psychiatric issues, behavioral problems, and previous suicide attempt.  Marked cranial deformities.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, insulin, Keppra, Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had 5 episodes of left arm numbness for which she pushed the button.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is abnormal, low voltage.  It is relatively suppressed from the right hemisphere, relative to the left. The drowsy pattern includes rhythmic 6 Hz activity from the left with lower voltage more suppressed pattern on the right.
Sleep:  There is very little sleep for this individual who is primarily drowsy.  The sleep section is low voltage and slow.
Clinical events:  There are frequent bursts of slow, spike, and wave which are maximum in the left frontal region using the scalp electrodes.  They are seen in wakefulness, but also on occasion in sleep.  The event may be associated with the head turning or nodding slightly to the right.  The left hand typically moves in towards the groin or towards the midline, although on one occasion there was no scratching.  These events last 5-11 seconds and are not recognized by the patient or others as ictal.  The behavior may be so subtle, but there is always movement of the right arm.
Push button events:  The patient pushed the button many times for a feeling of left sided numbness.  This included 4:25 p.m., 10:28 p.m., 12:58 a.m., 3:30 a.m., 11:17 a.m., on 03/19/2013 at 2:42 a.m.  All of these demonstrate an awake pattern without definitive epileptiform activity.
No major myoclonus or involuntary movements of the left arm were noted.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
