CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old male diagnosed 2 years ago at Mercer Hospital with epilepsy.  Seizures characterized by funny taste in mouth, followed by loss of consciousness, and then generalized tonic clonic activity.  The patient was admitted 2 days ago after a seizure.  The patient now is having staring spells.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was awake with his eyes closed throughout much of the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Very brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and a small increase in theta.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If this patient is thought to have frequent, clinical seizures EEG monitoring, either inpatient or outpatient, may be valuable.
