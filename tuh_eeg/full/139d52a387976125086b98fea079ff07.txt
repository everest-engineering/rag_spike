History:	66 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P CODE ON 2/25/14 FOUND
UNRESPONSIVE AND PULSELESS CODED X 7 MIN. PT ADMIT ON 2/18/14 FOR
C/O DECREASE IN INTAKE AND KNEE PAIN, FOUND HYPERGLYCEMIC  2/2 NOT
TAKING MEDS.PMHX SIG FOR CKD, HTN, ANEMIA, DM, HLD,
Medications:	Insulin, Piperacillin/ Tazobactam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular 4-7Hz activity.  As drowsiness
progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear and state changes are noted.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 72 and irregular.  There was an
intermittent right ear, temporal and frontal beta discharge seen only in wakefulness. It did not
appear to be artifactual but it is of unclear significance.  There appears to be some variability and
reactivity in the record.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of diffuse background attenuation and  diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
