DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.
There are brief EPOCHS with vertex waves and spindles, followed by arousals. There is a small amount of excess theta in maximal wakefulness and a small amount of shifting slowing. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation with POSTS and spindles.

HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
