History:	51 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ONSET SZ X 5 YRS AGO WITH LAST SZ
X 5 YRS AGO. NOW WITH C/C OF FRONTAL HA LASTING ALL DAY. DENIES
BLURRY VISION, NAUSEA ETC.
Medications:	TEGRETOL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent left temporal theta was noted in wakefulness, increasing with hyperventilation.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces left temporal
slow theta.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent left temporal focal slowing
No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
