CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 77-year-old right-handed gentleman with a past medical history of CHF status post C3-C4 laminectomy admitted to the hospital for altered mental status.

MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, metoprolol, Novolin, pantoprazole.

INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed at the bedside in ICU setting using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to on T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captures patients in a sedated state.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the sedated state, there was diffuse slowing of the background with mild attenuation characterized by 3 Hz delta activity with amplitude of 50-60 microvolt intermixed with 6-7 Hz theta activity, 30-40 microvolt in amplitude.  There was also alpha activity noted during one episode of arousal after stimulation with a frequency of 8-8.5.  There were spontaneous variability and also reactivity on stimulating the patient.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.  There were some sleep elements as spindles noted.  Heart rate was 100-110 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a sedated state due to diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background activity.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background are suggestive of severe encephalopathy, which is most likely in this patients could be related to sedations, alternatively it could be due to toxic, metabolic, or infectious encephalopathy or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures if clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
