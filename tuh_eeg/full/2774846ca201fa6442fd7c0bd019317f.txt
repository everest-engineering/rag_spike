CLINICAL HISTORY:    35 year old right-handed female woman with pseudotumor cerebri, myasthenia gravis, bipolar disease, hypothyroidism,  gastric bypass surgery, found unresponsive and persistently confused.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Mestinon, Neurontin, Zanaflex, Celexa, Narcan, Decadron. INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is quite somnolent
and leans over lying on her right side.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Much of the record includes a theta frequency pattern with intermittent bursts of slow delta.  There is occasional 8 Hz activity in the background and spontaneous arousals are noted.  The bursts of slow delta are typically under 3 seconds and are relatively symmetric, frontally predominant.
HR:   72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Background slowing.
2.  Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of many different causes.  No epileptiform features are noted.
