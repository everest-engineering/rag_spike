CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 68-year-old male of unknown handedness, recent CABG on October 23rd for atrial fibrillation.  The patient had an episode of aphasia, poor responsiveness, for which a stroke alert was called.  Now improving.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Tamsulosin, Advair, atorvastatin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside at 8:59 a.m. using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake.  The background EEG is diffusely slow with excess theta.  A well-defined alpha frequency posterior dominant rhythm is difficult to identify and the patient quickly drifted off to sleep.  A subtle asymmetry is noted and that there is more alpha frequency activity noted in the right hemisphere, particularly in the central regions.
Drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in eye movements with slow rolling eye movements and overall an increase in background slowing.
Heart rate irregular 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
Generalized background slowing.
At least, initially, with a subtle asymmetry in terms of alpha frequency activity in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen for the patient.  The generalized background slowing is more compatible with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as a metabolic encephalopathy.  The transient subtle asymmetry and alpha frequency activity may be correlated clinically and could be seen either in postictal state or following TIA.
