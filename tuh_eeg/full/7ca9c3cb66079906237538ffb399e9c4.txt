History:	51 year old man status post anoxic brain injury.
Medications:	Versed, Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 18 hours from 3/15/2015 till 3/16/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording, the background is burst-supp pressed.  As
the recording progresses, the background becomes continuous.  Bursts contain a mixture of
frequencies at variable amplitudes.  Notably, they contain generalized occipitally predominant
epileptiform discharges.  Each burst is associated with eye opening that lasts the duration of the
burst.  As the recording progresses and individual bursts disappear, episodes of eye opening stop as
well.  By the end of the recording the background consists of ~ 2 Hz GPEDs.  No normal sleep
There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges) generalized, 2 Hz by the end of the recording
Burst-suppression pattern
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous 18-hour continuous EEG due to presence of up to 2 Hz GPEDs
seen by the end of the recording, burst suppression and lack of reactivity. These findings indicate
marked diffuse cerebral cortical dysfunction with increased cortical irritability.  These findings were
conveyed to the neurology consult team.
