STUDY DATA:  02/05/2013 to 02/06/2013 for a total of 24 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old man with history of refractory localization related epilepsy here for classification and differential.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection, as well as seizure detection software, along with patient's alarms and nurses notes were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and at times at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Seizures or events:  The patient reports having an event at 6:30 in the morning where he shook both his arms and lost consciousness, however, during the EEG recording no such event was noted and no EEG changes were seen throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction to the lateral mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  This is day 2 of EMU admission.  No events have been captured.
