CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old male with epilepsy following subarachnoid hemorrhage, recurrent hospitalizations for seizures due to noncompliance.  Left frontotemporal encephalomalacia.  The patient transferred from Episcopal Hospital after status epilepticus requiring phenytoin load and propofol drip.
MEDICATIONS:  phenytoin load and propofol drip.
INTRODUCTION: continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed  at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and unresponsive, although during the monitoring, the patient was moved to a different room by the nurses because of concern for agitation.  EEG monitoring was discontinued when patient was awake and uncooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with low-voltage delta and generous, beta.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.  Tactile stimulation of the patient by the nurses does not significantly alter the record, but as the recording continues, there is a bit more frontal delta.
By 9:50 on Jan 1 patient was awake, agitated: EEG demonstrates generous beta but little focal slowing.
Seizures:  None.
Epileptiform Detections:  None.
Focal features: shifting temporal slowing
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  16 hours of EEG monitoring is remarkable for,
Essentially a pattern of diffuse beta and low voltage delta, with intermittent attenuations.
By the morning of January 1, a bit more variability in the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were seen.  There were no epileptiform features.  Overall, this EEG is most compatible with pharmacologic coma, and then an awake pattern with generous beta.
