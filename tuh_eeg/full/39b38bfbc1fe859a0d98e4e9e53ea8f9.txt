History:	33 year old woman with seizures.
Medications:	ALEPSAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing in frequency during drowsiness/  Intermittent left anterior temporal
irregular sharp waves are noted during drowsiness.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F1/T1
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, occasional, left temporal, anterior, most pronounced during drowsiness
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG because of occasional focal slowing and
epileptiform discharges in the left anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a
potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the left temporal region.
