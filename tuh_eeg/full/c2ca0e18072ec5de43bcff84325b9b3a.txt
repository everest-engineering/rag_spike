AGE: 20 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 08/25/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: Awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1228
HISTORY:
a 20 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for a history of 3 seizures. The seizures started about 1 month ago after using K2. No h/o childhood seizures. PMH: asthma, depression. This is a follow up EEG. Per patient, the last 3 days she has been trembling and shaky but not actually having seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
Prenatal Multivit-Ca-Min-Fe-FA	(PRENATAL VITAMIN) Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
PNV with Ca,no.71-iron-FA 27-1 mg Tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
Keppra Dilantin
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with T1/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep transients are not captured. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
This study is similar to her prior routine EEG done 8/10/2015; neither the current study nor the study on 8/10 capture sleep.
