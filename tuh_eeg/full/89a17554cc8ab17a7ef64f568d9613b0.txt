REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 32-year-old man with history of seizures after a motor vehicle accident in 1995.  Last seizure 1-2 months ago with staring spells and shaking.  Denies loss of consciousness.  Lasted 5-10 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and Zonegran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontal central beta.  Overall, the background has intermittent generalized slowing, even during wakefulness in the theta range, which is intermixed with a frontal predominant delta slowing seen in the bilateral frontal regions.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness, and activating procedures were performed including hyperventilation and photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was continuous frontalis and temporalis muscle artifact seen continuously throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen in the bilateral frontal regions with a low amplitude and a frequency of 2-4 Hz.
Generalized slow waves.  There is excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz seen frequently throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  60
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral frontal slowing as well as mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral frontal region, in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, of which may be related to his previous injury, although they are nonspecific findings.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
