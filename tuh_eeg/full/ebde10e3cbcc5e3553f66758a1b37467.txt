Medications:	RANITIDINE,METOPROLOL,LISINOPRIL,CITALOPRAM,HALOPERIDOL,DIPHENHYDRAMINE

Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  However there is excessive predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 5-7Hz
activity.  Some drowsiness is noted.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of Mild diffuse slowing and intermittent left
temporal focal slowing both of which are non-specific with regards to etiology.
