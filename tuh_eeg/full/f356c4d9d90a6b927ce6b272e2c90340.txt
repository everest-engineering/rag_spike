History:	67 YR OLD FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF SEIZURES THAT STARTED AFTER
TBI 6 YRS AGO. LAST SZ ONE WEEK AGO.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse excessive 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the
right midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 48-60.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In
addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta activity
could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
