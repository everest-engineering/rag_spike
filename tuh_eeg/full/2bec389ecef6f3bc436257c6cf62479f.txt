CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male with left MCA infarcts, right hemiparesis, sepsis, temperature 102.5 and obtundation. Neoplasm
MEDICATIONS: None Listed
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes slow theta and delta with rhythmic 3 to 5 Hz activity and arrhythmic frontal delta. There are independent, right or left frontal sharp wave some of which are periodic. In addition, there is a brief section of the record where there is more rhythmic frontal theta identified more so on the left than the right. This occurs in bursts and does not have the paroxysmal evolution of a seizure but it does occur as a burst.
HR: 96 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowly.
2. Periodic sharp waves identified from either hemisphere particularly in the frontal region.
3. Bursts of theta from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are worrisome and support a significant disturbance of cerebral function. Evaluation of this patient to make sure that there is not an underlying CNS infection is appropriate.
