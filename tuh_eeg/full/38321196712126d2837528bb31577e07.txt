REASON FOR STUDY:  Followup EEG.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 90-year-old woman, who presented for a followup EEG and there are no recent events reported.
MEDICATIONS:  List of medications are not known currently.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness, and activating procedures include photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In most awake state, posterior dominant rhythm is in range of up to 9 Hz seen in occipital region.  There is low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity distributed symmetrically.  Excess theta activity was seen during wakefulness with frequency of 7-7.5 Hz.  Intermittent focal slowing on left side, most pronounced in left frontotemporal region is seen with frequency of 5-7 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by lack of eye blink artifact and muscle artifact, and disappearance of posterior dominant rhythm.  Photic stimulation causes driving response.  There are no seizures or epileptiform discharges seen on this study.
Heart rate:  80 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Left frontotemporal slowing.
Excess theta activity during wakefulness.
No epileptiform discharges are seen.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Excess theta activity during wakefulness is suggestive of encephalopathy due to toxic, metabolic, infectious, degenerative cerebral dysfunction.  Left focal slowing can be due to focal cerebral dysfunction in this region.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform activity or seizures were seen during this record.
