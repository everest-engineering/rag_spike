CLINICAL HISTORY:  1week status post metformin overdose, now off sedative hypnotic medications, comatose on continuous hemodialysis. Evaluate for persistent coma.
MEDICATIONS: Levophed, , meropenem, Protonix, others.
I NTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was intubated and unresponsive. The patient is undergoing continuous hemodialysis throughout the EEG recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although some sections of the record are remarkable for significant muscle or other muscle like artifact, other sections of the record demonstrate a lower voltage pattern.
Essentially 2 patterns are identified: One of them is an intermittently discontinuous or attenuating pattern with periods of attenuation lasting 2-3 seconds and low voltage, alpha and theta frequency activity of 2-4 seconds in duration.  Other sections of the record include a lower voltage, more continuous pattern.
Heart rate: 104 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This continuous EEG monitoring session recorded 1 week status post central nervous system insult is remarkable for:
An intermittently discontinuous pattern.
A low voltage at times slow, but continuous pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG suggests a significant CNS insult, but there are sections in the record, in which the EEG is more continuous.  Ongoing clinical and neurodiagnostic assessment will be undertaken.
