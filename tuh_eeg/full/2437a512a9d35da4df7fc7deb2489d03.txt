CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed woman seizure free for more than 3 years.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This an awake through stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Awake musters asymmetric, 10 Hertz upper rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. A stage 2 sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and posts. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Prior EEG suggested Left temporal focus.
