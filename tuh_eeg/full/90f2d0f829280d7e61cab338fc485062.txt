History:	33yo woman 4 weeks pregnant p/w two seizures after stopping xanax two days ago,
previously taking 5-6mg/day. Pt reports hx of seizures managed at OSH, for which
she was taking gabapentin.
Medications:	Diazepam
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is very high amplitude with a 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse, frontally predominant beta activity is also seen.  As
drowsiness progresses, the background slows and vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR is 66 and slightly irregular.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake and drowsy EEG. Excess beta is a nonspecific finding and likely
secondary to benzodiazepine use.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was
not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
