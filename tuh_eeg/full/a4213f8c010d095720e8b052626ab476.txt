REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old woman with a change in mental status, confusion and fever.  No other past medical history was provided.

MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Zocor, vancomycin, nitroglycerin, Tegretol, Dilaudid.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG using performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  The patient appears to be recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness, although some remnants or sleep-like architecture is seen.  Activating procedures which included  photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.

Heart rate 102.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and amplitude 20-60 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
2. Occasional frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA):  Seen frequently throughout the recording.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to moderate generalized slowing as well as FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
