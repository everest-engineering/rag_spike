CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed male with phenobarbital overdose which he now states is due to a desire to become intoxicated, post traumatic epilepsy, frequent falling, agitation, and irritability.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Zoloft, Protonix, Lovenox, Tramadol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes generous beta.  There is excess theta.  There are bursts of shifting slowing noted in this sharply contoured record.  There is some independent, sharply contoured bursts in the left frontal central region, central temporal, and right frontal temporal.  Those from the right seem to be associated with a bit more disruption of fast activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, as well as disappearance of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation produces a great deal of artifact.
HR:    68 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive beta.
Bursts of sharply contoured slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing, particularly in the right temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  Well defined epileptiform activity was elusive.  A follow up study looking for epileptiform activity when the patient is more cooperative may be of more value.
