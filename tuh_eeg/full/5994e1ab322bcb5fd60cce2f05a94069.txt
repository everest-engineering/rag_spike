CLINICAL HISTORY:  67-year-old male, admitted with shortness of breath and unresponsiveness, acute respiratory distress, past history of seizures, now intubated, but awake in the ICU.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, ampicillin, norepinephrine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is resting comfortably in the ICU.  This is a technically acceptable record.  Eye opening is noted.  A 7 Hz posterior-dominant rhythm is noted in the occipital region, better demonstrated in the right compared to the left and asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres is noted and is characterized by a relative attenuation of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right, as well as disruption of the alpha rhythm and occasional arrhythmic delta activity, which is more prominent in the left compared to the right.  There are occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta noted bilaterally.
Sleep is not achieved.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intra-hemispheric asymmetry with more significant focal slowing on the left in comparison to the right.
Bursts of FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous EEGs in 2008.  At that time, the patient was experiencing left facial twitching without an EEG correlate.  If there any questions, additional EEG monitoring may be obtained.
