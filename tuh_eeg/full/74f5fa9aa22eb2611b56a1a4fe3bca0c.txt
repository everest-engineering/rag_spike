CLINICAL HISTORY:	76 year old female with 3 days of balance problems, slurred speech, and difficulty expressing herself.  The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and CHF.

MEDICATIONS: Metformin, ASA, Imdur, Benicar,  Tramadol,  Atenolol, Lipitor, Celebrex


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized. There  is an alpha rhythm of a 5Hz.    In  addition, there is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the left and a likely breech rhythm with some double phase reversing artifact.

HR: 	60 bpm


IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized slowing and disorganization.
2.	Left temporal amplitude asymmetry.
3.	Left temporal focal slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The diffuse features support a diffuse interruption of cerebral function and the focal features on the left can be correlated with imaging.
Careful review of the patient's history is advised.
