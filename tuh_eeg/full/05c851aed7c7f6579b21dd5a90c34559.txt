AGE: 18 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/20/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG # : 15-1713
HISTORY:
18 y.o. female with a history of headaches and jerking of extremities while on the stairs referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
methylphenidate	(CONCERTA) 27 mg CR tablet, Take	by mouth. bupropion (WELLBUTRIN XL) 150 mg 24 hr tablet,
escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) 10 mg tablet, Take 10 mg by mouth daily.
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was .recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.	Posterior slow waves of youth, a normal finding, were noted
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep was not obtained
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Produces a small increase in amplitude of the background
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and somewhat drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
