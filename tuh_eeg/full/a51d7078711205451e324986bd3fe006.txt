CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old woman with a history of a motor vehicle accident in 1972 status post coma for 3 months and aneurysm hemorrhage in January 2011 now with seizures, the last one on May 15, 2012, and they state they are now becoming more frequent.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10-11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an increased amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  During the recording, there is marked amount of rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness which is very sharply contoured but not epileptic.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bitemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the anterior temporal region bilaterally, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The increased amount of beta seen during the recording may be related at times to the use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
