CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old right-handed woman with childhood epilepsy, onset at age 2, treated with Depakote, seizure free for 6 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG in a patient who is extremely drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with posterior slow waves of youth.  Drowsiness is characterized by increase in background slowing, attenuation of the alpha rhythm with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage 2 sleep.
The patient is falling asleep and drifting into stage 2 sleep during both hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Clinical correlation in regard to this patient's excessive drowsiness is suggested.
