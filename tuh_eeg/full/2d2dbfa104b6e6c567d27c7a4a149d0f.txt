History:	57 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF LEFT ICA ANEURYSM.  HAD ANGIO FOR CAROTID
STENT, ARTERY TO NARROW NOW PRE OP FOR LEFT CEA.
Medications:	Elavil, Xanax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta is present.  No sleep architecture was present.
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region (maximum at T3) during
wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates occasional tachycardia
with heart rate above 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
