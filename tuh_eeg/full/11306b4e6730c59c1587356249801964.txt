CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old left handed man, presenting with a history of new onset seizures 2 to 3 years ago.  The patient has an aura of lightheadedness.  The last seizure was on February 29, 2012, an episode of tonic-clonic activity with loss of consciousness lasting about 6 to 7 minutes.  The patient stated that he returned to baseline after the seizure in a few minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opened to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient appeared to go into stage I and II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that an excessive amount of beta can be seen with the use of barbiturates or benzodiazepine or anxiety.  For this patient, with uncontrolled epilepsy, a sleep-deprived EEG may be beneficial.
