NEOPLASM OF PITUITARY GLAND CRANIOPHARYNGEAL DUCT POUCH F4 C4
HYPOPITUITARISM RESECTION 58 CM HEAD SEIZURE FREE SINCE 2011
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  Symmetric sleep spindles are present
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
