CLINICAL HISTORY:  33-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis, bipolar disease, and celiac.  The patient now has episodes in which she sees bright colors, becomes emotional, and becomes confused.  Positive family history of epilepsy.
MEDICINES:  Buspar, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  40 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was tense and anxious during the EEG. Sleep was attempted but not achieved. Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior-dominant rhythm with a small amount of background theta and generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.  Intermittently in wakefulness, there is rhythmic 3.5 to 5 hertz frequency activity in the left temporal region, which is somewhat irregular.  On one occasion, there is a single left temporal sharp wave with these bursts.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate left temporal theta.
Photic stimulation produced blinking and twitching, but no epileptiform activity.
Rhythmic left temporal 4 to 5 Hz activity was augmented in drowsiness, but deeper stages of sleep could not be achieved.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
somewhat irregular left temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings above may be correlated with imaging.  While the waveforms have some of the morphologies of rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness, ( a normal variant)  the activity described above is somewhat more irregular.   Given the patient's complex history described above, a more prolonged study capturing well-defined deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
