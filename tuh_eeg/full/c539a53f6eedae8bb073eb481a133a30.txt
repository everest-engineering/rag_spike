EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background at times reveals a  8.5Hz alpha rhythm.  Some intermittent symmetric 5-15uV,
18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  The background is mainly
composed of a disorganized diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
