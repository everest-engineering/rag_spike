LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 21-year-old man, who had a single generalized tonic-clonic convulsion in December 2013, in the setting of Xanax discontinuation.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications:  None.
INTRODUCTION:
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation   were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is captured.  During sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles and vertex waves are noted.  Hyperventilation is produced with good effort, and does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation is performed while the patient is primarily asleep, and does not result in a significant change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22 minute EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
