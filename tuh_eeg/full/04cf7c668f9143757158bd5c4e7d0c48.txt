History:	29 YR FEMALE WITH H/O SZS X4 YRS.  PT HAS RECENT INCREASE IN SZ
SINCE 12/13.  1 MONTH., USUALLY HAS AURA DY BEFORE DEJA VU/ DIZZY.
THEN HAS NOCTURNAL SZ THAT NIGHT. BODY STIFF POST SLEEPY.  PT
STOPPED MEDS IN APRIL WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT 7WKS
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral mid temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  There are intermittent bursts of frontal predominant generalized delta
activity that have an irregular and at times sharply contoured morphology. These bursts may
represent a fragmented generalized spike and wave.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Other, Generalized bursts of frontal predominant delta.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bitemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  In addition please note the above described bursts which are suspicious for a
generalized epileptiform activity. A prolonged EEG capturing Stage 2 sleep may be helpful in
elucidating the underlying nature of these discharges.
