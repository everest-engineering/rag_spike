CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, MVA, 2 aneurysms repaired.  Patient has seizures characterized by a loud sound followed by loss of consciousness, postictal confusion, and vomiting.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is a routine 1 hour EEG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms.  Patient has bilateral frontotemporal skull defects.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz 40 to 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Lateral rectus eye movement artifact and skull defect, head rocking artifacts were noted in the background.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing an increase in slowing of the background as well as an increase in the amplitude.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, and accentuation of the breach rhythm.  Features of stage 1 sleep include posts.  Brief stage 2 sleep includes posts, vertex waves, and spindles.  In the transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, the breach rhythm  becomes a bit more prominent, and there are rare bursts of slowing seen primarily in the right hemisphere
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A breech rhythm, most prominent in the frontocentral regions in drowsiness.
Rare slowing primarily seen from the right hemisphere in the transition in and out of sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are compatible with a previous craniotomy and surgery.  No epileptiform features were identified.  No previous EEGs are available for comparison.
