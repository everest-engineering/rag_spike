CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old male status post traumatic brain injury due to a seizure related injury. Previous meningioma resection and epilepsy. Evaluate for unresponsiveness and tremulousness of the hands.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Decadron, Tegretol, Truvada, Lovenox, Lisinopril, Atenolol, Zocor, Raltegravir, Timolol
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern noted. Both hemispheres demonstrate a mixture of theta and delta. There is a bit more faster frequency activity at the midline. Arrhythmic delta activity is noted in the right mid temporal region with variability in terms of mid to posterior temporal region. A breech rhythm is noted at T4/C4 with focal spikes. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.
3. Occasional right sharply contoured delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the previous study the day before. No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance and a focal mechanism for seizures.
