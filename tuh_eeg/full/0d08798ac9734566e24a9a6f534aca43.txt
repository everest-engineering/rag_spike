REASON FOR STUDY:  Unclear.
Please note that this recording was only performed for 7 minutes as the patient became abusive and disrespectful to the staff and the recording had to be stopped prematurely.  No charges will be billed to this patient.  However, no EEG will be able to be completed due to her behavior.  In the 7 minutes, it appears to be a normal EEG, although no full interpretation will be given.
