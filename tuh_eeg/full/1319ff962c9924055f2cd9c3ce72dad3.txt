CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 24-year-old, right-handed male with multiple seizures due to non-compliance with medicines.  History of a gun shot wound with a scar in the right parietal region.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Valium, Percocet, and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has no clinical or electrographic seizures.  He seems to be sleeping throughout nearly the entire recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record show a pattern of diffuse beta.  Over the course of the long-term monitoring, the patient is increasingly alert and awake.  The beta frequency decreases.  In addition, subtle focal slowing can be identified with some delta activity from the right posterior temporal region.  A breech rhythm is identified in later portions of the record with beta asymmetry with richer beta frequency activity from the right centrotemporal region, as well as some double phase reversing artifact.  There are brief epochs of wakefulness by the morning of the 19th.
No epileptiform features were identified.
HR:  60 BPM.
