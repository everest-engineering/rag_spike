CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed female with episodes of slowly slumping over, not responding, loss of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic seizure, had shortness of breath during hook up.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl, Lorazepam.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of loss of consciousness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedure only including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep. There was some mild excessive beta seen throughout.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The mild excess beta seen on the EEG may be due to benzos or barbiturate effects.
