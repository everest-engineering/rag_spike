History:	36 year old woman with a single generalized convulsion ~ 2 weeks ago.
Medications:	Xanax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent, and
POSTS and vertex waves are observed.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
