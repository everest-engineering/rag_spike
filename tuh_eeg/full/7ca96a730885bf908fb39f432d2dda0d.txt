CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old male status post anoxic insult on April 14, 2012, now comatose with CT demonstrating cerebral edema.  Intermittent myoclonus on propofol.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern.  The sections of discontinuity may be up to 2 seconds.  There are brief bursts of fast activity and there is a single section of the record with GPEDS. Tactile stimulation does not activate the record. Over the course of the record, without a change in the patient's medications, the EEG is becoming more low voltage and more consistently suppressed, particularly at 8:30 a.m.
HR:    110 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern.
An initial sections with GPEDS.
A pattern with waning cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In the initial sections of the record, twitch artifact was picked up.  This seemed to be fading over the course of the record, but at least on one
occasion it may have been stimulus sensitivity.  These findings are compatible with a severe anoxic encephalopathy.
