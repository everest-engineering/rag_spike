CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old man found down foaming at the mouth with a tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status and seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while he was agitated and not following commands.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  A lot of movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a disorganized slow background with posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6-7 Hz and does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV seen continuously.
Triphasic waves seen intermittently maximally anteriorly.
At times there is frontally contoured sharp transients, but not clearly pathologic sharp waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  However, in this case it is at least partly due to metabolic encephalopathy and/or medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
