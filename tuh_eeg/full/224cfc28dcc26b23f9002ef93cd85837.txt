History:	62 YO MALE W/ SZ DISORDER. PT SEIZED AT HOME AND BROUGHT IN BY
EMS. GRAND MAL SEIZURE WITNESSED BY NURSE IN ED. LENGTH UNSURE
PMHX ETOH, CVA, SEIZURE
Medications:	Protonix, Levetiracetam, Ceftriaxone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Although much of the record captures drowsiness, the background shows a posterior dominant
rhythm of 8-9Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  The alpha rhythm on the right is somewhat
fragmented compared to the left (see below).  Stage I sleep is characterized by slowing of the
posterior dominant rhythm and the appearance of central theta activity.
There is intermittent focal theta (5-6Hz) slowing over the right hemisphere, maximal in the
temporal region.  There are rare right temporal spikes seen maximal at F8-T2-T4.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, rare, right temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporoparietal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21 minute EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to focal slowing
over the right temporal region and spikes in the right anterior to mid-temporal region. Focal slowing
and spikes in the right hemisphere suggest a structural brain lesion with epileptiform potential.
Following a clinical seizure, focal slowing may reflect a post-ictal effect.
