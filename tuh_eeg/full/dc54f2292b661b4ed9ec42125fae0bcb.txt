History:	53 year old woman with new onset episodes of right arm shaking.
Medications:	Lorazepam, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours.  Nursing-initiated event buttons were
correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the
bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Throughout much of the recording the patient is drowsy or in stage II sleep. However, during
maximal awareness, there is an 8-9Hz posterior dominant rhythm seen bilaterally that is reactive to
eye opening.  Stage I-III sleep is seen.
There are rare left frontotemporal sharps waves seen maximal at F7.  No further seizures are seen.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG due to rare left frontotemporal sharp waves. Overall,
compared to the previous 48 hours, this record has improved with cessation of seizures.  These
findings were conveyed to the primary team.
