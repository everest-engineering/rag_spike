REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 71-year-old man with a history of a stroke, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF, gout and anxiety who presents with right upper extremity shaking for 15 minutes, then right hand weakness with a previous left MCA and pontine stroke, as well as bilateral basal ganglia strokes.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Seroquel, aspirin, Diovan, carvedilol, mirtazapine, Crestor, Protonix, heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead electrocardiogram electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 while in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal sharp waves and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related to epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the left frontotemporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontotemporal region, which may be due to a known stroke.  No seizures were seen.
