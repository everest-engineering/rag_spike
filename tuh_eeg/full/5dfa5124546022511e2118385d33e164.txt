CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old male status post a brain tumor resection in childhood, status epilepticus March 23, 2013 associated with cerebritis/stroke.  This is an awake and drowsy record in a cooperative patient.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The right hemisphere includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates some underlying focal slowing in the left posterior temporal region with a breach rhythm, accentuation of amplitude in that region, some underlying delta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.
In the context of a breach rhythm, there is an underlying, P3/T5 sharp waves, primarily noted at P3.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation produces some bilateral slowing.  Frontally predominant rhythmic theta was noted in hyperventilation.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing noted from both hemispheres, the left more so than the right.
Subtle underlying delta noted in the left hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant.
Breach rhythm.
Subtle underlying left parietal sharp waves in the context of a breech rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual with a structural lesion and previous status epilepticus, this EEG is improved compared to other studies.  The patient is clearly awake with a well-formed alpha rhythm on the right, although it is a bit slow.  The focal features described above are compatible with the patient's known structural abnormality.  No seizures were recorded.
