SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY : 08/28/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Outpatient EEG TYPE:95810
HISTORY:
34 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for recurrent seizures, now monthly
MEDICATIONS :
Current Outpatient Prescriptions Medication Sig
TRAMADOL HCL (TRAMADOL PO) Take	by mouth.
ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE (AMBIEN PO) Take	by mouth.
oxycodone-acetaminophen	(PERCOCET) 5-325 mg per tablet
ALPRAZOLAM (XANAX PO) Take 0.5 mg by mouth every evening.
GABAPENTIN PO Take 600 mg by mouth 3 times daily.
montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg tablet Take 10 mg by mouth nightly .
Lamotrigine (LAMICTAL STARTER, ORANGE, KIT) 25 mg (42) -100 mg (7) Tablets, Dose Pack ?  Ran out
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: none
TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically record and included a single channel of EKG, HV stimulation .
using the was performed satisfactory and photic
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, anterior spread then attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with limited sleep: synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles	present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present. ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :
Hyperventilation: symmetric modest increase in theta
Photic Stimulation : scant driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
