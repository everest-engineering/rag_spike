CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old man with previous left cerebral peduncle and
thalamic infarct, now with episodes of spasm on the right hemibody, right leg radiating
to arms, without apparent awareness.
MEDICATIONS: Furosemide, Gemfibrozil, Insulin, Metoprolol, Sertraline, Simvastatin,
Valsartan, Warfarin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not
possible. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
10.7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Early in wakefulness there is a small degree of
disorganization and a small amount of background theta, particularly in the frontal
central regions. There is very slight asymmetry with a bit more slowing in the left
hemisphere compared to the right, particularly with drop out of faster frequency activity
as the patient becomes drowsy. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small degree of background disorganization.
2. Scant amount of excess theta (slowing).
3. Subtle asymmetry with occasional slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This findings are less prominent than they were in
previous records. None of this individuals previous EEGs have identified epileptiform
activity.
