CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old left-handed male with a 3-year history of epilepsy, none in the last 5 months, but now with eyes shifting while he is talking to his wife.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Adderall, thiamine, pravastatin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record and the patient is initially quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation and drowsiness both produced slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.  Hyperventilation produces slowing as described above.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically acceptable normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
