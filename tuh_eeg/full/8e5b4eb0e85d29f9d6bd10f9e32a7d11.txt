History:	60 year old woman with progressively worsening mental status.

Medications:	No sedation since last pm approx. 6:30, fentanyl, midazolam, Vecuronium

Sedation:

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG

electrodes, lethargic

Description:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low

voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of

frequencies.  Occasional brief (~1 second) periods of background discontinuity are noted.  Diffuse,

frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.

These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was

present but periods of quiescence were captured.

No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an

irregular rate.

Summary of Findings:

Cardiac arrhythmia

Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate

Triphasic waves, intermittent

Interpretation:

This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute portable EEG because of intermittent triphasic waves and

moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse

encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  The lack

of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  A

single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular rate.
