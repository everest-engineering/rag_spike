CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old woman with 1 year history of headache and vertigo.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of stage I and stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles as well as some rhythmic background slowing.  Posts were also noted.  Stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for age.
Clinical correlation.  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This patient transitions rapidly in and out of sleep which may represent either a sleep deprived patient or a patient with an underlying sleep disturbance.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
