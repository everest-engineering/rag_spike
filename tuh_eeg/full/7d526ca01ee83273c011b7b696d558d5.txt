Medications:	Lasix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 7 Hz was present.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90 and irregular  Technical
difficulties: This is a very limited EEG due to continuous muscle and movement artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited EEG in wakefulness only because of diffuse background slowing and
slowing of the alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
