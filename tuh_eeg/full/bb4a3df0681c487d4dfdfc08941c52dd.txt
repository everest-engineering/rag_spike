LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 18.  Last event was approximately 1 week ago.  Seizures are described as head thrashing with associated tongue biting and urinary incontinence.  The patient had head trauma in June 2012.  She also reports migraines.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra, Remeron, Synthroid.  Clonidine was stopped 1 week ago.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was  performed.  Photic stimulation was attempted but stopped prematurely as per patient request due to patient having a migraine.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness symmetrical vertex waves are captured.  The patient's sleep is very brief and symmetrical sleep spindles are observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation is stopped early due to patient request.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Very brief stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and very briefly asleep 22-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
