REASON FOR STUDY:  Dizziness and syncope.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman with a history of stroke 20 years ago and right-sided weakness, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, complains of dizziness, syncope and weakness, profuse sweating for 2-3 months; last episode was 1 week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Lotrel, Diovan, Catapres, Coreg, hydralazine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact in the temporal region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Infrequent focal slowing seen at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  48.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
