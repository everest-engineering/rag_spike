History:	71 YEAR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. WITH AORTIC STENOSIS A FIB, HTN,DA
NOW WITH CHG IN MENTAL STATUS ALSO.
Medications:	GABAPENTIN, PERCOCET, LASIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
The waking background reveal a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7Hz  Background
activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There are rare frontally maximal sharp
waves with triphasic morphology are present.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slowing of the alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
