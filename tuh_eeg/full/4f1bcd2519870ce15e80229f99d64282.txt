CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung transplant patient with history of breast cancer, hyponatremia and confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Bactrim, prednisone, folate, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is recorded wearing a face mask.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates  a low voltage, relatively slow pattern.  There is excess background theta and intermittent growth of FIRDA.  As the patient drifts into sleep vertex waves are observed as is an increase in beta.  In addition, late bursts of FIRDA and irregular slow arrhythmic data are more prominent.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:   Markedly abnormal electroencephalogram due to slow background. CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or
metabolic encephalopathy as well as a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to other causes.
