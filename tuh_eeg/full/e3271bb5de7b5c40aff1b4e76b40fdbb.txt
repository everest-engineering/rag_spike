History:	68 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND UNRESPONSIVE WITH ? SZ,
HYPOGLYCEMIA. PMHX SIG FOR STAGE 4 LUNG CA, COPD IDDM. PRIOR
EEG/LTM. EEG TO R/O SZ/STATUS.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse  very
low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
There is an asymmetry of activity, with a lower amplitude over the left hemisphere.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was mild muscle reactivity to
painful stimuli.  Hr was 102
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, marked, left hemispheric, Worse attenuation on the left
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked diffuse, Diffuse attenuation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The diffuse attenuation seen points to a diffuse cortical damage and asymmetry suggests that it the
cortical dysfunction may be worse on the left.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
