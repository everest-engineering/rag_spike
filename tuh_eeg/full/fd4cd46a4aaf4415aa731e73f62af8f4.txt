History:	24 YR.OLD R HANDED IN MVA ON SAT PTS SAYS HE FELL ASLEEP. NO
HISTORY OF SEIZURE.55 CM HEAD
Medications:	None.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  REM sleep was noted.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at T5 during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, few, left temporal, posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  Please note that REM sleep was captured during a routine EEG which
may represent a sleep disturbance, clinical correlation is required.
