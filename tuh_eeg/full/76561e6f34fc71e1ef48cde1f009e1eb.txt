History:	27 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF 1 SZ. WITH SUBSEQUENT. FIND OF BRAIN TUMOR.
RESECTED 2009 FOLLOWED BY RADIATION.  CHECK UP.  (PRIOR AT COOPER
HOSP).  PT STILL WITH CC OF HEADACHES,  PER WIFE HAS EPISODES OF
SHAKING AND MOUTH BITING 2-3 X EVERY NIGHT. PRESENTS NOW F

CETIRIZINE, TOPIRAMATE, ALBUTEROL, XANAX, PERCOCET, TRAMADOL,
VICODIN, DIVALPROEX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Asymmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions with slightly higher amplitude over  the left.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Spindles are more prominent over the left frontal hemisphere.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present in the left frontal region, with
phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F3. At times they become rhythmic while in sleep.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left frontal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left frontal, Seen best in sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontal, with associated breach
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
in the left frontal region and continuous focal slowing.  These findings  are consistent with the
known tumor resection and a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy.
