PMHX: AID / HIV, ALPHA-THALASSEMIA TRAIT, ESOPHAGITIS, MENINGITIS,
Medications:	KEPPRA, ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 6.5 hours from 05/10/ 2014 to 05/112014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  All automatically detected events
were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
