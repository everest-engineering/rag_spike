CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman with Bell's palsy and 1 year history of left facial twitching with psoriasis.
MEDICATIONS:  Atarax, Singulair, Combivent, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the laboratory using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was  performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred because of the patient's asthma.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Rare, isolated bursts of isolated theta or delta were noted as the patient becomes drowsy.
A twitch monitor was placed on the left face and identified intermittent, twitch artifact from the left facial muscle.  Photo stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in  wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  The muscle twitch monitor was able to capture the typical symptoms that this patient was experiencing.
