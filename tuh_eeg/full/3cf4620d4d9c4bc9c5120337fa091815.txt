CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 74-year-old woman with epilepsy, history of stroke, brain tumor, and demented admitted with recurrent seizures, intubated, sedated, and had an EEG monitoring for persistent unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is initiated on December 25 at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate a markedly slow record.  Although there is some artifact noted as the patient moves around a bit, the overall pattern is a bilaterally slow pattern with some shifting slowing and some central beta.
Stimulation of the patient produces both some artifact, but an increase in faster frequency activity as well.  There is variability in the record, some sections of the record demonstrate some theta.  Both hemispheres are slow, but at times the cerebral activity is a bit more attenuated on the right compared to the left.
As the recording continues the patient is a bit more active, although she remains overall quite somnolent.  There is an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity in the background.  In addition, the patient seems to be scratching off some of her electrodes as the recording continues.
Heart rate:  104 to 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A pattern with initial marked background slowing.
Overall an improvement to a pattern not quite as slow, although still significantly slow.
Focal slowing from the right, most notable in the initial sections of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded and there were no epileptiform features noted in this EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be considered.  Of note, this patient had a previous EEG which also demonstrated background slowing, but no epileptiform activity.
