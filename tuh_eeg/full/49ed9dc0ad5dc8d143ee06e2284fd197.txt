:
History:	59 year old woman admitted with a change in mental status.
Medications:	No AEDs listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 7.5-8 Hz theta activity that
attenuates with eye opening.  There is expected AP gradient with faster frequencies at lower
amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  Patient remains awake throughout
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a minimally abnormal  awake-only 21-minute portable EEG due to slow posterior dominant
rhythm. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
