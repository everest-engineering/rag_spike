History:	73 YR OLD MALE R HANDED. PT WAS IN HOSPITAL FOR A FALL IN NOV. IN
WHICH HE HAD A SUBDURAL  AND THEN BEGAN TO HAVE SEIZURES. PT.
REPORTS NO SEIZURES SINCE HE HAS LEFT TEMPLE. 61 CM HEAD.  F/U EEG

Medications:	WELLBUTRIN, KLONOPIN, KEPPRA, MVI, PHENYTOIN, CRESTOR, ZOLOFT,
FLOMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the  left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
