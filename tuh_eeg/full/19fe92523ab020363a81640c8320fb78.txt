HISTORY:  57year old man with history of TIA and stroke with right sided weakness. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes,  and cardiac stents.   Indication is for rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Plavix,  ASA, Methimazole,  Coreg, Diovan, Allopurinol, Carvedilol, Lantus, Metformin, Novolog, Plavix, Zocor.
MEDICATIONS: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG shows asymmetry. There was a shifting slowing bilaterally with theta and delta waves on the left. There was low amplitude on the left and some muscle artifact on the right. There was a suggestion of higher amplitude on the right. There is also double phase reversals on the right. The background rhythm reaches about 7Hz.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:	84 bpm
HR: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Occasional shifting slowing.
2. 	Amplitude asymmetry.
3.	Increased right hemisphere amplitude.
4. 	Some head rocking signs suggestive of cranial deformity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no spikes or epileptiform activity. However, with increased right sided amplitude,  clinical correlation is suggested.
