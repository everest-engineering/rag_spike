History:	27 year old man who presented with generalized status epilepticus, currently remains intubated and poorly responsive.
Medications:	CEFTRIAXONE, LORAZEPAM DRIP; Depakote Load Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose, photic


Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity is characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with overriding diffuse 12-14 Hz activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.   No normal sleep architecture is present, however, periods of quiescence are evident.

No focal slowing is present. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing,  polymorphic, severe Beta, excessive
No electrographic seizures

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that, in this patient, at least partially related to the medication effect. Excess beta activity could be secondary
to the medications, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No electrographic seizures are present.
