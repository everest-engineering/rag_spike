CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 73-year-old woman with multiple strokes, recent silent stroke, and cortical blindness, admitted after an episode of unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, baclofen, Prozac, pravastatin, Coumadin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a somewhat technically challenging EEG for a confused patient who had difficulty relaxing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG was medium amplitude with suggestion of 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which at times was asynchronous, but can be identified from either occipital region.  Although there was a fair amount of muscle artifact in the background, shifting slowing was noted primarily in the posterior regions, right or left.
Occasional bursts of more rhythmic delta were noted from the left hemisphere with left centrotemporal maximum.
Heart rate 100 to 150 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to;
Medium amplitude, somewhat generalized slow pattern.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Occasional posterior bursts of slowing, right or left.
Rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing from the left.
No epileptiform features were identified.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features identified above may be correlated with imaging.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of use.  This patient had markedly irregular heart rate, which may have contributed to the episode of loss of consciousness.
