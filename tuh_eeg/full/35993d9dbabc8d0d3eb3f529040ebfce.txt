RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: No additional seizures were noted in this portion of the record.  In wakefulness, there is intermittent background theta.  The patient continues to pick at her electrodes and the overall quality for the search for interictal spikes is limited.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal video EEG monitoring due to:
A single complex partial seizure. Review of the behavior associated with the seizure would suggest that the seizure emanates from the left hemisphere.  Scalp EEG is difficult to localize, but actually would localize the seizure to the right hemisphere.
Non-epileptic behaviors including hyperventilation, which may or may not have been related to an emotional process versus underlying asthma or other processes as well as intermittent staring with an angry expression on her face, which appeared to be behavior.
Interictal sharp waves identified, left greater than right. These were overall rare and identified only in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is diagnostic of a partial mechanism for epilepsy, as well as other behaviors without EEG change.
