CLINICAL HISTORY:  41 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 26.  The seizures began with a funny smell, then her mouth waters and then tonoclonic activity.  She also notes a feeling like needles sticking her in her head.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zoloft, Flexeril
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this EEG demonstrates a 10.5 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Eye flutter is noted. In relaxed wakefulness, accentuated by hyperventilation there is very subtle, arrhythmic theta noted in the left temporal region.  In addition, there are discrete temporal sharp waves followed by left temporal focal slowing late in hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation is performed immediately after hyperventilation and produces a bilateral driving response.  Drowsiness is recorded following hyperventilation.  The patient really is not provided much of an opportunity to fall asleep.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic left frontotemporal and frontocentral theta accentuated by hyperventilation.
Discrete left frontotemporal sharp waves noted in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although this EEG continues to demonstrate some asymmetries in eye movement artifact and there is some normal variant such as
rhythmic theta in drowsiness, there is also some irregular slowing and more well-defined sharp waves supporting a focal mechanism for this patient's seizures.
