HISTORY:
79-year-old woman with breast cancer admitted with urosepsis, found to have a right frontal infarct and recurrent seizures,
now poorly responsive but responsive.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of
EKG. The patient was intubated in the ICU. This is a bedside requested.
DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND:
Background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern. On the left hemisphere, there is a continuous pattern with
a mixture of alpha and theta frequency activity. The right hemisphere demonstrates right frontal arrhythmic delta activity
with the polyspike component. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response. Use of Ativan produces
background slowing and blunting of the PLED. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal.
The epileptiform activity is high amplitude with a generous field of spread, but it has a very characteristic. Periodicity 0.8
Hz and does not evolve. With the use of Ativan, the epileptiform discharge decreases in amplitude, but the periodicity is
not affected. The use of Ativan does, however, produce slowing in the contralateral hemisphere.
Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
1 Abnormal EEG due to marked slowing in the right frontal region.
2. Periodic epileptiform activity 1n the right frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are congruent with the patient's stroke. No clinical seizures were noted. The PLED'S represent an
epileptiform focus which may be a late ictal or post ictal sign. Because of th1s LTM was Initiated.
