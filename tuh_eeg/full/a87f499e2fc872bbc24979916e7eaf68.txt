CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old man with hypertension, heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, presented with acute shortness of breath, upper abdominal pain, noncompliant with medications and acute decompensation of CHF.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Midazolam, Fentanyl, Lasix, ASA, Coumadin, Vancomycin, Mycamine, Folic Acid.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm, frontocentral beta or sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In this case, it may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
