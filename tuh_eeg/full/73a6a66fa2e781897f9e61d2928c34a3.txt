Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left much more
than right) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal (left much more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No electrographic seizures are present.
