History: 54 YR FEMALE, SZS. PMHX OF SZS AGE 11 HEAD TRAUMA. OM, B/L CVA FRONTAL L>R, HLD. HTN. PT NON COMPLIANT TO MEDS 11/10/2013 FEU WHILE DANCING. PT WAS INTOXICATED UNCLEAR LOC.
Medications: None mentioned
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10Â·20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
Alpha rhythm of 9Hz and background activity are low voltage (10-25uV). but show normal reactivity to eye opening and attenuate with drowsiness. During drowsiness. The background slows to central theta activity. Frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity Is present in the right mid and anterior temporal region. Occasional focal harp waves are present in the right anterior temporal region with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F8/T4.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal
Sharp waves, occasional, right temporal. anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of epileptiform discharges In the right anterior temporal region. These findings are Indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus In this region. And given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy. No clinical or electrographic seizures are seen
