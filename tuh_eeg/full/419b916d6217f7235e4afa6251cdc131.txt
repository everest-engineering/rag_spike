CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old woman found with V-fib arrest on September 16 for
30 minutes. Past history of hypertension and drug abuse. Evaluate for encephalopathy.
Midazolam, Plavix, ASA
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated, comatose,
and appears unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a variable pattern.
Some portions are very slow, suppressed, slightly discontinuous with a bit more slow
periodic activity on the right. Other portions demonstrate a more continuous pattern of
theta. There is some jerking of the head but without an epileptiform signature. In some
cases the jerking of the head seems to function as an arousal with an increase in theta
frequency activity. Tactile stimulation is not specifically documented in this record.
HR: 100 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A markedly slow background record, 9 days post cardiac arrest.
2. Intermittently discontinuous pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The head jerking does not carry an EEG signature. These
findings support a severe encephalopathy following cardiac arrest. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a more prolonged tracing might be considered. In addition, a
tracing with documentation of the patient's exam would also be helpful.
