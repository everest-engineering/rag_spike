CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system, additional T1 and T2 electrodes  and a single EKG  lead .  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 74-year-old woman with progressive decline in mental status over the last several days.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include vancomycin and Zofran.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency-amplitude gradient .  During maximal wakefulness the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta.  Additional intermittent triphasic wave forms with anterior to posterior lag are captured.  During periods of quiescence, brief periods of discontinuity are captured.  No normal sleep architecture is observed .  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate of approximately 120 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Occasional background discontinuity.
Triphasic wave forms.
Cardiac arrhythmia and tachycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, periods of discontinuity and occasional triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology, but could be related to toxic metabolic causes .  Triphasic wave forms are observed in various forms of encephalopathy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate with a rate of approximately 120 beats per minute.  No clear electrographic  seizures were captured.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology resident on call at the time of dictation.
