CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, breakthrough seizure last month when she was anemic.  Seizures include complex partial seizures with a dizzy feeling, automatisms and unresponsive for 10 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Valsartan, Cyproheptadine, Albuterol, Tiotropium, Nicolette (?)
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient's itchiness produces a great deal of muscle artifact.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha, rhythmic theta and rare bursts of shifting slowing.  There is prominent eye movement artifact in wicket, but no definitive sharp waves and spikes. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    110 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed to characterize
her epileptiform activity, a follow-up study with sleep is suggested.  The use of a medication to reduce itching might be valuable.
