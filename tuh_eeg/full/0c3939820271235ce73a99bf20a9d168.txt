History:	29 year old woman who became progressively less responsive today during
hemodialysis.
Medications:	sedation used for intubation and propofol that is now stopped
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~15 hours from 11/9/2015 to 11/10/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation, the background consists of  moderate amplitude
slow delta activity.  During periods of quiescence, faster frequencies appear.  No normal sleep
architecture is captured.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~120-130 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL nearly 15 hour continuous video  EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~120-130 bpm.
