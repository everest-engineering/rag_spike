INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and super-harmonic driving.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. During photic stimulation, this patient reported that she felt as if she was to have a seizure but the EEG was normal. There were no pathologic features identified.
