CLINICAL. HISTORY: 84 year old right handed male status post evacuation of subdural

hematoma. He also has a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He is
status post subdural hematoma identified 3/2212011.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Plavix, Gabapentin, Lipitor.
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a diffusely slow
pattern with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta. There are some sections with in the
morning slow, arrhythmic delta activity. Prominent shifting and slowing is noted. There is
an amplitude asymmetry with at times higher amplitude activity in the left compared to
the right. There is a fair amount of variability
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. An occasional amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity
CLINICAL. CORRELATION: Despite the history of a new lateral, subdural hematoma,
this EEG supports a bihemispheric process. The amplitude asymmetry, however, can
correlate with the subdural hematoma.
