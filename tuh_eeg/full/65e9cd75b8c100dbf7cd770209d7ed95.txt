CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient with right ear pain, vertigo, and an episode of clenching in association with the procedure.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, verapamil, aspirin, and Topamax, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This was an awake and a sleep, bedside record with acceptable impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes noted in stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 55 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a followup study may be obtained.
