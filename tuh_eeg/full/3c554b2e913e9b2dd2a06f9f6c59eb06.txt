History:	55 year old female with hx of epilepsy, onset 10 yrs ago. pt had a generalized sz in may 2014
pmhx: high cholesterol, anxiety, sz, gerd, arthritis
Medications:	Phenobarb, Keppra, Zocor, Lorazepam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuated the focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
