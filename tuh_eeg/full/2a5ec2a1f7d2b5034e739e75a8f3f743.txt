LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes and 55 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient history:  The patient is a 47-year-old man with past medical history of seizures since childhood.  Last seizure occurred in August of 2012.  Seizures are characterized as generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  MRI of the brain shows encephalomalacia/gliosis in the right parietal lobe consistent with chronic infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications:  Coumadin, Keppra, Lamictal, Tylenol, Motrin, Prilosec.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9 to 10 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and rare vertex waves are captured. Hyperventilation produces mild, diffuse background slowing.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
No focal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy nearly 24 minutes EEG.   No epileptiform discharges are captured; however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizure still persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
