CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed woman with 2 episodes of loss of consciousness in October 2011.  She stood up, stretched, felt weak/lightheaded, and had motor movements of body with her head folding in.  These symptoms lasted 30 seconds.  She was disoriented afterward.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was to have been a sleep-deprived EEG, but it was not.  It is a conventional 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.  There are occasional hypersynchronous rhythmic discharges, compatible with hypnagogic hypersynchrony.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, producing a posterior predominant hyperventilation response.  In addition, there is some sharply contoured activity with a handful of sharp waves in the right centrotemporal and posterior temporal region noted in hyperventilation.  This was followed by a transition to sleep with brief attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony characterizes the drowsy state.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A posterior predominant hyperventilation response in an adult of this age.
The appearance of right central and posterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  If additional information is needed, a repeat study perhaps with physiological testing may be helpful to more completely understand the spells that this patient has been experiencing.
