CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old woman with advanced HIV disease found unresponsive and in respiratory distress.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Xanax, Percocet,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is responsive to stimuli. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with a 6Hz theta frequency background, shifting slowing and prominent frontal beta. In this challenging ER record, there is a bit more frontal beta on the right than the left. There are a handful of sharp waves noted in the left posterior central region and right mid temporal region.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Theta frequency background.
2. Generalized slowing.
3. Independent sharp waves identified from the right or left hemisphere, right temporal, left central parietal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. No seizures were recorded. The EEG demonstrates that the patient is much more awake and responsive than might have been anticipated based on her clinical exam.
