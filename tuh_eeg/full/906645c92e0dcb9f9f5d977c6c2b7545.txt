History: 83 year old man who presents with a stroke symptoms. No AEDs listed
Medications: None
EEG Type: Awake & asleep, portable
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 8 Hz theta activity. AP gradient is present. Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  Symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Stage II sleep is brief.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of - 72 bpm, irregular with occasional inter-ORS pauses up to 1.5 seconds.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2 Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and briefly asleep, due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of - 72 bpm, irregular with occasional inter-ORS pauses up to 1.5 seconds.
