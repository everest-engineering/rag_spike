History:	66 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P PEA CODE ON 6/14/14 X 16 MIN.
NEURO CONSULTED FOR NOTED RT GAZE DEV. B/L LEG TWITCHING,
STIMULUS INDUCED MYOCLONUS.
Medications:	DOPAMINE, VANCOMYCIN, VASOPRESSIN, EPINEPHRINE, NOREPINEPHRINE,
PHENYLEPHRINE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
suppression of all activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84 irregular.  There was a frequent muscle/ movement artifact
seen with the patient head movement on video, however there was no clear cerebral electrographic
correlate to the movements.
Summary of Findings:
Other, suppression of cerebral activity.
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background suppression and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  In the setting of hypoxic injury and absence of sedation this findings forebode a poor
