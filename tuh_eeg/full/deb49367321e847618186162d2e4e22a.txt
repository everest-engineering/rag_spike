CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 65-year-old male, evaluated shortly following V-tach arrest. The patient was resuscitated and had chest compressions.  Evaluate mental status.
I NTRODUCTION: This bedside portable, digital video EEG was recorded in 2 pieces for a total duration of 90 minutes. This is a technically challenging record due to muscle artifact.  Ativan was given to reduce muscle artifacts.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Coumadin, Keppra, vitamin B12, and Ativan.
Description of Record : The initial sections of the record demonstrates a diffuse theta pattern with intermittent bursts of irregular delta. The patient is uncomfortable and awake with eye movement artifact. There is intermittent slowing with more irregular delta in the posterior regions. The first section of the record is 40 minutes in duration.  Second section of the record is greater than 45 minutes in duration and follows the use of Ativan.  Following the Ativan, the patient seemed to be a bit more awake with eye opening, is a bit calmer.  EEG demonstrates primarily a mixed theta delta pattern.
HR: 72 BPM
IMPRESSION: Technically challenging but abnormal due to:
Background slowing
Background  disorganization
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a nonspecific pattern supportive of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Acutely cardiac arrest, this pattern is a positive prognostic pattern. No seizures were seen
