CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male with altered mental status and aphasia
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring. The patient is calm and cooperative. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a background with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Generous background beta and arrhythmic delta is picked up in the left hemisphere, particularly the left centrotemporal. A left temporal and sometimes central parietal sharp wave is noted. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
3. Disorganization.
4. Focal slowing in the left hemisphere.
5. Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates an overall improved background. No seizures were recorded. Additional clinical evaluation may be appropriate.
