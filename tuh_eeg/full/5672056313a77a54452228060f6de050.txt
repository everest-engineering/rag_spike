History:	29 YR MALE TRANSFERRED FROM VA IMPACT CENTER FOR CHANGE IN MS
AND UE/LE ABNORMAL  MOVEMENTS.  PT DX WITH COMPARTMENT
SYNDROME. HEROINE ADDICT.
Medications:	5/18 GABAPENTIN, NARCAN, COGENTIN, 5/19 BENADRYL, LORAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background  reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9Hz.  Excessive
symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Very frequent delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region.  Frontal intermittent
rhythmic delta seen (FIRDA).  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60  During the EEG the patient
exhibits intermittent irregular right leg jerking movement with no EEG correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent temporal, anterior
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), marked
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent anterior temporal
focal slow and FIRDA. These findings are suggestive of focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
are non-specific with regards to etiology.  The episodic leg jerks have no EEG correlate and as such
may represent non-epileptic events or alternately may simple parietal seizures which do not have an
EEG correlate in up to 75% of cases.
