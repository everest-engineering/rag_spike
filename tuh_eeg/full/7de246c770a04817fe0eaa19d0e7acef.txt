CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old right handed woman, 22 weeks pregnant with seizure, loss of consciousness.  Brief 1 minute event.  Past history of drug dependence.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone, Multivitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized.  There is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, but there are bursts of rhythmic theta and at times the alpha rhythm is slower at 7 Hz.  Brief alerting just prior to hyperventilation produces an increase in organization of the background.  Hyperventilation is associated with head rocking artifact.
At the close of hyperventilation, there are some bursts of finally predominant, hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing, but these bursts do not have spike and wave activity associated with them.  Features of drowsiness include again hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing and handful of vertex waves.  Photic stimulation does elicited a driving response particularly a factor frequency activity.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background disorganization.
Bursts of hypersynchronous rhythmic theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse CNS process which can be medication related.  There is focal artifact noted in the right occipital region.  If seizures are an important consideration for this individual, a follow-up study as an outpatient is suggested.
