History:	47 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH RUPTURED LEFT ICA ANEURYSM
Medications:	PROPOFOL, NICARDIPINE, VECURONIUM
MEDS IN ER PROPOFOL/ VECURONIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
The background was diffusely slow with intermixed alpha and excess beta activity and intermittent
periods of diffuse attenuation.  At 2:59 PM the first coil was employed. At 3:18 PM the last coil was
employed. There were no associated EEG changes.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing was noted.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 75-100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, No asymmetric EEG changes during study were noted.
Interpretation:
This was an uneventful EEG during cerebral angiogram and coil placement. There was evidence
of intermittent attenuation and diffuse slowing may have been related to medication effect or
blood pressure changes. These findings were conveyed to the primary team during procedure.
