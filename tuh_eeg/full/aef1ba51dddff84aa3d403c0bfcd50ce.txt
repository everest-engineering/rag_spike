History:	57 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O 2 EPISODES OF LOC/ DIZZINESS-
VERTIGO  LASTING APPROX 1 MIN. PMHX SIG FOR HLD, OA, OSTEOPORSIS,
DM, VERTIGO
Medications:	none
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
right posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
