CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed male with epilepsy with tonic-clonic activity, postictal confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was declined by the patient, but photic stimulation was concluded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In relaxed wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of background theta. As the patient drifts into sleep, there is an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG to due to:
I. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were performed. This EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
