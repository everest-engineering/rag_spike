History:	72 year old man with extensive PMH, now presents with change in mental status
and a low  blood sugar.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal, the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background is
characterized by a mixture of moderate voltage theta and delta activity.  Patient rapidly transitions
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 24-min EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this case
likely related to an excessively drowsy patient, given the fact that he rapidly transitions between
arousals and drowsiness.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
