CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old woman with left aneurysm clip craniotomy, seizure
free for 2 years. Depression and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes a drowsy state with
generous beta. A breach rhythm is identified in the left frontocentral region. In addition, occasional left temporal rhythmic focal slowing and sharp waves are noted in both wakefulness, hyperventilation, and drowsiness. These are discrete and can be
differentiated from the patient's EKG artifact. Scant wakefulness includes a symmetric reactive posterior dominate rhythm.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the patient's 4th EEG. The 2006 study
demonstrated both focal slowing and sharp waves, although the follow-up EEGs
demonstrated only focal slowing, focal delta. The individual remains seizure free, but
these findings support a localized mechanism for epilepsy.
