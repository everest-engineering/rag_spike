Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring in the EMU was performed for 20 hours from 03/14/2014
to03/15/2014.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.     All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by  the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	5
Description of pushbutton events

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves and POSTs.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
72  Had 5 push buttons in which she complained of perceiving a burning smell. On one spell she
was slow to follow commands but alert. No EEG changes were seen during this time.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 20 HOURS EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The five spells had no EEG
correlate.  However, only ~25% of simple partial seizures are captured on a scalp EEG.
