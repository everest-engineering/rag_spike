REASON FOR STUDY:  Status epilepticus.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old man found down with status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta.  The patient is recorded mainly in drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
SEIZURES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The excessive beta noted may be at least in part due to benzodiazepines or barbiturate use.
