CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 33-year-old woman with recurrent syncopal episodes while smoking.  Lightheadedness and collapse.  The patient experiences these 4-5 times per month, and recently had a jaw fracture.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  Twenty minutes digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was uncomfortable with some jaw and facial movements.  This is a primarily awake record with hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation was difficult to achieve given the patient's facial problems.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This 20-minute digital video EEG recording at the bedside was unremarkable, within normal limits in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study when the patient is more comfortable may be of value.
