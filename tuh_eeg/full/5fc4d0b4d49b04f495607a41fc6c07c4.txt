History:	40 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SZ.  PER PT INCREASE IN SZS.   ONSET IN 3/14.
LEFT EYE BRUISE FROM SZ LAST WK.  NOTE PT WITH HAIR WEAVE NO FZ,
CZ, PZ AND ELECTRODES ESTIMATED'
Medications:	Librium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 90
Technical difficulties: 1. There were no Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes and placements were estimated
due the patient wearing a hair weave, .2. Excess EMG/myogenic artifact  There were prominent
eye movements, which at times appear slightly nystagmoid.
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
