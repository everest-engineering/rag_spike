Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Please note that the patient has
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Excessive or inappropriate sleep patterns
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of excessive theta in wakefulness
and short sleep latency.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
