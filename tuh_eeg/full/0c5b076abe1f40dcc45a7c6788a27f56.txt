CLINICAL HISTORY:

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, others.


HISTORY:  A 48-year-old woman who had an unusual episode while working the night shift. She has the history of back pain but had an episode where she was confused, her face was twisted. She drove home from work and had a transient feeling of left-sided weakness.  MRI negative for acute stroke. Date of symptoms 7 days prior to this EEG.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was an afternoon study for a patient who usually works an evening shift.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of wakefulness through a stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.

Photic stimulation did not produce a driving response.  Hyperventilation produced more of a drowsy pattern.

Heart rate 72 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
