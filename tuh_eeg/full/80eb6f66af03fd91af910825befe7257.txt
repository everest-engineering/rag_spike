CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old left handed female with history of seizures, the last one a month ago.  Also, with a history of a prior stroke with left sided weakness and COPD.
MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, Lisinopril, ASA, Geodon, Nebulizer, Temazepam, Xanax.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a high amplitude posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 20 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG due to:
Intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
