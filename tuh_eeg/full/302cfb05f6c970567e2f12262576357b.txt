CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old male with MRSA and arachnoiditis of the lumbar spine.  Previous right foot amputation following MVA, now with intermittent confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Dilaudid, Naprosyn, Flexeril, Neurontin, Cymbalta, ceftriaxone, daptomycin, Benadryl, and others
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was described as both drowsy and jittery at the same time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with features of stage 2 sleep including beta spindles.  Intermittent arousals are noted with grimacing and spontaneous movement.  Frequent POSTS were noted.  An unusual single channel artifact was noted at T3 later in the study.  Stimulation of the patient produce minimal alerting and then the patient drifts off to stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for essentially continuous stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Of note, this patient is having intermittent twitching during stage 2 sleep and consideration for a toxic metabolic or other process may be of value to more completely understand this.
