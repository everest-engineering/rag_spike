History:	60 YR MALE FOLLOW UP EEG PMHX OF CLOSED HEAD INJ BIFRONTAL
ENCEPHALOMALACIA BIFRONTAL BURR  HOLES,  RIGHT TEMP SDH WITH
H/O STATUS EPILEPTICUS.
Medications:	Keppra, Vimpat Abilify, Trazodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
There is intermittent focal delta and theta slowing noted over the left fronto-temporal region.
There are rare left fronto-temporal sharp waves.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) did not induce symmetric photic
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Sharp waves, rare, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to focal slowing and sharp waves over
the left frontotemporal region. These findings support an epileptogenic focus in the left
frontotemporal region associated with a structural brain lesion.
