CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old right handed woman with seizure on September 2010, renal failure, dementia, hepatitis C, history of epileptiform activity on EEG's dating to 2004.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Metoprolol, Levetiracetam, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is rhythmically slow, somewhat disorganized with an overall 6 Hz theta frequency pattern, and shifting arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the occipital regions. Sharply contoured delta is noted in the left hemisphere with
a phase reversal at T1. FIRDA is noted. Occasional muscle twitch artifact is observed. The overall background is relatively high amplitude and it ranges from at times 60 to 90 microvolts. As the patient becomes drowsy, additional focal slowing is identified in the left hemisphere. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A pattern of rhythmic background slowing.
2. FIRDA
3. Occasional sharp waves noted in this record, including C3-T3 and T1.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing in this record is not as prominent as in previous studies. The epileptiform activity is quite subtle in this study. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. A toxic or metabolic encephalopathy may produce the pattern described above. This is particularly important given the history of renal failure. The sharp waves identified on the left have been previously described in other studies.
