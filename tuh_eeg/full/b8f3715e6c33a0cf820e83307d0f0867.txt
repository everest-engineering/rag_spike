CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old male with liver transplant, acute encephalopathy and possible seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Ondansetron, Testosterone, Keppra, Lamictal, Darbepoetin, Advair, Lisinopril, Insulin, Flagyl, Coumadin, Digoxin, Synthroid, Valganciclovir, Protonix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is tremulous. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is compromised by muscle artifact that includes the beta in a slow pattern. Superimposed upon this there is a right occipital sharp wave which is periodic and seen throughout the EEG. As the recording continues, the sharp wave demonstrates variability and may be right occipital maximum or maximum in the central regions. In addition, there are some attempts at horizontal bi pole with a maximum at F4. There is a variability in the record. Some areas of the record demonstrate more beta than others.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. New focal epileptiform activity which may be right occipital or right frontocentral. This activity is periodic in nature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with a previous history of generalized spike and wave activity, this EEG raises concerns about an underlying focal process today.
