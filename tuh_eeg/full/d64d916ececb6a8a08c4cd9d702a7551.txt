MCA, NOW ADMIT WITH H/O FOUND DOWN UNRESPONSIVE/STROKE ALERT
Medications:	PROTONIX, LOVENOX, VALPROIC ACID, OXCARBAZEPINE, LABETALOL, FOLIC
ACID, THIAMINE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Background is characterized by a diffuse muscle and ICU-related artifact intermixed by diffuse beta
and alpha activity with no recognizable posterior dominant rhythm.  Excess diffuse admixed 5-7Hz
activity is present throughout the recording superimposed by faster frequencies.  No normal sleep
architecture is present.
Intermittent slow activity is present in the left temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 70-80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EMG diffuse
Beta diffuse
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Technically limited
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing. These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG and movement
artifact.  If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG with sedation.
