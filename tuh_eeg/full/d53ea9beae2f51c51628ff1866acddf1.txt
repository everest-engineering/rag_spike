REASON FOR STUDY:  Altered mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman discharged from hospital on  with MRSA endocarditis, admitted to Temple after missing three hemodialysis appointments, now remains confused after receiving hemodialysis.  Has a past medical history of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, lupus, MRSA endocarditis in the tricuspid valve, and a sphenoid sinus epidural abscess.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, famotidine, darbepoetin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and poor responsiveness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture, and no activating procedures were performed.  At times, there are some small bursts of beta seen centrally and frontally, but this is not the typical frontocentral beta seen in a normal patient.  Overall, there is diffuse slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There is some focal slowing seen mainly over T4 at frequencies 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-60 microvolts in addition to generalized slowing as described in the previous paragraph.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right temporal focal slowing in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of marked generalized cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology but which may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
