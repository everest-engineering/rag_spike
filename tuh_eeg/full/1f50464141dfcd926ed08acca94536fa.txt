CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed gentleman with severe closed head injury approximately a decade ago. The patient currently has spells where he "browns out," several times per week. These symptoms typically occur under stress.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is a 40 minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm which ranges from 6.5 to 8.5 hertz. There is excess theta. There is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity particularly at T4. This is accentuated by hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Vertex waves and some shifting slowing are noted in stage I sleep as are posts. Rare spindles are noted in stage II sleep . Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION : Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Occasional sharply contoured slowing noted on the right.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing and shifting slowing are similar to previous studies. This sleep deprived record has a slightly slower alpha rhythm than noted 1 year ago that may be due to the patient's incipient drowsiness. The last EEG was in 2008.
