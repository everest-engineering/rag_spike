CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed woman, with past nocturnal tonic clonic
seizures. Seizure-free for many years. The patient had an episode earlier this year
with right sided numbness which she describes as much different than the seizure she
had many years ago. She has hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a relatively low voltage
background with symmetric, reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized
by an increase in theta. There is prominent eye movement artifact. There is a scant
asymmetry noted in the record in hyperventilation. In hyperventilation there is a slight
asymmetry with a very small amount of theta noted in the left temporal region in
comparison to the right. There is also a very slightly asymmetric photic driving
response. Although there is a fair amount of artifact, there is a single, left temporal
sharp wave observed. Wicket activity is also noted on rare occasions. Photic
stimulation otherwise elicits symmetric driving response.
HR: 72 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle abnormal hyperventilation and photic driving response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a small amount of wicket. In that the left
temporal region, sharp wave is only identified on one occasion this must be considered
artifactual. If there are additional episodes of right sided numbness, additional EEG
recording is warranted.
