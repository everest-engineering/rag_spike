CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male, IV drug abuser found with heroine overdose, tonic clonic seizure on February 19, 2010, cardiac arrest sometime between February 19 and February 21, 2010.

MEDICATIONS: Dopamine, Fentanyl, Depakote, Ativan, Lorazepam, Tylenol, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside:using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage beta pattern with muscle artifact. There is a suggestion of some very low voltage theta in the right temporal region, some of which may represent EKG artifact. Stimulation of the patient produces artifact. Occasional spontaneous eye movement is noted.

HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage beta frequency pattern accompanied by significant amounts of muscle.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the low voltage pattern with the amount of muscle described above, consideration for a repeat study using a neuromuscular blocking agent may be appropriate.
