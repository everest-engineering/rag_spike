CLINICAL HISTORY:  84 year old right handed female with bilateral subdural 15 days ago with bur holes, now returned for reaccumulation status post left crania, now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat, Metoprolol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9, which is reactive to eye opening and eye closing.  There is an increased amount of diffuse frontocentral beta.  Wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II, are recorded.  No activating procedures are performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Intermittent left T3 focal slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent left midtemporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this is markedly different from the previous EEG where continuous left focal slowing and focal sharp waves were seen.
