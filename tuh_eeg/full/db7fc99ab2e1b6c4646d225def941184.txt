CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old right handed female with history of high cholesterol and Parkinson's, who presents with TIA and change in mental status with incoherent speech for 3 days.
MEDICATIONS:  Senna, Simvastatin, ASA, Acetaminophen, Sertraline, Midamor.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Sleep stage I was recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG in the delta theta frequencies with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  There is some frontal central beta seen. Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and 20-60 mV in amplitude during wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
