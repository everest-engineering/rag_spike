INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG has a background slowing.  There is also shifting slowing during sleep.  There is a background  alpha rhythm of 7 Hz.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  There is a shifting asymmetry.
HR  :
54 bpm and irregular.
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Shifting slowing.
2.  Shifting asymmetry.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity.   However, the features are nonspecific findings, suggestive more of a toxic encephalopathy  or global disturbance of cerebral function.  Further clinical correlation is recommended.
