REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures, concern for subclinical status due to change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old man with history of mental retardation and cerebral palsy with seizures since the age of 2, recent slowly progressive worsening of seizures and recent admission for status epilepticus complicated with sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, now after discharge remains confused, agitated and not back to baseline.  EEG to rule out subclinical status.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Lamictal, Keppra, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures could not be performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient is agitated and moving throughout the whole recording despite Ativan and despite technical efforts to keep him still, which caused a very poor quality EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Again, this is a limited EEG and the record reveals background consists of no normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta.  Overall there is generalized slowing in the delta frequency and 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  The patient again was agitated throughout the recording.  There was marked muscle artifact and multielectrode artifact throughout the recording.  No epileptiform activity can be seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As stated above, generalized slowing.
HEART RATE:  126.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This very limited EEG due to motion artifact reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No clear seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
