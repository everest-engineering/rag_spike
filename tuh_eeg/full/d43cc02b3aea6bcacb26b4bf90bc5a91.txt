CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old male status post childhood leukemia and meningioma
resection with craniotomy in the occipital region, now with recurrent seizures. Seizures as well
as spells characterized by flashing lights, ocular pain, pressure and dizziness. The patient
reported a seizure 6 weeks prior to the office visit.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were
performed. This is an awake and asleep record. Prominent craniotomy defect is noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG includes a relatively
low voltage pattern. There is a suggestion of an alpha rhythm. There is an amplitude
asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the left with some alpha frequency activity.
Rhythmic theta is observed bilaterally. The most prominent finding in this record are bursts of
extremely high amplitude sharp waves which often occur in clusters. Hyperventilation clearly
produces an accentuation of these very high amplitude discharges. The activity can be as high
amplitude as 800 mcV. As the patient becomes drowsy there is an increase in background
theta. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response, but may also accentuate the
epileptiform activity which is high amplitude, left frontocentral, and ranges from high amplitude
complexes of sharp waves and spike to lower amplitude sharp wave contoured theta in the left
frontocentral region.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude left frontocentral spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave
complexes.
2. Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This EEG is similar to a previous
study and suggests a highly epileptogenic focus.
