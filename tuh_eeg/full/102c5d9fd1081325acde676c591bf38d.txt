CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old woman status post traumatic brain injury 1 month ago, patient reevaluated from traumatic brain rehab for episodes of tachycardia and possible recurrent intercerebral hemorrhage.  The patient is now having tonic posturing, evaluate for seizures.  New hematoma on the right.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has bilateral craniectomies at this time with a left hygroma.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow and relatively featureless.  There is a small amount of faster frequency activity.  There is more variability noted in the record with eye movements and perhaps some faster frequency activity when the patient demonstrates movement.
HR:    150 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous EEGs, this EEG is not significantly changed.  No epileptiform features were identified.  No seizures were
recorded.  Involuntary movements were observed but it was not clear that the involuntary movements observed were the movements in question.
