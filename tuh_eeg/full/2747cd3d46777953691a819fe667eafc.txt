CLINICAL HISTORY: 	81 year old woman with respiratory arrest on September 12,
2009, admitted August 6, 2009.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, Heparin, Insulin, Pantoprazole,  Lipitor, Vanco,  ASA, Cipro, Norepinephrine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab/bedside using standard 10-
20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a quite low voltage, but continuous pattern with significant frontotemporal beta but relative suppression of the beta in the central region and with lower voltage delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle artifact.
HR:	78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Replacement of normal patterns with beta pattern particularly in the frontotemporal regions.
2. 	Low voltage featureless pattern in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This pattern, carries a worrisome prognosis. It would be important  to know if this is the 1st or second potential anoxic insult. There was no reactivity to tactile stimuli and no variability observed.
