HISTORY: 47 year old woman  with dizziness associated with movements of her head.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient declined hyperventilation. Photic simulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief epochs of drowsiness are characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Sleep is not sustained.   Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 	84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were observed.  Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
