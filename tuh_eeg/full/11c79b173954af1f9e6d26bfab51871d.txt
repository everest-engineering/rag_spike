CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old right handed female with episodes that started 6 months ago described as fall with loss of consciousness with associated bladder incontinence and tongue biting, as well as confusion with a headache.  At times prior to the event he says he gets lightening bolts.
MEDICATIONS:  Medications for depression, cannot remember the medications.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  EEG was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well formed 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with an amplitude of 20-60 mV, which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta is seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation do not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Note:  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Prolonged recording with deeper stages of sleep may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
