CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 yea fold male with AVM surgery in the 1990s, left skull
defect, right craniotomy defects as well. Increasing tonic-clonic seizures with
incontinence.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were performed. This was an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite the craniotomy deficits, there is a 9.5 Hz
symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta
activity. There is a little bit of electrode artifact. Drowsiness is characterized by
paroxysmal slowing with vertex wave K complexes and spindles. There are some
paroxysmal irregular bursts in stage II sleep as well as some well-defined vertex waves.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation is
performed while the patient is in stage II sleep.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Some irregular slowing in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed.
