CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old female with chief complaint of COPD exacerbation with a past medical history significant for COPD, anxiety, and chronic pain, questionable lupus, sclerosis, GERD, spinal neural stimulator.  The patient had a change in mental status and was found with urine and fecal incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Lovenox, Ativan, Famotidine, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Solu-Medrol, Gabapentin, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse slow background at 3-5 Hz, not very well reactive to eye opening.  There is a burst of shifting slowing with irregular delta waves throughout the recording.  The patient appeared to go to stage I sleep. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Diffuse slow background at 3-5 Hz.
Bursts of shifting slowing with irregular delta waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slow background.
Bursts of shifting slowing with irregular delta waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen, but this EEG is abnormal due to diffusely slow background which could indicate the toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.  Bursts of shifting slowing could potentially indicate underlying white matter disorders, but it is very nonspecific
