History:	56 YO PWE THE PT SHE HAS PSEUDOSEIZURES. HER LAST EPISODE WAS WEDNESDAY WHEN SHE HAD MULTIPLE SZ. BEFORE THAT HER LAST EPISODE WAS IN 2006. PMH: BIPOLAR, SCHIZOPHRENIC, GERD FAMILY HX : FATHER HAD SZ. PER PT SHE HAD A SZ ON EEG BEFORE AND WAS NEG.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, HALDOL, SYNTHROID, PROTONIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
