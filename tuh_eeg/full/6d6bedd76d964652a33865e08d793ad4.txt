CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old male with rhabdomyolysis and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Thiamin, Folate, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  1 0-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is low amplitude, but there is a well-defined 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation produces bursts of rhythmic paroxysmal slowing, some of which is a little bit more remarkable on the left. Features  of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements  followed by vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles. Toward the close of the record when the patient is awakened for photic stimulation, there is a handful of bursts of slowing on the left. These are also noted in photic stimulation.
HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Left-sided focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features are observed in this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study as an outpatient may be helpful to more completely characterize epileptiform activity.
