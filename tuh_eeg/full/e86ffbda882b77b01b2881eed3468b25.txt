CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of likely complex partial seizures for the last several years who is currently admitted for presurgical evaluation.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, Lyrica 150 mg twice a day, and Seroquel.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Audiovisual capabilities were implemented.  Spike and seizure detectors were implemented.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.  The study was reviewed at least once during the 24 hour recording period.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves, sleep spindles, K complexes, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep are captured.  There is occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity observed over the left temporal region.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  No events observed.  Sinus bradycardia is occasionally captured in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Occasional mild left temporal slowing.
No events.
Occasional sinus bradycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 24-hour audio-video EEG monitoring due to occasional mild left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No typical events were captured.
