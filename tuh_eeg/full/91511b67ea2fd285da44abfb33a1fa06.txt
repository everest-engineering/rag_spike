History:	58 Y/O MALE WITH PMHX OF NIDDM, PVD, HTN, BARRETTS ESOPHAGUS,
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, PT PRESENTS TO HOSPITAL  WITH WEAKNESS AND
DIARRHEA 5 - 6 DAYS. PMHX: HTN, NIDDM, ETOH
Medications:	Insulin, Lorazepam, Lasix, norepinephrine gtt
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There was intermittent periods of discontinuity lasting up to 15seconds.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 110
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked
Attenuation, marked
Discontinuous background, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and marked attenuation and
periods of discontinuity. These findings are suggestive of severe global cerebral dysfunction.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
