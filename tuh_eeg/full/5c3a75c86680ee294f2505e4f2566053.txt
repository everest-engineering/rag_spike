REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy and convulsions, last one on August 7, 2013.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves were seen independently at F7/T3 and at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing at times sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal independent bilateral focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
