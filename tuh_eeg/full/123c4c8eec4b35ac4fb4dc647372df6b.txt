History:	28 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  CHEST PAIN NOW NOTED WITH SZ
ACTIVITY WITH LOC, PT POS. FOR OPIATES AND CANNABINOIDS- PT DENIES
DRUG ABUSE.
Medications:	KEPPRA, TEGRETOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  At times the in wakefulness background is slightly organized
however it rapidly becomes mildly slow (theta) diffusely with intermixed excessive beta.  Diffuse,
frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-
7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
