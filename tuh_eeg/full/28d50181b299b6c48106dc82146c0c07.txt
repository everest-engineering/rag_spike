HISTORY:
63 y .o. female that she started having seizures in 2008. They are characterized by onset of severe fatigue that lasts 15-20 minutes, followed by loss of awareness . She has been told that during loss of awareness she stares. She has gotten lost during these seizures. But she has never injured herself during these events .
She reports that she has not had any Sz for at least 1 yr and would like her driver 's license to be restated.	History of lung cancer and emphysema

SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is slightly asymmetric but reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 7.5Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
Generalized slowing is characterized by slowing of the posterior
dominant rhythm with excess beta noted in wakefulness.
Focal slowing is present.	It is most prominent in drowsiness with left focal slowing as well as an amplitude accentuation. There was no mention of a prior craniotomy defect in the technical assessment
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
In sleep, probably contoured Tl sharp waves are noted.	These are seen the patient has underlying focal slowing
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: Scant photic driving was noted, better elicited on the right
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to:
#1.	focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximal in the temporal
regions, accentuated by drowsiness
#2: Left temporal sharp waves seen primarily in drowsiness, Infrequent
#3: Generalized background slowing the slowing of the alpha rhythm
There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is study supports a focal or structural process in the left hemisphere.	A localization-related mechanism for seizures may be considered.	Careful evaluation of history and imaging is appropriate to exclude breach rhythm craniotomy defect
