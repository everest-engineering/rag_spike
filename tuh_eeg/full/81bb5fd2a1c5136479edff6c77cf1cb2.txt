History:	40 year old man with recurrent syncopal events.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single
EKG lead.  Intermittent brief bursts of 10Hz activity with an arch-shaped morphology occur
independently over the central regions with shifting laterality.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Mu rhythm
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
