CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old man with recent trauma and seizures, now with waxing and waning changes in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was performed during obtundation. No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 which is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is slight decrease in amount of frontocentral beta over the left hemisphere.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and independently at F8/T4 less frequently.  There was also loss of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.
Generalized slow waves are seen at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  In addition to that, some frontal intermittent rhythmic delta is seen that is FIRDA.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left anterior temporal delta.
Independent intermittent right midtemporal delta.
Generalized slow waves.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is reveals evidence of focal structures dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region which is consistent with a known lesion seen on imaging.  In addition, there is independent focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which may be at least in part due to a metabolic etiology or medication effect.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that this EEG is different from the prior where some anterior temporal sharp waves were seen.
