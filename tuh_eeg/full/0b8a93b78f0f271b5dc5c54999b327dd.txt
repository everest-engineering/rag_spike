HISTORY: 70 year old right handed male with right temporal mass with 4 spells of confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Decadron, Lisinopril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an appropriately organized pattern on the left with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The right hemisphere demonstrates slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8 Hz with intermittent rhythmic slowing on the right, some of which is sharply contoured, and a handful of sharp waves in the right frontal central region. Brief epochs of drowsiness include stage II sleep. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. The patient is drifting into stage II sleep around the time of photic stimulation.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency and the presence of rhythmic delta which was nearly continuous.
2. Very sharply contoured waves or sharp waves in the right frontal central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is compatible with a structural abnormality on the right involving gray and white matter. The sharply contoured findings are congruent with the seizure history.
