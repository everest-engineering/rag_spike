CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with anxiety, migraine headaches, and mood swings.  The patient had a seizure in 2008, with a recurrent seizure last week with tonic clonic activity.  In addition, wakes up to find herself incontinent and aching.  Past history of syncope as a child.

MEDICATIONS:

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic background theta and prominent beta activity as well as POSTS.

Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude at the background.

Heart rate 90 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta is an anticipated finding with the use of benzodiazepines.  No epileptiform features were identified.
