CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed woman with new onset seizures characterized by a blank stare then loss of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic activity. This was followed by postictal confusion. Past medical history: HIV, HTN, reflux and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS: Vicodin, Zolpidem Tartrate, HCTZ, Lisinopril, Alprazolam, Wellbutrin, Prilosec
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm. There is generous beta. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with an increase in beta. The patient is transitioning into sleep during photic stimulation, but a driving response is elicited.
HR: 120bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Generous beta may be due to medications or anxiety.
There were no focal nor epileptiform features noted and this may have been the only dictation today that included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
