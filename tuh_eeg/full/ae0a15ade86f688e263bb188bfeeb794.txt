CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed male admitted on 6/15/2010 with a lumbar spine fracture after he had a significant fall. Past history of epilepsy, bipolar disease, manic depression disease, hepatitis-C and alcohol abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Klonopin, Cymbalta, Dilaudid, Oxycontin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appears to be quite drowsy. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixture of rhythmic activity including 1.4 Hz delta, 4 Hz activity and some 6 Hz theta. As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta. Arousals produce more of a theta pattern. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal pattern with more of a rhythmic theta and beta.
HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing .
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The features described above are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. No epileptiform features observed today.
