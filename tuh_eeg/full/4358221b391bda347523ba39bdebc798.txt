History:	47 YR MALE WITH 3 CODES 1/6 X2, 1/7.   4:10 PM 1/7 X 2MIN.1 ST 7:28 PM 1/6 APPROX 6 MIN 2 ND X 13  MIN. PT ON CONT DIALYSIS, STILL REMAINS UNRESP. YESTERDAY PT WITH EPISODES OF ?? SZS. ??CONVULSIONS.  MYOCLONIC VS SZ. COOL LAST PM HIGH TEMP NOW NORMAL
Medications:	KEPPRA.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 102  Technical difficulties: There a continuous diffuse muscle artifact and dialysis machine artifact that impedes the full evaluation of the electrical activity.
Summary of Findings:
No activation procedures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
