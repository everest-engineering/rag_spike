CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male status post aneurysm clip with right frontocentral craniotomy and postoperative seizures.  Seizure-free since July of 2011, but now with headaches, skull defect.  The patient's history is unclear, the patient now no longer has headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Dilantin, Claritin, Prilosec, Motrin, Theragran
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta with subtle, frontocentral theta 4 Hz in the right frontocentral region.  Vertex waves were observed in Stage I sleep.  Occasional FIRDA was noted as the patient transitioned in and out of sleep. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing in the right frontocentral temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed. The breach rhythm and the focal slowing are in the region of this patient's craniotomy.
