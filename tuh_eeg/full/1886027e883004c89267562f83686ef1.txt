LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 35-year-old man with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness with associated tongue biting and difficult arousal.  First such event occurred in March of 2012.  Last such event occurred in December of 2012.  Patient had a total of about 5-6 of these episodes.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 8 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, bursts of theta and delta diffusely are observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no change in the background.

FINDINGS:
1. Slow posterior dominant rhythm.
2. No stage II sleep.
3. No epileptiform discharges.

IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 27 minute EEG due to slow posterior dominant rhythm.  This findings indicates etiologically nonspecific mild cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II
sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
