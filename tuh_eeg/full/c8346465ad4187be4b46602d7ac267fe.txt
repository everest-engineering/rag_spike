CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed male status post stroke with
development of seizures October 15, 2009. History of diabetes and hypertension. This
is an outpatient EEG.

MEDICATIONS: None recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 7 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. The overall background demonstrates rhythmic slowing. As the patient drifts
into drowsiness there is a single T4-T2 sharp wave. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving period.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In that there was only 1 sharp wave, this cannot be
considered definitively epileptiform.
