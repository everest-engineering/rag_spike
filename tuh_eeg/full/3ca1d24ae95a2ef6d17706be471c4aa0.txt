History:	47 year old woman with recurrent seizures.  Patient has right frontal skull defect (
begins at f3, fz, f4, t2 )///
Medications:	Topamax, Depakene, Celexa, Prozac, Xanax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient is weak,
more so over the right.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present over the bifrontal regions, more so over
the right.  There is rhythmic moderate-to-high amplitude monomorphic sharply contoured theta
activity noted over the right.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is attempted but patient is not able to cooperate.  Stepped photic stimulation is
not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral (R>L) anterior
Focal slowing, rhythmic, continuous, right anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Disorganization, mild
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 20 minute EEG due to mild-moderate bifrontal focal slowing
that is especially prominent over the right. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific, but likely structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
