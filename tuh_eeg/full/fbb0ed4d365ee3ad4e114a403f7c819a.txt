DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9  Hz alpha rhythm.  In drowsiness, there is an increase in background slowing with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting into stage 2 sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  78  bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
