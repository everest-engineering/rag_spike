History:	28 YR FEMALE ADM TO ED OD,  HEROIN, XANAX, PERCOCET, COCAINE.
GIVEN NARCAN X2 IN ER. WITH HALDOL. PT NOW WITH CC OF SLURRED
SPEECH AND WEAKNESS. / 4/4/ FOLLOW UP EEG FOR ? TOXIC METABOLIC
Medications:	HEPARIN, VIMPAT, DILANTIN, METHADONE.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
During limited wakefulness with eyes closed for 5 seconds a PDR cannot be seen.  However during
10 seconds of wakefulness a symmetric central 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Wakefulness was only achieved with stimulation.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Please
note that some spindles at times become very prominent in the frontal regions.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 22
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG with very limited wakefulness and a very short sleep latency. The short
sleep latency may represent a sleep disorder and/or alternatively may represent medication effect.
No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
