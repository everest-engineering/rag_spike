History:	32 year old woman with a history of seizures that occurred last year.  They were
reportedly related to abrupt Xanax discontinuation.
Medications:	PERCOCET
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized diffuse low amplitude fast activity that decreases in amplitude
with eye opening (fast alpha variant).  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 28-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could
be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  This is a 2nd
normal EEG for this patient.
