CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old with renal failure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, multiple strokes and heart failure.  Admitted with generalized shaking of her head and extremities, as well as confusion for 1 minute, followed by post ictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, nitroglycerin, midazolam, morphine, Keppra, heparin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency and dynamic pattern.  Some sections of the record are richer in theta, others in beta.  Prominent shifting slowing was noted.  Occasional bursts of higher amplitude slow frontal delta which may be rhythmic or arrhythmia was noted.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
Heart rate 104 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Prominent generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a clearly arousable and interactive patient.  Tactile stimulation or spontaneously the patient was noted to have eye movements and an increase in faster frequency activity.  Overall, the findings described above may represent a metabolic pattern, although this does not exclude a new CNS insult.  There were no specific epileptiform features.
