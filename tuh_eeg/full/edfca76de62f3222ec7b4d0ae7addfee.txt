CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old male with a neuroleptic malignant syndrome
attributed to Seroquel and Zoloft, persistent obtundation, and occasional right-sided
twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is relatively sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is relatively slow. There is
more of a pattern of diffuse delta and theta. There is a right occipital periodic sharp
wave noted in the background. There also seems to be a positivity in the right
centrotemporal region. The periodic sharp wave is relatively simple in morphology and
does not wax and wane. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster
frequency activity. The patient drifts off to sleep during the EEG with beta spindles.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A simple right occipital periodic complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may represent a postictal or late ictal
pattern_ No clinical seizures were recorded. Of note, the overall background is slower
than previously than some of the initial sections of his more recent EEGs.
