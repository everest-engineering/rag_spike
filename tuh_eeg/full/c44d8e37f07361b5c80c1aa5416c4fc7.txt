CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old with right upper quadrant pain and change in mental status, multi-infarct state followed by respiratory distress and intracranial hemorrhage.

MEDICATIONS: Folate Acid, Keppra, Gentamicin, Labetalol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a dynamic background. Some sections of the record are more of a rhythmic theta frequency pattern and others include more arrhythmic delta activity. There is intermittent asymmetry with at some point a bit more focal delta in the left hemisphere. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal.

HR: 96 bpm and irregular.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Modest generalized background slowing.
2. A dynamic pattern with a mixture of theta or delta.
3. Occasional focal slowing a bit more prominent on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific but support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. The dynamic pattern with the appearance of theta is a positive prognostic feature.
