CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old woman with previous left meningioma removed from the temporal regions, follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of muscle.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS in stage 2 sleep.  As the patient transitions to sleep, a breach rhythm was identified with beta accentuation in the left central region, but muscle activity persists into sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm noted in sleep is a normal finding.  No epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
