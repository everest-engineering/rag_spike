STUDY DURATION:  6 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure classification.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman with history of MS, seizures, GERD, anemia, kidney stones, described as episodes of eyes rolling up, spit coming out of the mouth, and tonic clonic shaking for about 20 minutes, also leg spasms.  She is here for seizure classification.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, baclofen, levothyroxine, nitrofurantoin, Percocet, Oxycontin, Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded mainly in wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement and A2 electrode artifact seen during this recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.
Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness mainly during the 6 hours.
Abnormal discharges:  Frequent focal slowing seen at T3, at times at F7/T3 at a frequency at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal and anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid to anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
