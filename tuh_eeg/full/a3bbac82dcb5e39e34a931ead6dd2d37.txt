History:	30 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS ON 2/2/14 WITH H/O FOUND HANGING WITH
CORD AROUND NECK DOWNTIME APPROX 10 MIN. ASYSTOLIC IN FIELD,
INTUBATED, EPI X 2 WITH RETURN OF PULSE./// HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL,
BODY TEMP NOE @ 31.4 /RE-WARMING TO START @ 6PM.// PMHX SIG FOR
Medications:	VERSED, NOREPINEPHRINE,MIDAZOLAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by intermittent
irregular high amplitude delta sharply contoured frontal predominant activity seen symmetrically
over the two hemispheres.  In between the bursts there is diffuse attenuation of electrical activity
with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No stimulation was performed.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate to severe diffuse background slowing,
intermittent attenuation and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
