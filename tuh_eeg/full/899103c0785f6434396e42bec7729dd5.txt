CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 10, history of childhood lead poisoning and right-sided cavernoma and Bell palsy.  Patient had a recent episode which may have been a seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Norvasc, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable routine outpatient EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is intermittent, focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere, particularly right mid to posterior temporal region or parieto-occipital region.  The patient appears to be relatively drowsy.
Hyperventilation produces slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to focal slowing noted in the right mid to posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to the previous EEG, 09/12/2013, no sharp waves were noted today.  The focal slowing is similar to the previous study.  There are also mild age-related changes noted in drowsiness in this record.
