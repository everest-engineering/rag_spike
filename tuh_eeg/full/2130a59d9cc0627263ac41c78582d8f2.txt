History:	60 YR FEMALE S/P GBM, CHEMO RX CRANI.    RETURNS TO TUH WITH 2 SZS.  PT HAS RECENTLY BEEN MORE SOMNOLENT  1-2 WKS
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
DEPACON
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient. Background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular 4-7Hz activity. States changes are noted, but not typical sleep architecture.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant. Continuous periodic and semi-periodic sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves (PLEDs and quasi-PLEDs) are noted over the right posterior quadrant with a repetition rate of 0.5-1 Hz. Maximal scalp negativity occurs over T6/P4 lead.
No electrographic seizures are captured. HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges}, continuous, right posterior quadrant Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right posterior quadrant
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG due to continuous moderate right posterior quadrant focal slowing and right posterior quadrant periodic and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. These findings are indicative of a focal structural, potentially epileptogenic, lesion in the right posterior quadrant, consistent with the known lesion No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
