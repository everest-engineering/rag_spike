DATE OF STUDY:  This is EEG monitoring January 6 through January 9.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 29-year-old with severe head trauma, status post decompressive craniectomy on the left, now in pentobarbital coma.

INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  January 6 through January 7:  This EEG is markedly suppressed with a low burst rate, sometimes as infrequent as 1 per minute or 2 to 3 per minute.
No seizures are noted.
There is occasional artifact observed including approximately 0.75 Hz to 1.5 Hz movement artifact.
January 7 through January 8:  By 6:00 p.m., the EEG is less suppressed, and by 10:00 p.m., although the electrodes are a little bit more fragile, the EEG is quite suppressed but there is a burst suppression pattern with periods of suppression that are only about 5 seconds in duration.  Bursts of activity remain quite brief.
January 8 through January 9:  This section of the record demonstrates a lower voltage, not entirely suppressed pattern.  There are slower bursts of mixed theta-delta, rather than more prominent paroxysmal activity.  As the recording continues, the EEG is increasingly continuous, sharply contoured.
Electrode integrity is sometimes fragile.
Most of the EEG demonstrates more sharply contoured mixed faster activity and theta activity with some left frontal sharp waves but no seizures.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
