LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with past medical history of stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, dementia, hypertension, seizures who now presents for potential withdrawal of her seizure medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra, Norvasc, nortriptyline, metoprolol and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and symmetrical vertex waves are observed.  Additionally during drowsiness, occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the bitemporal regions.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  A normal awake and drowsy 23 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for procedure persists, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be a benefit. The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
