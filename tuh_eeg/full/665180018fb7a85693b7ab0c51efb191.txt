History:	79 YR MALE WITH SOB/CHF EXAC. WITH EPISODE OF DROWSINESS AND NOT RESPONDING TO ANY STIM X10 MIN . PMHX: CHF, SOB, AFIB, HLD, HTN, CAD, ANEMIA, SX
Medications:	dilantin, lipitor, coreg
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity during wakefulness with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  During sleep, the background is characterized by delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate, bilateral diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. As well as  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
