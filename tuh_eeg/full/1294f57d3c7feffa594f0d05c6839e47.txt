History:	73 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O MAINLY RIGHT HAND/ARM SHAKING
LASTING 5-10 SECONDS, HAS OCCURRED IN LEFT. ONSET 3-4 MOS. AGO PT
DENIES LOC/ UNRESPONSIVENESS DURING EPISODE. PMHX SIG  CVA 2001
AND HLD
Medications:	Neurontin, Keppra.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is 7Hz excess theta activity during wakefulness.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region, seen maximally at T3,
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 72 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
