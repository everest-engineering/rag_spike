History:	77 year old woman admitted with change in mental status.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal PDR reaches 9 Hz.  AP gradient is normal.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75
uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-
200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency
during drowsiness.  Patient rapidly transitions between wakefulness and stage II sleep.  Sleep
consists of symmetrical vertex waves, POSTS, sleep spindles and K-complexes.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
FIRDA could be seen in encephalopathy, bilateral deep white matter disease, increased ICP.
Patient rapidly transitions between wakefulness and stage II sleep.  This signifies excessively drowsy
patient.  Please correlate clinically.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
