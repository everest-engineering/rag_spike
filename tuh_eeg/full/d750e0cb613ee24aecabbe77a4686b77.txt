CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old with post gunshot wound to the head, left temporal craniotomy, seizure free for the last 7 months, but Intermittent auras, lightheadedness and headaches.

MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Neurontin, Amitriptyline.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement in lab using 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry. The activity on the right is lower voltage on the left. It Is higher amplitude. There seems to be a skull defect and there is some sharply contoured slowing as well as beta accentuation. In this region, there also seems to be some sharply contoured theta. Hyperventilation accentuates these asymmetries. Following hyperventilation, the patient drifts into stage II sleep. There Is more spindle on the left compared to the right, but there is more frontal arrhythmic delta activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving more so on the left.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Asymmetry.
4. Unique features in each hemisphere with slower more low voltage act. on the right, but with more sharply contoured slowing on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:. These findings may be correlated. imaging and previous studies in regard to this individuals epilepsy.
