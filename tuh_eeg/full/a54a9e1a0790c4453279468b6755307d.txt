History:	76 year old female with worsening mental status including forgetfulness and loss of
Medications:	No anti-seizure medications
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-30uV, 8-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During periods of maximal arousal, there is mild, intermittent bitemporal
slowing (6-7Hz theta) seen.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
did not induce a significant photic driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent mid-temporal slowing. No
epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Bitemporal slowing may
suggest a toxic-metabolic or structural effect but may also represent excessive drowsiness.  Clinical
context is recommended.
