CLINICAL HISTORY:  New onset seizures with right-sided focal shaking followed by right eye deviation.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is diffusely slow.  From the left hemisphere, there is a periodic sharp complex which is polyphasic in nature.
Although due to technical limitations only a limited review is seen, there is no definitive evolution.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing, which is bihemispheric in nature.
A complex periodic complex in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern with significant epileptogenic potential.  Additional EEG recording is essential to evaluate for additional clinical or subclinical seizures.
