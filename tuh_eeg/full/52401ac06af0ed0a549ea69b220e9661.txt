CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 20-year-old male, status post MVA.  His face had staples, although no scar visible at present.  Femur fracture.  At the time of the accident, patient was described as having either a seizure or panic attack.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This was a technically acceptable 24-minute EEG with impedances below 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes.  This is an awake and drowsy record in a relatively drowsy adult.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness was characterized by rhythmic background slowing as well as some rhythmic frontal slowing followed by POSTS.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep, but a driving response was achieved with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.
Hyperventilation was performed with limited effort and produced primarily a drowsy pattern.
Heart rate 66-80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be a value.
