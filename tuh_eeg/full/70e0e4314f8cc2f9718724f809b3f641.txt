CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old woman, status post acoustic neuroma resection, now with persistent daily facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lexapro, temazepam, Lipitor, and others.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This was primarily a sleep EEG or at least a drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz, 20 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with generous low voltage, frontal/ central beta. Muscle artifact is noted in wakefulness. Drowsiness includes abundant beta activity as well as rhythmic theta and rare of spindles in sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep, but did produce a driving response, hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
