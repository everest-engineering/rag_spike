REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  She is an 77-year-old woman with diabetes where for follow up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Levetiracetam and lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal posterior and single lead of EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included  photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 60.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F10/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
