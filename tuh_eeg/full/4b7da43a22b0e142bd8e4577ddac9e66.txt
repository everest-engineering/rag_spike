History:	20 year old woman with history of seizures presented with convulsion.
Medications:	Keppra, Vimpat
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate
amplitude theta>delta activity.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured  The patient remains awake
throughout the study.
Intermittent high amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are captured over the left
mid-temporal - central region (T3/C3 maximally).  Approximately 8 second run of these discharges at
a repletion rate of 0.75-1 Hz is captured.  There is no temporal or spacial evolution and there is no
clear clinical correlate (albeit the patient is not formally tested).
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Sharp waves, intermittent, left, midtemporal-central
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute awake-only portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
intermittent left midtemporal-central epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing  is indicative of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There is a potentially
epileptogenic focus in the left midtemporal- central region.  No electrographic seizures are present.
