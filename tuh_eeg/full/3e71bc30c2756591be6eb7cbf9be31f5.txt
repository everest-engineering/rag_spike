History:	69 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  MYOCLONUS JERKING ONSET
MAY/SEPT 2014, EXPRESSIVE SPEECH DIFF; SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS
AND PROLONG PERIODS OF SLEEP.
Medications:	Aldactone, Lioresal, Theragran, Ibuprofen
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present at best reaching 6Hz.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Intermittent brief bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal polymorphic 1 to 2 Hz, 80-100 uV
slow waves are observed during wakefulness.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm with
FIRDA.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
