CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old female with change in mental status, status post fall and CT scan showing old right thalamic bleed with bilateral calcification and vasogenic edema. Also has bilateral parietal and left occipital vasogenic edema. The past medical history is significant for hypertension, COPD, blood clots in the lungs and the legs.
MEDICATIONS: Versed, ASA, Lisinopril, Advair, Carvedilol, Simvastatin, Lasix,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. This is an asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background of the EEG is slow and disorganized. There is a lot of beta activity seen. There is occasionally posterior delta. There is arrhythmia delta with slowing on the right than on the left. There are also bursts of FIRDA seen in the EEG.
HR: 75 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background
2. There is arrhythmic delta with focal slowing on the right.
3. FIRDA
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal spikes seen. Focal features are congruent with a neurosurgical history. FIRDA is nonspecific which could be seen in toxic/metabolic encephalopathy or frontal lobe process. The arrhythmic delta on the right is consistent with her right basal ganglion hemorrhage.
