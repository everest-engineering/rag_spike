CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old male with new onset seizures. Tonic-clonic activity versus panic attack in a motor vehicle accident.

MEDICATIONS: None.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of. EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and a small increase in theta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
