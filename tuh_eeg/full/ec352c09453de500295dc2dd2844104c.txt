CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right handed female with migraines, insomnia and seizures about once a week.
MEDICATIONS:  Prilosec, Restoril
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and II sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an ill defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta seen throughout the recording.  It seems that she has increased beta activity due to head rocking artifact. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Excessive beta activities were most likely due to head rocking artifact. Note:  A normal EEG does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy.
