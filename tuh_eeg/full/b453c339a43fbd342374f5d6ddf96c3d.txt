CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with history of seizures, mental retardation, schizophrenia, here for follow-up EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Risperdal, Norvasc.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-defined, 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.  Rhythmic central theta is noted as the patient becomes drowsier. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG differs from a previous study in that there is no excess theta.  The background theta described
previously may have been related to this patient's medications or other causes.  This is second EEG without epileptiform activity.
