History:	47 year old woman with a history of seizures, admitted from an outside hospital with
change in mental status.
Medications:	phenobarbital,dilantin,amoxicillin,onfi
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture theta and alpha
activity with overriding evolving rhythmic patterns (seizures).  There are continuous rhythmic high
amplitude 2-2.5 Hz bifrontal, right>left, spikes with accompanied polyspikes that frequently increase
in amplitude and speed throughout the parasagittal regions posteriorly.  Clinically, patient is
confused but is able to answer simple questions and follow simple commands.  No normal sleep
architecture is present but periods of quiescence are observed.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, bilateral (R>L) anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 25-minute EEG due to focal status epilepticus involving bilateral anterior
regions, right>left. This finding is indicative of an epileptogenic focus in the anterior cerebral
regions, right>left.  Mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing is etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild-to-
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.  Patient
will be placed on long-term EEG monitoring.
