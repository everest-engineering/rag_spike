CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed gentleman with cerebral palsy, left hemiparesis, epilepsy. The patient is currently having simple complex partial seizures characterized by a vibration feeling up the body and into the left arm. There may be shaking that others can visualize particularly his sister, but sometimes, others do not see the seizures. Sarcoid.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Coumadin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 hertz alpha rhythm. There is an intermittent asymmetry noted with destruction of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate this focality particularly in the right frontocentral region.
Drowsiness also seems to accentuate the focal features. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Right frontotemporal sharp waves maximum F8 and FP2 are observed as the patient drifts off into sleep. With the use of an average reference, this activity is maximum at F8. It is so exquisitely high amplitude that it is almost negative at the midline.
The amplitude of the discharge in F8 and T2 are 80 to 103 microvolts, but it is higher amplitude particularly at F8 rather than T2.
HR: 68 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right frontotemporal sharp waves and spikes.
2. Right frontocentral and frontotemporal focal slowing accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with the focal mechanism for the patient's epilepsy as well as clinical scenario.
