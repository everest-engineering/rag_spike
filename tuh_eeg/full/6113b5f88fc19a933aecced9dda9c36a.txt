CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old with aortic disease and triple vessel disease for aortic aneurysm repair.  It is an outpatient EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, glucosamine, chondroitin.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed but hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the backgrounds EEG is appropriately organized with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm and central mu activity.  This patient is very sleepy, dropping in and out of stage 1 sleep with vertex waves.  Nine Hz mu was identified but testing was not performed to confirm this.
The patient was falling sleep, drifting in and out from wakefulness to early stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation but there was no significant driving response.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG will be used as a baseline for this patient's aortic repair.
