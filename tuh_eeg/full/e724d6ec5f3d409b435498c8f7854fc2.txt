History:	58 YO MALE WITH HX OF HTN AND DM. PRESENTS AFTER BEING FOUND
MOANING AND UNRESPONSIVE FOR 25 MIN. PT HAD DRUG PARAPHERNALIA
AROUND HIM. + COCAINE. CTH: LEFT PARIETAL HYPODENSITY WITH SIGNS
OF VOLUME LOSS.
Medications:	INSULIN, PHENYTOIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
