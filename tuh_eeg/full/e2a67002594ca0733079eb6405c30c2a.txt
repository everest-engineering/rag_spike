CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old male with tonic clonic seizures, multiple medical problems including right temporal hemorrhage 2 years ago, HIV, and ESRD.  Currently, seizure-free.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Technical challenges included muscle artifact on the left.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage.  There is a mild asymmetry with a bit more slowing on the right compared to the left.  The left includes primarily rhythmic theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the right hemisphere focal slowing is accentuated particularly in the centrotemporal region and broadly contoured right centrotemporal sharp waves emerge.  Drowsiness is not sustained and the patient transitions in and out of a drowsy state.

Photic stimulation was remarkable for a driving response at faster flash frequencies which was asymmetric, more remarkable on the left.

Heart rate:  50 to 60 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due.
1. Right focal slowing.
2. Broadly contoured right temporal sharp waves noted in drowsiness.
3. Mild background slowing on the left.
4. Asymmetric driving response

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, but one that involves the right hemisphere more significantly than the left.  The sharp waves are in the region of the patient's previous hemorrhage. EEG is improved compared to 2012
