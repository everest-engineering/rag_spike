AGE: 58 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/24/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1723
HISTORY:
58 y.o. female with a history of benzodiazepine abuse and 2 episodes of LOC, one possibly associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal and the other an episode of waxing and waning shaking over hours, referred for routine EEG for evaluation for possible epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth 2 times daily as needed for Anxiety .
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
trifluoperazine (STELAZINE) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy one-hour EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy one-hour EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
