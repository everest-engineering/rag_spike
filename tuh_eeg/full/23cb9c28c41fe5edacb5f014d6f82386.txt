CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old right handed gentleman with intermittent paroxysmal
vertigo.
MEDICATIONS: Combigan, Glipizide, Simvastatin, Metformin, Meclizine, quinapril,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed.in lab using standard 20-20
system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 30 Hz 30 microvolt alpha
rhythm with a slow amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is
performed early on in the record producing a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in background beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If this patient's paroxysmal vertigo is
thought to be a seizure, consideration for outpatient EEG monitoring is appropriate to
more completely capture his spells.
