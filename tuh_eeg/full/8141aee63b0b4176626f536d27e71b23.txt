INTRODUCTION:
A routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes as well as anterior temporal electrodes. Awake and stage I sleep were recorded. No activation procedures were performed.
MEDICATIONS:
Protonix, heparin, aspirin, Zocor, Depakote, and hydralazine.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None.

HISTORY:
A 28-year-old male with a recent stroke presents with complaints change in behavior with difficulty with speech and comprehension, status post left MCA/ACA infarct after stopping using cocaine a month ago.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to well-performed posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening and closing with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts. Which is slightly asymmetric, is better seen on the right hemisphere. There is some asymmetric frontal central activity, which is better seen also on the right hemisphere. Stage I is seen and no activation procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves: Seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal at C3/T3. At times, this activity increases in frequency over the left central region but there is no clear evolution.
2. Focal sharp waves: Occasional C3 sharp waves were seen.

SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to left hemispheric slowing maximal in the left central region with occasional sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG is consistent with focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the left hemisphere maximal in the central region, which may be due to the recent stroke. No seizures were seen.
