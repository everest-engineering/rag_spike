CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is 43 years old.  History of childhood epilepsy with epilepsy in infancy, treated with Dilantin and phenobarbital.  The patient outgrew her epilepsy, but recently has been evaluated for blackout spells, treated with Keppra.  Presents now with prolonged QT syndrome, hypokalemia and abdominal pain with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  There were minor technical difficulties with this record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Frequent eye blink was noted.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic alpha.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response at intermediate flash frequencies.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
