History:	40 yo male hx of GSW to the right temporal region in 1999. He subsequently began
to have seizures.  He became seizure free in 2005 until 2014. His last seizure
occurred ~ 1 week ago.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Several synchronous bifrontal low amplitude sharp waves are noted, R>L.  Maximal scalp
negativity occurs over Fp2>Fp1 leads.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, bilateral (R>L) frontal, synchronous, low amplitude
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute awake and asleep EEG due to several bifrontal synchronous,
right>left, epileptiform discharges. This finding is indicative of potentially epileptogenic area in the
bifrontal regions, right>left.
