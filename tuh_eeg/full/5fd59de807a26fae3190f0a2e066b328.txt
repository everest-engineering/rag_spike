History:	21 year old male with childhood TBI and multiple seizure types.  Patient reports
recent increase in frequency of black out spells.
Medications:	Vimpat, Onfi
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The background over the right, consists of 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity with preserved
AP gradient.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of unstable and very fragmented 7-
7.5 Hz theta activity with no clear AP gradient, underriding monomorphic delta activity, excess beta
over the anterior quadrant and intermittent left occipital  sharp waves, with maximal scalp
negativity over the O1 electrode.  Patient appears awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left hemisphere.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous hemispheric, mild-to-moderate
Sharp waves, intermittent, left occipital, maximal over O1
Breach artifact, left anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to continuous mild-to-moderate left
hemispheric slowing and intermittent left occipital epileptiform discharges. These findings indicate
left hemispheric focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and a potential
epileptogenic focus in the left occipital region.  Breach artifact is due to the skull defect.
