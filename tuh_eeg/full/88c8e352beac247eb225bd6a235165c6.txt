CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old male with Crouzon Syndrome with a history of
hydrocephalus and PRESS.
MEDICATIONS: Amlodipine, Metoprolol, ASA, Benicar, Ranitidine, Tricor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite drowsy throughout the entire
EEG. The overall pattern is a relatively low-voltage record. In maximal wakefulness,
there is excess theta and then the patient drifts off into sleep. Vertex waves are noted
in stage 1 sleep. There are some bursts of some shifting asymmetry in the frontocentral
regions noted in sleep. There is also a beta accentuation at F3/C3. Photic stimulation
serves to produce an alerting response with an increase in alpha and theta frequency
activity. There also seems to be a more definitive left frontocentral focus noted in photic
stimulation but no definitive driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess background slowing.
2. Sharply contoured activity what seems to be a beta accentuation and a subtle left
frontal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function as well as a focal mechanism for seizures. This record is markedly improved
from a previous study a year ago.
