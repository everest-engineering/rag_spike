CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old male with childhood epilepsy.  Last seizure at age 11.  Now, experiencing intermittent, random lightheadedness, particularly when he stands for a long period of time.  He may have symptoms as if his frontalis muscles are tightening up.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 9.7, 40 microvolts which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.  Hyperventilation was characterized by an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response bilaterally.  Supraharmonic driving and harmonic driving were noted.
Heart rate 100 bpm, although the patient was resting in a chair.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  In this individual with childhood epilepsy, there are no epileptiform features.  Additional evaluation regarding the somewhat rapid resting heart rate for a young adult may be of value.
