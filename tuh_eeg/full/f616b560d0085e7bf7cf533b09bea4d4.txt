MEDICATIONS:  None.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old woman, now 10 weeks pregnant.  Past history of seizures in previous pregnancies including a seizure in 2007 while pregnant.  She had her 1st EEG performed at age 19 at 38 weeks gestation following a convulsion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was performed.  This is a routine 20 minute EEG with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and hyper synchronous rhythmic theta.  Brief deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, but the patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG for this young adult.  At age 19, she had an occipital response to hyperventilation, which is a relatively normal finding in a young person.  At that time there was a question of underlying spike and wave activity.  None was identified today.  The patient does demonstrate a normal variant, which is rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness, but this is overall a normal EEG.
Additional clinical evaluation may be considered if this patient is thought to have ongoing risk for seizures.
