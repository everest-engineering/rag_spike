CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes, TTS, liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, grossly icteric with a tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Lactulose and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is markedly abnormal with a slower, featureless theta pattern and then 8 Hz alpha frequency activity identified in the central regions.  The 8 Hz central theta is rhythmic, does not evolve.
The patient transitions into features of normal stage II sleep with vertex waves and 13 Hz sleep spindles.
As the recording continues, the patient is stimulated and an awake pattern with theta is noted.  In wakefulness, the patient is confused, but a low voltage theta pattern was observed.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal and unusual EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Unusual 8 Hz central rhythmic activity in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates normal morphologies of stage II sleep, and in fact at the end of the record when the patient is awake and confused, there is a well defined alpha rhythm.  The unusual central activity in sleep may be part of this patient's metabolic component.  No definitive epileptiform features were noted and no clinical seizures were recorded.
