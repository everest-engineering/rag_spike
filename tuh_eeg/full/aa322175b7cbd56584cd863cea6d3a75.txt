History:	66 YO FEMALE FOUND UNRESPONSIVE AT HER SHELTER. WITNESS TOLD
EMS SHE HAD BEEN EATING FENTANYL PATCHES. GIVEN NARCAN AT SCENE.
PMHX: COPD, SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, ASTHMA
Medications:	LORAZEPAM 2MG X3, ATIVAN 2MG BEFORE
Sedation:	Lorazepam
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
Background is characterized by a variable burst-suppression pattern with bursts of delta and theta
lasting 1-3 seconds alternating with periods of diffuse attenuation lasting 1-2 seconds.  Some of the
bursts show shifting asymmetry and some consist of sharply contoured theta activity.  Stimulation of
the patient produces an increase in muscle artifact and a suppressed pattern with slow 0.3Hz
periodic discharges.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 114-126.  Technically limited 22
minute record due to electrode artifact and occasional muscle artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, persistent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG in a comatose patient because of a discontinuous burst-suppression
pattern. This is etiologically nonspecific, and may be seen after severe anoxic brain injury or acute
intoxication with drugs depressing the central nervous system.  If further monitoring is desired,
continuous or repeat EEG would be appropriate.
