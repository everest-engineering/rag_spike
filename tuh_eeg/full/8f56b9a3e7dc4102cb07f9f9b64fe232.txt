CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old woman with epilepsy, seizure-free since 2007.

MEDICATIONS: Geodon, Carbamazepine, Gabapentin, Aricept, Topamax, Ambien.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 11>-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a
modest amount of 7 Hz beta in the background and generous theta. Hyperventilation
seems to accentuate both the beta and the theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
2. Mild background disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study is similar to a previous EEG of 8/4/2008. No
epileptiform features are noted. This patient's medications are underlying CNS
pathology may produce the background disorganization and excess theta described
above.
