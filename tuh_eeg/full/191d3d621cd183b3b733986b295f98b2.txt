CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult onset posttraumatic epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.

INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Rhythmic frontal eye movements are noted, but there is also a small amount of shifting, slowing in the frontal regions.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  In addition, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is more subtle focal slowing noted in the right frontal region with drop out a faster frequency activity.  Subtle sharp waves are noted maximum anterior temporal region

Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drowsy and did produce a driving response.  It did not seem to accentuate the epileptiform activity.  Following this, the patient becomes intermittently drowsy in the left frontal sharp waves and rhythmic slowing are noted intermittently.

Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in frontal slowing.

Heart rate 90 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
1. Subtle right frontal or frontotemporal sharp waves.
2. Associated focal slowing in the same region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has had previous inpatient and outpatient EEG monitoring with similar findings, although in some cases the epileptiform activities going to be of more posterotemporal.  No seizures were recorded today.
