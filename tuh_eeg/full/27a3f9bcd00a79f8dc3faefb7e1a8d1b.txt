LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  1 hour and 2 minutes.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 34-year-old woman who presents with 5 episodes of loss of consciousness.  This started on 03/30/2013 with the last episode occurring on 06/09/2013.  The episode lasted up to 2 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include gabapentin, zonisamide, Protonix, and vitamin D.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low amplitude, 11-11.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS, (posterior occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and there is also no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation resulted symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a regular heart rate.  Three isolated sharp transients are captured over the left temporal regions.  These discharges are likely fragments of normal sleep architecture.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a perfectly normal awake and asleep over 1 hour EEG.  Three isolated sharp transients observed over the left temporal region, likely representing fragments of normal sleep architecture.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
