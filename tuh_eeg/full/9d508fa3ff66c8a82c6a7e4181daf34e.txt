CLINICAL HISTORY:    20 year old right handed male with past medical history of seizures with increased seizure frequency, last one lasting 10 minutes with incontinence.  Prior to this, he had only had a seizure 1 month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Topamax.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior electrodes as well as EKG electrodes.  EEG was recorded in wakefulness as well as in sleep.  No activated procedures were performed..
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens up to mildly slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm which at times reaches 9 Hz but mainly in the 7-8 Hz range which is reactive to eye opening. There are some frontal signs of beta seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and stage 2.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen in wakefulness.
There is a midline theta pattern seen in drowsiness which is likely benign and resembles ciganek rhythm.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive data in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology. No seizure nor epileptiform discharges were seen.
