History:	PT HAS CONT MOUTH MOVEMENT ARTIFACT( HAND IN MOUTH ).   PRIOR EEG
CC CHANGE IN MS (NO CHART).  LENNOX GASTAUT. PT PRESENTS WITH
MULTI SEIZURES GIVEN ATIVAN
Medications:	ONFI, DEPAKOTE, TEGRETOL, ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at F3 and independently at F4 ( left more than right)  This discharges at times have a
large field that rapidly spreads to the frontotemporal and prefrontal area, particularly on the left.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90  Technical difficulties: The
patient had continuous eye movement and head movement during the entire test.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral (L>R) frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the bifrontal region.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition  to
moderate  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
