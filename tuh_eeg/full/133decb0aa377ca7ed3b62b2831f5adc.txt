REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old man, with a history of a seizure a month ago.  Now with recurrent seizure and facial trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lovenox, lidocaine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness only.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy, and a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in elucidating the diagnosis.
