History:	47 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NOTED WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL

TEMP/ CENT AREA. EEG TO R/O SZ, PT DENIES EVER HAVING SZ
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. There is an associated increased voltage and faster frequencies in the
region consistent with a breach rhythm.  At time sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left central, with an associated breach
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
left central region, which is consistent with the known surgery.
