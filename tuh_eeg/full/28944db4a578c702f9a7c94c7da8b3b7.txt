CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed woman with epilepsy and refractory
headaches. Her last seizure was 6 years ago.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Gabapentin, Lamotrigine, Sertraline, Hydroco/APAP
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Some sections of the records are well organized with rhythmic 8 Hz alpha rhythm, others demonstrate a little bit more disorganization with rhythmic slowing, particularly in the posterior regions. This is accentuated by hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, again with slight accentuation of the theta seen in the posterior regions, somewhat left more so than the right. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response, although the patient is drifting off to sleep. Vertex waves are noted at the close of photic stimulation.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Posteriorly predominant slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were observed, although the posteriorly predominant slowing was sometimes more remarkable on the left than the right. These findings may be correlated with imaging.
