CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old male with history of alcohol abuse, found down, somnolent, 5 minute episode of shaking in the emergency room.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, antibiotics, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard,   10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is quite somnolent but somewhat responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern, low in voltage with mixed theta and delta as well as smaller amounts of beta.  The record demonstrates subtle, intermittent attenuations of less than 1 second in duration.
There is reactivity and variability with some sections of the record demonstrating more theta than others.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a generalized slow pattern.
Intermittent attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  Overall, this EEG is most supportive of a bihemispheric, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as might be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or postictal state.
