Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions independently
during wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of independent rare focal slowing in
the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
