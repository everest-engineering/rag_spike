CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed male with epilepsy and migraine,
currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Propranolol, Relpax.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake an asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with 10 Hz symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts with a small
amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
attenuation of the alpha rhythmic central theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving. Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
