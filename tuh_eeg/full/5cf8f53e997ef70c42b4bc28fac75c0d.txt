CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old gentleman with a seizure 1 year ago.  The patient recalls feeling dizzy, fell down, hit head, and hurt his shoulder.  History of depression and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Sleep-deprived EEG was requested but the patient was sent for routine EEG which was performed.  EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Impedances were left slow almost with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes which were 5.6 and 5.7 respectively.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta.  First excess, K-complex spindles, and posts were identified in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation was performed while the patient was falling asleep and did not otherwise activate the record.  The patient was also falling asleep during photic stimulation without significant driving response.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal low voltage EEG in wakefulness and sleep in an otherwise hypersomnolent patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A low voltage EEG is a normal finding.  This patient's excessive drowsiness may be due to the fact that this was a sleep deprived record.
