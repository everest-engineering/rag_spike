CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old woman with mental retardation and seizures, now with some episodes of staring, blinking, and contrary behavior.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  DIGITAL:  A 20-minute digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was initiated.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  The patient had a cough and had difficulty getting comfortable during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is poorly organized with a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There are bursts of somewhat irregular, posteriorly predominant slowing with an underlying T6 sharp wave and on rare occasions, almost a central temporal sharp wave.  As the patient becomes drowsy, hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing was noted.
On occasion, when the technologist asked the patient is to follow commands, she did the contrary, so if she was asked to open her eyes, she held them tightly closed.
Photic stimulation:  Did not activate the record.
Heart rate: 120 BPM
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal routine video EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Likely underlying ill-defined epileptiform focus in the right posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bi-hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Consideration for a localization related epilepsy is appropriate in an uncomfortable individual with a cough, tachycardia may merit evaluation.
