CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed female with a history of a possible brain mass presents with a recent fall in the setting of lightheadedness.  No seizure activity.  Past medical history of HIV.
MEDICATIONS:  Levetiracetam, Heparin, Efavirenz, Trimethoprim.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy, as well as stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is best seen over the right hemisphere, reaching 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is frontocentral beta seen best over the right hemisphere and less over the left.  There is some normal sleep architecture seen at the end of the recording.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Left hemispheric slowing, maximal in the frontal region at F7/T3, seen continuously throughout the recording.  There is also seen loss of faster frequencies over this hemisphere.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left hemispheric slowing, seen maximally over the frontal region with additional loss of faster frequencies.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction involving white matter and gray matter of the left hemisphere, maximal in the frontal region, which is consistent with the known lesion.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
