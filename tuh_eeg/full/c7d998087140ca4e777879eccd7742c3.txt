EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F8/T4 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  At times it becomes monomorphic consistent with temporal intermittent delta
activity (TIRDA).  Rare sharp waves are seen at F7 with a large field that spreads over the right
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare, left frontotemporal, large bifrontal field
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, marked, left frontotemporal
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of Left fronto-temporal sharp waves
and anterior temporal intermittent rhythmic activity, both of which are potentially epileptogenic.
In addition there focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is non-
specific with regards to etiology.
