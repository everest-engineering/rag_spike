History:	52 YO MALE WITH BLACK-OUTS VS SZ X2 IN LAST 3 WEEKS. LAST SZ 4
YEARS AGO.
Medications:	ELAVIL, VIT-D, FOLVITE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse excess 7-Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 75 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Diffuse excess theta during wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
