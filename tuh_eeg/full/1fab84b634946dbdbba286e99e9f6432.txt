History:	67 year old man with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Ativan 4 mg, Keppra, neurontin, morphine.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The awake background consists of slow diffuse polymorphic delta
activity with underriding fast activity.  During periods of quiescence, diffuse sleep-spindle-like
waveforms are captured.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate up to 120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute portable EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate up to 120
