CLINICAL HISTORY:  Change in mental status
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Dilantin, insulin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the EEG includes a sleep pattern with a low voltage, slow pattern or features of stage 2 sleep.  When unstimulated, the patient drifts into more of a low voltage beta pattern.  Brief arousals were noted with tactile stimulation with a glimpse of a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm present bilaterally.  As the recording continues additional waveforms of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles were identified.
Heart rate 108 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Essentially continuous stage 2 sleep.
Generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is compatible with pharmacologic sedation.  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat study is suggested.
