METABOLIC,ELECTROLYTE DISTURBANCE. PMHX. MS NO H/O SZ. 54 CM HEAD
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 16 hours from 12/18/2015 to 12/19/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
