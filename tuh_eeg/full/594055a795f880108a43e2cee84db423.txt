CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old male with declining memory, now talking to himself.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed but hyperventilation was not possible.
The patient's name and identity were confirmed by the tech in the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an alpha rhythm of 9.5 Hz.  There is a small amount of theta noted in the background as well as a small degree of shifting, slowing and disorganization.  Features of drowsiness include slowing of the alpha rhythm and a small increase in the intermittent isolated right or left temporal theta or delta.  Other features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing following by vertex waves.
Photic stimulation produces a subtle driving response at intermittent flash frequencies.
Heart rate 96 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to mild background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These EEG findings are nonspecific and support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which could be due to a chronic encephalopathy such as dementia.  There were no epileptiform features noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing sleep is suggested.
