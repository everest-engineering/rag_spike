History:	56 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND DOWN UNRESPONSIVE
KNOWN ETOH ABUSE, CAN 'T MAKE OUT OTHER HX
Medications:	Vancomycin, Thiamine, Norepinephrine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region with attenuation of
faster frequencies.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right temporal region.
This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in
origin. In addition there is marked  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
