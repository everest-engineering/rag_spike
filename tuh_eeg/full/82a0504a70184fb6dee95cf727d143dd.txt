CLINICAL HISTORY:  Recent onset refractory, recurrent seizures, all of which began with left arm numbness or movement.  Patient describes bilateral upper extremity movements without loss of consciousness, but now has began to have events during sleep with incontinence and confusion.  Recent allergic reaction to oxcarbazepine.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.  It was technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  In early drowsiness, the background EEG demonstrates background slowing with slowing of the alpha rhythm, a small degree of disorganization and background theta.  Vertex waves, spindles, and posts were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing some background rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation was remarkable for eye movement artifact, but no significant pathology.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This is the 2nd normal EEG at this institution.
