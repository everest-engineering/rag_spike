History:	61 year old woman who a recent SAH, noted to have gaze deviation this am, concerning for a seizure.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms and voltage attenuation over the left hemisphere.  The background over the right consists of a mixture of moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with additional intermittent Delta activity over the
right temporal region. The background over the left consists of attenuated polymorphic theta Â«delta activity with additional intermittent delta activity over the left temporal region and paucity of faster frequencies. Poorly formed sleep spindles and vertex waves are present. Sleep architecture is better visualized over the right.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli produce change in the background, characterized by appearance of brief diffuse polymorphic delta activity.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate Attenuation , continuous, mild,left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 21-minute EEG in a comatose patient due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left. Additional left hemispheric voltage attenuation is also seen.These findings are indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. No electrographic seizures are present.
Signs of reactivity are seen.
