History:	51 Y/O FEMALE WITH PMHX OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SCHIZOPHRENIA, AND
EPILEPSY. PT STATED THAT SHE HAS HAD SZS SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD. PT
DESCRIBED SZ AS LOC WITH SHAKING WITH TONGUE BITE AND URINARY
INCONTINENCE
Medications:	DILANTIN, KEPPRA, RISPERDAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  hr 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to mild excessive theta in wakefulness. This
finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
