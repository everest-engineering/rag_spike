HISTORY: A 62-year-old woman with lung mass, admitted to an outside hospital with delirium and left-s- subsequently went on to have repetitive seizures on June 25, 2011, and was found to have- subdural abscesses.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode channel of EKG. The patient is very confused and restless.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized. Despite the muscle movement artifact, there are bur- from either hemisphere, but a bit more rhythmic frontal delta is noted from the left. Shifting,- activity is also identified. Underneath this, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Features of delta- beta. There is muscle artifact noted throughout the EEG. On the close of the record, there- in contrast to the initial sections of the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to
1. Moderate background slowing.
2. Prominent shifting, slowing, at times more prominent from the left or right fronto-central region.
3. Frontal irregular rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. Despite the exam features suggesting primarily a process in the right brain, the
EEG is more of a bilateral process. The prominent FIRDA can be seen in a metabolic process, frontal lobe, or deep gray matter pathology. There were no epileptiform features noted.
