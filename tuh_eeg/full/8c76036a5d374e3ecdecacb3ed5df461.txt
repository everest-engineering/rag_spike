CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old left handed woman with a seizure in 7th grade, recurring at age 10 in 5th grade, she was told as a child to avoid hot and spicy foods and her seizures stopped on their own.  Now needs approval to become a bus driver.

MEDICATIONS:  None

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing a small amount of background slowing as well as slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and then slow rolling eye movements in more of a beta pattern.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, but this patient has been seizure free for a decade.
