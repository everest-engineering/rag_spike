CLINICAL HISTORY:  16 year old right handed female with migraine headaches, tremulousness, status post LP in November 2011.  After this she has had persistent back pain, twitches, and tremors, as well as migraine headaches.  She has asthma.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Tylenol, Zyrtec, Imitrex, Naprosyn, Cetirizine, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.
Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were identified.  The patient did not experience the twitching that has been problematic for her.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
