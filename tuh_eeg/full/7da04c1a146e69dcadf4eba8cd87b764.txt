CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with Crohn disease, adult onset, epilepsy, intermittent spells of incoordination or clumsiness.  Past history of B12 related tonic-clonic seizures as the young adult.  Now, with intermittent patches of left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Elavil, Vimpat, Lasix, Pepcid, Elavil, ciprofloxacin, Prilosec, and Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of excess theta noted.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in theta followed by POSTs.  Brief stage 1 sleep includes an increase in beta and POSTs, but sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background and occasional bursts of slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A small amount of excess theta.
Very mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This patient's polypharmacy may contribute to the features described above.
