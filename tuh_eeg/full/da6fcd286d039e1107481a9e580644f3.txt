History:	91 year old woman who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Xanax and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left hemisphere consists of low-to-moderate amplitude 9 Hz PDR, preserved
AP gradient and excess theta activity.  The background over the right consists of 6-7 Hz
polymorphic moderate amplitude posteriorly, preserved AP gradient and excess theta activity.
Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate posterior
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and continuous
focal moderate right posterior quadrant slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in the right posterior quadrant.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
