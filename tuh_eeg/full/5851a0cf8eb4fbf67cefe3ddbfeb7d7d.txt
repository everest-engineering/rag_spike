HISTORY: 27 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 11. The
patient experiences headaches prior to her seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz symmetric,
reactive, posterior dominant rhythm. The overall background includes a modest amount
of background 6 Hz to 7 Hz beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record
producing rhythmic slowing. This is followed by a drowsy pattern with occasional
POSTS. Brief vertex waves are note but sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits
brief driving response.
HR: 72 bpm
Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Small amount of excess theta.
CLINICAL In the previous EEG available for review, the patient was
excessively drowsy. Today, that pattern was not seen. Drowsiness or utilization of other
medications may produce the theta described above. The 2 EEGs available today did
not identify epileptiform activity.
