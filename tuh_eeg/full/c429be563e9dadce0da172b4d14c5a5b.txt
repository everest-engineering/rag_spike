EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and intermixed with a background of anterior predominant rhythmic theta for seconds.  There is
some variability in the record but no reactivity.  At one point the patient bit down on the ET tube
and there was no major change to the background activity.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
