CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed woman with previous Intracerebral
hemorrhage followed by seizure free state and then recurrent seizures which appeared
to be a complex partial like phenomenon. Now seizure free.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Enalapril, Furosemide, ASA, lantus, Nifedipine, Atenolol,
Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a reasonably
well organized pattern on the right with a low voltage 9 Hertz alpha rhythm. The left
hemisphere demonstrates intermittent, somewhat paroxysmal rhythmic delta. This is
sharply contoured with a phase reversal at T1. As the patient becomes a little bit
drowsy some of it shifts a bit posteriorly. Photic stimulation is performed at the end of
the record producing scant driving. The focal slowing Is In the left mid to posterior
temporal region at the end of the record as she becomes drowsy.
HR: 72 bpm and somewhat irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharply contoured focal slowing occurring in bursts in the left mid to posterior
temporal region.
CLINICAL In comparison to previous EEGs, there are no sharp
waves, no spikes, no PLEDS and overall this is an improved pattern.
