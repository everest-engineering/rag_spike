CLINICAL HISTORY:  severe, refractory status epilepticus
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Versed 14, and propofol 80.
INTRODUCTION:  This is the 11th day of continuous video EEG monitoring with seizure and spike detection for this individual with Rasmussen encephalitis and refractory focal seizures, status post treatment with steroids, IVIG, Solu-Medrol, and rituximab.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG begins with a continuous pattern with prominent epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere particularly T5 and P3.  Over the course of the day, medications are titrated upwards and by 7 p.m. briefly suppressed in discontinuous pattern was noted.  In the overnight recording, the EEG becomes continuous again and in fact, there is vigorous fast activity noted from the right hemisphere, and even a suggestion of some sharp activity in the right hemisphere, particularly C4 and P4.  The primary area of epileptogenicity is the left central parietal region however.  As the patient transitions out of the burst suppression pattern at 9:00 p.m., vigorous fast activity was noted from the right hemisphere, which may accentuate the sharply contoured features noted from the right.  Medications continued to be titrated upwards, but in the later sections of the record, the EEG is increasingly continuous with the prominent epileptiform activity and fast activity in the left parietal region.
Heart rate 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring and the use of status epilepticus medications to obtain a burst suppression pattern and suppressed epileptiform activity were only transiently successful.  These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
