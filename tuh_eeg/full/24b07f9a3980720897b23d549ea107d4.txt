CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since childhood and a seizure on 05/30/2010 with left-sided weakness followed by generalized tonic clonic seizures.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined, 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with brief vertex waves and then arousal. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
