CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis with coagulopathy, involuntary tremulousness, acute anemia, and exacerbation of migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Copaxone, Coumadin, Paxil, Anaprox, others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. No clinical events were recorded during this portion of the EEG.  The patient received multiple therapies for her MS and anemia during the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial portions of the record demonstrate rhythmic background theta in wakefulness.  Later portions of the record demonstrate a marked improvement in the background with a normal awake pattern and an alpha rhythm of 10 Hz..
Sleep was characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Initially abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with multiple medications, migraine headaches, and severe anemia, the initial background slowing may be due to either of these processes.  The normal pattern at the close would suggest improvement in this dynamic process.
