AGE: 76 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/17/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1679
HISTORY:
76 y.o. female with a history of HIV and TB meningitis, with several weeks of altered mental status and a seizure on 10/9/2015.	This is a follow up study requested after an episode of unresponsiveness this morning.
MEDICATIONS: Valproic acid SEDATION: None listed
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous and symmetric, but poorly organized, consisting of theta, alpha, and delta frequencies. There is no posterior dominant rhythm.
Drowsiness and sleep are not clearly captured. There is moderate generalized slowing.
There is no focal slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Â·
Abundant right posterior quadrant (T6 and P4 max)
sharp-and-wave discharges. Occasionally these become periodic at 1 Hz for -6 runs.
Very frequent independent left posterior quadrant (TS and P3 max) sharp-and-wave discharges. These often distribute more broadly over the left hemisphere.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake only	routine EEG due to:
Moderate generalized slowing and background disorganization
Abundant right posterior quadrant (T6 and P4 max)
sharp-and-wave discharges. Occasionally these become periodic at 1 Hz for -6 runs.
Very frequent independent left posterior quadrant (TS and P3 max) sharp-and-wave discharges. These often distribute more broadly over the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction and at least two potentially epileptogenic foci: right posterior quadrant (more prevalent) and left posterior quadrant. There were no electrographic seizures captured.
