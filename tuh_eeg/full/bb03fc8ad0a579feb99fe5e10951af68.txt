Medications:	Keppra, Phenobarbital, Heparin, Dexamethasone, metformin, risperdal, insulin,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background was characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eye
opening intermixed with arrhythmic delta activity and sharply contoured slowing.  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity was present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  As drowsiness
progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Almost continuous polymorphic delta activity was present in the right frontocentral and temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There was right hemispheric breach
rhythm.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 100-110 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Breach artifact, right
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing at times with sharply contoured
morphology and slow alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  continuous focal slowing in the right central and temporal regions.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. Breach artifact is consistent with a
history of craniotomy.  No electrographic seizures are present.  Please note that the patient is
