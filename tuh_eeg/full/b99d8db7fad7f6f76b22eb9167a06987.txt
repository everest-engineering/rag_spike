CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old woman with hypertension and diabetes, asthma, stent and left-sided weakness which began 2 years ago.
MEDICATIONS: Actos, Metoprolol, Simvastatin, Plavix, Nateglinide.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed but there is no hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz 50 microvolt,
posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm as well as occasional focal slowing in the right frontotemporal region. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits a supra harmonic driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing identified in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. No
epileptiform features were observed.
