CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed male with epilepsy since early childhood, vagal nerve stimulator for the past five years. Seizure free since July. Now infrequent seizures characterized by staring. Previous EEG's demonstrating epileptiform process from either hemisphere.

MEDICATIONS:  Zonegram, Lamictal

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a scant amount of theta in the background, and the overall organization is at the limits of normal for an adult of this age. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increase in slowing which is slightly asymmetric. In hyperventilation, overall background is sharply contoured, but there are no definitive sharp waves or spikes. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR:    48 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Small amount of theta.
2. A slightly disorganized record for age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   There is some slight shifting asymmetries and hyperventilation but none sustained. No epileptiform features were identified. This is similar to previous interictal EEG's for this individual.
