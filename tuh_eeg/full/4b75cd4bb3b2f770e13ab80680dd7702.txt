History:	53 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ONSET 2011 S/P RT STROKE. SZ
OCCUR ARE WITH VISUAL AURA, TINGLING OF MOUTH, SHAKING, THEN
SHAKING. EVOLVES INTO GEN SHAKING LASTING 2-3 MIN. PT AWARE OF
SURROUNDING DURING SZ.
Medications:	KEPPRA, LABETALOL, ZANTAC, VALIUM, TOPAMAX, SENNA, VASOTEC,
BENADRYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to show vertex waves and symmetric sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 5 to 13 fps.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21 minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
