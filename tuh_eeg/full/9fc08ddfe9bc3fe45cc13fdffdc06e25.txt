REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76 -year-old woman found to have speech difficulties as well as has weakness, found to have multiple brain metastasis and a left apical lung mass.  Most recently had an episode of right facial twitching, last one in December 2012.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, hydrochlorothiazide, Norvasc, triamterene, dexamethasone, insulin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta. The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharged.
HEART RATE:  66.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously at C3 and occasionally at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left central and sometimes midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left central and at times, left mid temporal region, which is consistent with the known tumor.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
