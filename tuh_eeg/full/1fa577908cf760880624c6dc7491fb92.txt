AGE: 46 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 10/16/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1535
HISTORY:
46 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy	And NES referred for routine EEG.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
calcium-vitamin D (OYSTER SHELL CALCIUM-VIT D3) 500 mg(l,250mg)
-200 unit per tablet, TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY DAY
LORAZEPAM PO, Take	by mouth.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity , organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Bilateral wicket was seen.	Intermittent left, right or bilateral theta was noted
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Two right temporal sharp waves were seen
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
Bilateral paroxysmal temporal theta,
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are	performed.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is abnormal Awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
Two right temporal sharp waves
Independent right or left or bilateral paroxysmal theta
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is ab normal Awake and drowsy routine EEG, with findings similar to the many prior studies which have included right or left temporal sharp waves.
This	EEG does support the diagnosis of epilepsy.
