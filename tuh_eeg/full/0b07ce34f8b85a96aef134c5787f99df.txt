CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed woman with increasing seizures since January with 1 to 4 seizures per month tonic-clonic with tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Trileptal, Ibuprofen
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a background with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm as well as some 6 Hz theta frequency activity. There is a small amount of shifting slowing in the temporal regions. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation produces scant driving. The shifting slowing is a bit more prominent in the left temporal region and is sharply contoured.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Shifting slowing in the left temporal region.
2. Excess theta activity.
3. Suspicious left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been identified in this patient's 2 previous EEGs. If seizures are poorly controlled, an inpatient EEG monitoring sessions may be helpful to more completely characterize her epileptiform activity.
