History:	40 y/o woman epileptic since about 13yo.  Last sz about 2wks ago. EEG to test to
see how meds are working. Rule out seizures.
Medications:	DIVALPROEX, LAMOTRIGINE, LEVOTHYROXINE, MECLIZINE, SIMVASTATIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 66  Head rocking artifact was noted in
the occipital region.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, movement, continuous, left occipital
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
