CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an this is an 81-year-old male, status post elective knee replacement surgery, who started having right arm shaking intermittently with change in mental status with past medical history significant for epilepsy on valproic acid, hypertension, and dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Valproic acid.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the sedated state (status post 4 mg of IV Ativan), there was diffuse attenuation and slowing of the background activity with intermittent EKG artifact.  There was seen a low voltage 1.5 Hz delta frequency activity intermixed with 4-5 Hz theta frequency.  There was a spontaneous variability and reactivity on stimulating the patient.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.  Heart rate was 90 to 110 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a long-term EEG recording capturing the patient in a lethargic, sedated state due to diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background are suggestive of severe encephalopathy. It could be due to severe metabolic or infectious encephalopathy or due to effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  In addition, diffuse attenuation could be seen in bilateral fluid collection in the extra-axial space or the overlying scalp.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.
