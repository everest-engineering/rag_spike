History:	61 YR FEMALE WITH LONG H/O SZS PRESENTS WITH CC OF SZ.  CT. CHRONIC
LEFT PCA/ACA/MCA INF.  PMHX:  SZS, DM, CVA, HEADACHES
Medications:	TOPAMAX,KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
There is right -to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with paucity of faster frequencies and voltage
attenuation over the left hemisphere.  Over the right hemisphere, the posterior dominant rhythm
consists of a well-formed 9-Hz alpha activity with good anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude
gradient.  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm over the left.  The background over the left
hemisphere consists of a very low amplitude theta and delta activity.  As drowsiness progresses,
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Focal slowing and attenuation of the left hemisphere
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of moderate focal left hemispheric slowing
and attenuation. This finding is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in
etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of
