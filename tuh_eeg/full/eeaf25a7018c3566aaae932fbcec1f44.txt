History:	30 YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH FIRST GENERALIZED SEIZURE ON FRIDAY 5/31/14. OTHERWISE IN GOOD HEALTH.
Medications:	Tegretol, keppra, tramadol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present intermittently, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Frequently the EEG is disorganized with loss of the normal A-P gradient.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal  regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal  region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing and back ground disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
