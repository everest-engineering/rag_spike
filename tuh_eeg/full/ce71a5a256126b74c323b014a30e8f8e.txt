History:	77yo M s/p assault with LOC
Medications:	insulin, ASA, enoxaparin, metoprolol, clindamycin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess theta (6-
7Hz) activity seen in wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves and positive occipital sharp
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 72  Paucity of eye blink.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to excess theta in wakefulness and slowing of
the posterior dominant rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
