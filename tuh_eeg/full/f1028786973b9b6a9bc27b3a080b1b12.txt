History:	24 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF STATUS.  PMHX: MENINGITIS ENCEPHALITIS AT
AGE 3, VNS 2013 (JEFFERSON), IBS,.
Medications:	Propofol, Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Infrequently a posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz  Overall the background activity was
characterized by a disorganized diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Almost continuous focal slowing is present over the right centro-temporal region and bifrontal
regions.  High amplitude epileptiform discharges are seen in the central region at C3/CZ. These
appear in rhythmic bursts.  Frequent bilateral frontal discharges are seen at F7 and F8
independently.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 138
Summary of Findings:
Spikes and sharp waves
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent bifrontal independent as well as central spike and
sharp waves, which are supportive of a multifocal epilepsy.  In addition, diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
