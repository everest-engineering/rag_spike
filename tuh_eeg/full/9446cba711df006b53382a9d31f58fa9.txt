CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old right handed woman with and episode of
lightheadedness, faint feeling, and strange smell on March 26.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Atenolol, Diltiazem, HCTZ, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG
. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is re
low voltage with generous beta. as might be anticipated in an anxious patient
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Feature of
drowsiness include an increase in theta. Photic stimulation is remarkable for
photoelectric artifact.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is without epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a low voltage EEG in an anxious patient. here
was little alpha rhythm but there were no pathological features noted.
