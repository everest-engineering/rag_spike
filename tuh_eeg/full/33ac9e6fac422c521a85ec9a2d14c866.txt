History:	59 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND DOWN AT HOME ON 3/16/14
UNRESPONSIVE. FOUND TO HAVE LARGE BLEED (LT BG ) SENT HERE FROM
JEANS. PMHX SIG FOR DM, HTN, HLD, CVA ( RT POST IC INFARCT ) EEG TO
R/O SZ NOTED WITH LT ARM JERKING.
Medications:	insulin, vancomycin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by asymmetric
slowing and attenuation in delta and theta range more on the left side when compared to the right.
There was intermittent bifrontal sharply-contoured delta activity, 1.5 - 2.5 Hz in frequency, more
pronounced on the right, with no evolution.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory,
tactile, and painful stimuli.  There is a brief episode of left hand shaking commented by the
technician with no EEG correlation.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, bilateral (L>R)
Attenuation, bilateral (L>R)
No alpha rhythm
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and attenuation and lack of
posterior dominant rhythm.  These findings are  indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Hemispheric asymmetry with greater attenuation and slowing on the left could be due to left-sided
ICH with cerebral edema. Clinical correlation is recommended.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures are present. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.
