CLINICAL HISTORY: 87 year old right handed male found down with multiple seizures. Past frontal craniotomy.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan 8 mg plus 2 more in the emergency room, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive but not intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow relatively low voltage, featureless record. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact in the background, but when the muscle drops out, there is a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity in the left frontal region. Shivering produces a great deal of muscle artifact and is more prominent in the later sections of the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breech rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy and may accentuate frontal delta. No epileptiform features were noted.
