CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed woman with nocturnal epilepsy since 2008, past history of daily nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hertz dominant rhythm. There are numerous epileptiform features in this record including focal, independent, right or temporal sharp waves, sharp waves that are maximum in A2 rather than at T1, T2 and other bursts that are frontally predominate spike wave activity as well as right greater than left frontal sharp waves. There are bursts of paroxysmal slowing noted in the record and a bit more arrhythmic delta from the right temporal region with the predominate right temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does appear to elicit a driving response although the epileptiform activity continues through.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to: 1. Predominate epileptiform activity in nearly every 10 second particularly from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been previously identified although the epileptiform activity is much more prominent on the right. This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic process in this individual who is currently seizure free. If the patient is thought to have funny spells of any type, additional testing may be of value.
