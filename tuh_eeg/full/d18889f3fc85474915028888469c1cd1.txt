CLINICAL HISTORY:  74 year old woman with NICMP, hypertension, right intraventricular hemorrhage, and decreased responsiveness, possible seizures and cardiac dysrhythmia.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ceftriaxone and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is diffusely slow but the patient transitions in and out of a drowsy state with varying amounts of beta.  There is small, shifting asymmetries noted.  Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening.
HR:    90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
Shifting beta asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  This EEG is more supportive of a bihemispheric process.
