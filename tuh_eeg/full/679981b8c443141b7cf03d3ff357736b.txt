AGE: 51 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE : Routine , coma study EEG #: 15-1357
HISTORY:
51 y.o. male with a history of seizures presenting with multiple seizures.
MEDICATIONS: propofol , ativan (10 mg total), rocuronium, Keppra , Dilantin
SEDATION: As above TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is composed of a symmetric and continuous but disorganized mixture of alpha, beta, and theta, with admixed
delta.	There is no definite reactivity to noxious stimuli. At times the frontal beta activity is sharply contoured.
Moderate generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No definite epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed Photic Stimulation : Not performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:
Moderate generalized slowing
Disorganized background
No definite reactivity to- noxious stimuli
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate at least moderate cerebral dysfunction, which is likely at least in part due to sedating medication.
