History:	55 Y/O WOMAN WITH PMHX OF PARRY ROMBERG SYNDROME, AND SZS. SZ
STARTED ONCE DIAGNOSED WITH PARRY ROMBERG 30 YRS AGO. MOST
RECENT SZ DESCRIBED AS HOLLERING, LASTING ABOUT 30 SECS. LAST
EPISODE TODAY
Medications:	CARBATROL, DEPAKOTE, KEPPRA, REMERON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions during
wakefulness.  Frequent sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at
F7/T3, C3, T4 and C4.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good
cooperation, and produces no effect.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, Multifocal bilateral temporal and central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the bilateral temporal
and central region as well as diffuse slowing.  These findings are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic foci in these regions and along with the diffuse slowing are consistent  with a
diagnosis of multifocal epilepsy.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
