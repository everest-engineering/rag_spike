CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed male with a 2-year history of seizures loss
of consciousness. His last seizure was in February 2011. Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, CAD,
pacemaker.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Insulin, Endocet, Phenytoin, Niaspan, Levetiracetam ,
Carvedilol, ASA, Tricor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 s stem of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed but
stimulation was completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an
rhythm of 7 Hz, 30 microvolts. The alpha rhythm is somewhat asymmetric, drops out the
right earlier than the left as the patient becomes drowsy, and is somewhat more on
the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
slowing with occasional bursts of FIRDA. Occasional spindles are noted. The falling
asleep during photic simulation. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Slowing of t e alpha rhythm.
3. Asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL There were no epileptiform features identified. The back
slowing is a nonspecific pattern and may be due to toxic or metabolic by a
hemisphere disturbance. The disruption of faster frequency activity on the right may
correlated with imaging. Consideration for a structural or functional abnormality on the right is
appropriate.
