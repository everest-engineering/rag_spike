History:	35 YO FEMALE TRANSFER FROM JEANES 1 WK AFTER SZ. PT HAD SZ IN BED
2/7 AND DOES NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING UNTIL IN JEANES ICU. PREVIOUS
SZ MORE THAN 1 YEAR AGO, RECENTLY HAD 3 SZ'S. PT ON DIALYSIS 3X A
WEEK.
Medications:	CLONIDINE, HYDROMORPHONE, CLINDAMYCIN, HYDRALAZINE, ISORDIL,
METHYLPREDNISOLONE.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
Posterior dominant rhythm was at best 7Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At
times some waveforms had a triphasic like morphology.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
