History:	57 Y/O MALE R HANDED. PT. STATES HE HAS NOT HAD A SZ. IN 31 YRS.
WHEN HE DID HAVE SZ. (GRAND MAL) PMHX. HEP C, 28 YRS CLEAN DRUG AND
ETOH ABUSE. PT WAS HIT IN HEAD ON LEFT SIDE OF HEAD FRONTAL
CENTRAL,APRITEL,OCC. 57 CM HEAD
Medications:	PHENOBARBITAL, VALPROIC ACID,CLONAZEPAM,CARBAMAZEPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was at best 8Hz seen bilaterally.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere mainly int the temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry with an increased
amplitude in the entire left frontocentral and temporal region consistent with a breach.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Breach artifact, continuous, left frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing and breach in the left
hemisphere mainly in the frontal central region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
