TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is seen mainly in sleep, however, in limited wakefulness there is a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz.  There is normal frontal central beta.  There is multiple bursts of RMTD, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep mainly.
Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None, although there was one single focal slow wave throughout the entire recording.  This was seen in the left temporal region.
