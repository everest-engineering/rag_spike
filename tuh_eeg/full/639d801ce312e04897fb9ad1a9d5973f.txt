History:	33YO MALE PMH: ESRD ON DIALYSIS , HTN, LAST SEIZURE WAS IN 12/11.
BROUGHT TO ED FOR CARDIAC ARREST.PT STOPPED BREATHING AND
HEART STOPPED LASTING 20 MINUTES.
Medications:	NITROPRUSSIDE, FENOLDOPAM, SODIUM CHLORIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by an almost
completely suppressed electrocerebral activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Intermittent irregular high amplitude frontal predominant generalized
poly-spike and wave discharges lasting 1-2 seconds with associated blinking eye movement most
consistent with myoclonus.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  An almost continuous ventilator
artifact was present.  HR was 114.
Summary of Findings:
Polyspike-and-wave complexes, intermittent generalized
Attenuation, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent generalized frontal predominant polyspike-and-
wave discharges with associated eye myoclonus and  diffuse severe background attenuation. This
findings are indicative of severe diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability. In the setting of hypoxic
injury these findings forebode a poor prognosis.
