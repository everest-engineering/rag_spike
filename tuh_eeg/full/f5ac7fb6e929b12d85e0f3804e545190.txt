CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old woman with tonic-clonic seizures for the past 8 years or 1 month ago characterized by a funny feeling with internal tremors. Past history of stroke with left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Folic Acid, Phenytoin, Celexa, Ozybuly (?), Citalopram
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a lower voltage pattern with 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of beta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles. Mild asymmetries are noted in stage II sleep with a somewhat lower amplitude pattern in the right frontotemporal region than the left.
HR: 66 bpm
Minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slight amplitude asymmetry noted in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Previous EEGs were not available for comparison. If epilepsy is an important consideration, an additional recording may be of use.
