CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 74-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension for thrombectomy, history of gout, AFib, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Rocuronium, isoflurane, Versed, and fentanyl.
INTRODUCTION:  Six hours digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the OR using standard operative montage.  The EKG lead was not utilized.  The recording begins with the patient awake in the OR.  Recording was intermittently paused for Bovie.
Remote review physician time:  4 hours 45 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient is awake in the OR with a well organized 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Induction of anesthesia and intubation was started at 08:45 a.m. and by 9 a.m., there is a symmetric, rhythmic pattern with generous beta and lower voltage delta.
Cooling began 47 minutes after the start of the study at 11:39.  The EEG is very low voltage, nearly suppressed with intermittent bursts of delta particularly 11:41.  By 12:08, the EEG was suppressed.  The target temperature was 19.8 and was achieved.
There is a low voltage artifact noted intermittently in the record.
At 01:19, the technologist alerts the team an isolated bursts of delta followed by more sustained and isolated burst of delta at 01:31.  The team confirms that the head had been rewarmed and the head is cooled again.
Rewarming begins shortly after 2 p.m. with a low voltage pattern noted at 02:21.  The EEG concluded at 02:32 with a brain activity emerging with a lower voltage continuous theta delta pattern.
IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring during this pulmonary thrombectomy with hypothermia was remarkable for:
The achievement of a suppressed pattern.
With rewarming the reappearance of cerebral activity.
