Medications:	PHENOBARBITAL,DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess theta activity, 7 Hz in frequency, during wakefulness.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region (T3/T1) during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR 80
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate amounts, Excess theta
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Intermittent
focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.
