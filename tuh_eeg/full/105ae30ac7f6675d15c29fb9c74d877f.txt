PULMONARY THROMBOENDARTERECTOMY
Medications:	INDUCTION MEDS: ETOMIDATE, SUCCINYLCHOLINE, FENTANYL, VERSED,
VECURONIUM. OTHERS: FLURANE, NITRO, EPI
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As the surgery progressed the EEG revealed a background  which consists
of a continuous mixture of diffuse delta with interposed beta. This background slowly became
slower some periodic sharp waves are seen over the right anterior temporal region and then
become generalized. The background continued  to become more diffusely attenuated as the
patient is cooled until the it became symmetrically completely isoelectric.  The EEG remains
Isoelectric for hours and then as the patient is warmed the background slowly become a symmetric
mixture of delta frequencies with some frontal beta until the end of the record.  BODY COOLING:

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 5.4 hour EEG during cooling for a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
