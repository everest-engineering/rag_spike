Technologist:
History:	25 year man admitted with drug overdose
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
No clear posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  During sleep, there is diffuse voltage attenuation, resolution of diffuse delta activity
and rare diffuse vertex-like waveforms.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up to ~ 110 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Other, background is reactive with arousals and sleep-like cycles
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  Clear evidence of reactivity and sleep/wake cycles indicate favorable
prognosis for recovery of at least some neurological function.
