History:	61YR MALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES, SZ FREE FOR YRS THEN END OF DEC
HAD 2 SZS.  PMHX: HEART FAILURE, PACEMAKER.   (1ST SZ 12/27 WHILE
FISHING 2ND SZ 12/29 POST SHOVELING SNOW).
Medications:	KEPPRA, DEPAKOTE, PRADAXA.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Alpha rhythm and background activity are low voltage (10-25uV), but show
normal reactivity to eye opening and attenuate with drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces a minimal symmetric photic driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21 minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
