CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 82-year-old gentleman with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness, fall, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  No clinical seizures were noted by the team and no seizures were noted by the computerized spike detection software.
TECHNICAL:  This is a satisfactory study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In comparison to previous sections of the record, there is less in the way of background theta.  Although there is some head rocking artifacts, as the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there is intermittent, left hemispheric subtle focal slowing.  Sleep is characterized by spindles and posts.
Heart rate:  72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This first 24 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Absence of interictal epileptiform discharges.
Absence at clinical seizures.
An overall improvement of the background.
Intermittent, subtle focal slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  One more day of EEG recording is planned.
