History:	49 YR FEMALE HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.
Medications:	VERSED, DOPAMINE, MIDAZOLAM, NOREPINEPHRINE, INSULIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
obtunded, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the # Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
This EEG captures the patient during the cooled phase. No posterior dominant rhythm was present. The is profound attenuation and suppression of the background cerebral activity.  There is excessive bilateral muscle artifact seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  There is no clinical movement observed.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, severe, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG because of severe amplitude suppression and absence of any normal cerebral activity.  These findings are typical of a patient undergoing therapeutic
