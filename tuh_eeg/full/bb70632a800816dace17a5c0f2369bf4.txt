History:	52 YR MALE WITH EPISODE OF GTC SZ. FOUND USING K2 SYNTHETIC DRUG.
IN ED WITNESSED GTC. LIP BITE. AGGRESSION POST ICTAL. X30 MIN. GIVEN 4
MG ATIVAN.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, frequent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
