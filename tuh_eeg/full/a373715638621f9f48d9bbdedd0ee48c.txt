CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 85-year-old male with left subdural hematoma, aphasia, rule out seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Xarelto, Lexapro, metoprolol, lisinopril, and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive initially, but does know where he is and answers questions.  The patient was described as quite hard of hearing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is quite drowsy with a diffusely slow pattern with lower voltage mixed delta and theta.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response and the patient follows commands.  The awake pattern is somewhat disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm ranging from 7-8 Hz, 30 mV.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, a subtle asymmetry is noted with a bit more slow delta in the left hemisphere, relevant to the right.
Heart rate irregular, 72-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Generalized background slowing.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Subtle asymmetry and drowsiness with a bit more slowing noted on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The subtle focal features noted on the left may be correlated with imaging.
