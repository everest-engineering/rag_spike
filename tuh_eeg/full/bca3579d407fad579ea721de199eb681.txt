History:	71 year old man who has a history of seizures and strokes, now presents with
Medications:	 VALIUM AND ATIVAN, DILANTIN DURING THE RECORDING
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of slow attenuated polymorphic delta
activity.  Occasional diffuse frontally predominant activity in a high sleep-spindle range is captured.
No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  With stimulation, there is change in the
background characterized by appearance of diffuse low-to-moderate amplitude fast activity.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL comatose portable 21-minute EEG due to severe diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There
