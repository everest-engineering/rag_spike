CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed male with asthma and epilepsy, 7-year old history of epilepsy, seizure free until he received generic seizure medications while incarcerated. Typical tonic clonic seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Albuterol, Cyclobenzaprine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10Hz 50 mV alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of alpha with rhythmic theta pattern in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.

HR: 78bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
