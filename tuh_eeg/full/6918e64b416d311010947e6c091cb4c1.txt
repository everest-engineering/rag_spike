CLINICAL HISTORY 63 year old female admitted on April 20, 2011 with acute left sided
weakness, malignant stroke with edema, requiring right craniectomy. Evaluate for persistent
unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Vancomycin, Lasix, Levothyroxine, Folic Acid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient Is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a pattern of medium
amplitude theta and delta. There are shifting asymmetries. In some sections of the record,
there is more a pattern of theta delta activity on the right compared to the left with the left
demonstrating a scant amount of alpha frequency activity. Other sections demonstrate the
converse pattern with some sharply contoured slowing in the left frontotemporal region. The
activity from the left is also higher amplitude than that from the right Stimulation of the patient
does seem to produce an increase in theta frequency activity, particularly from the left, with
some 4 and 6 Hz activity noted.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. More of a theta delta pattern.
2. Shifting asymmetries with a lower voltage pattern on the right compared to the left.
3. Some shifting slowing, somewhat sharply contoured, in the left frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In light of the right craniectomy and massive right MCA infarct, the
lower voltage pattern on the right is an anticipated finding. The bilateral slowing and the slow
pattern on the left ma y account for the bihemispheric pattern of unresponsiveness.
