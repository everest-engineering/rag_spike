CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old male in to evaluate for anoxic encephalopathy. ·
·MEDICATIONS: Clonidine, Lisinopril, Amiodarone, Amlodipine, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated with
head deviation to the right and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation
are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly
slow background with delta and theta frequency activity. In addition, there are
intermittent bursts of left 1. 7 Hz sharply contoured slowing with an F7-T1 phase
reversal Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR: 88 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.

2. Bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the left anterior temporal region.
3. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral
dysfunction. The sharp waves raise the possibility of a localization related mechanism
for epilepsy.
