History:	70 year old woman with limb jerking for several hours.  Patient has a history of
ESRD on HD.  She has missed last two HD sessions.
Medications:	Heparin, insulin, zosyn, vancomycin, asa, keppra,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The PDR is 6-7 Hz activity and AP gradient is weak.  The background consists of irregular
polymorphic theta activity.  Patient is asleep throughout the recording with poorly formed vertex
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  Various limb and mouth movements are captured
throughout the recording have no abnormal ictal correlate.  Irregular heart rate is noted on a single
EKG lead with inter-QRS pauses up to 1.5 seconds long.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Cardiac arrhythmia, Irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead with inter-QRS pauses up
Other, Various limb and mouth movements are captured throughout the recording have no
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and mostly asleep 23-minute EEG because of mild-to-moderate
diffuse background slowing and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Various limb and mouth movements
are captured throughout the recording have no abnormal ictal correlate.
