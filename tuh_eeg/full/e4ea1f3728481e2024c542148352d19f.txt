AGE: 31 y.o.
SEX: male
START DATE OF STUDY: 09/30/2015 at 15:42 END DATE OF STUDY: 10/1/2015 at 15:12
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: video LTM
EEG #: 15-271.1 (271.1: 95951; 271.2: 95951)
HISTORY:
31 y.o. Male with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p cardiac arrest referred for EEG for cooling protocol.
MEDICATIONS: Dilaudid, vancomycin, insulin, zosyn SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited study during Day 1 (see below) and included a single channel of EKG.
DAY 1 (9/30/2015, 15:42 - 10/1/2015, 08:00)
BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly organized, and consists of a mixture of delta, theta, and alpha.
There is no posterior dominant rhythm.
At the study start, the background is not clearly reactive, nor variable.
There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.
*Periods of high frequency artifact obscure all leads for the majority of the study on this day. Beginning at 10/1 05:50, the periods of high frequency muscle artifact break up. Periods of background consisting of disorganized alpha and beta with eye blink artifact are then seen.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present .
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal, though technically limited, video EEG due to:
Moderate diffuse slowing, which improves to mild diffuse slowing at the end of this day
Suboptimal organization
DAY 2 (10/1/2015, 08:00 - 10/1/2015, 15:12)
BACKGROUND: mildly disorganized mixture of alpha and beta in wake; theta slowing in sleep without sleep architecture
No definite posterior dominant rhythm or sleep transients are seen
GENERALIZED SLOWING: mild FOCAL SLOWING: none
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Mild diffuse slowing
Suboptimal organization
FINAL IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Moderate diffuse slowing, which improves to mild diffuse slowing by Day 2
Suboptimal organization of the background
FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which improves over the course of the study from "moderate" to "mild."
Note that the study is technically limited for most of Day 1.
