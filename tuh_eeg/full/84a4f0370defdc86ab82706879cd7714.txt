History:	77 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE W/
? SZ ACTIVITY. PMHX SIG FOR HTN, DM-NIDDM
Medications:	FENTANYL, VERSED NICARDIPINE IN ED, MIDAZOLAM, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 90  Technical difficulties: Marked muscle artifact during a large
portion of the study.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
