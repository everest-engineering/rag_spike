CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 34-year-old left-handed male with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness with shaking, tongue biting, and incontinence lasting 10-15 minutes.  These occur in addition to intermittent headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Baclofen, Zoloft, Prilosec, oxycodone, lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with low-to-medium amplitude, 10 Hz alpha rhythm and generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta followed by rhythmic central theta and brief vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  The patient seemed to be falling asleep during hyperventilation.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This patient's medications might play a role in the generous beta described above.
