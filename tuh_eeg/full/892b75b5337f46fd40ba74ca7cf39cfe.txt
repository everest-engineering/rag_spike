CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old woman with HIV disease, deaf-mule, CNS toxoplasmosis, seizure in 08/2010.

MEDICATIONS: Leucovorin, Loratadine, Norvir, Keppra, ASA, Baclofen, Colace, Daraprim, Eumat, Imodium, Isentress,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is quite low voltage but there is an 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There are bursts of sharply contoured rhythmic theta noted particularly from the left temporal region with a suspicious underlying left temporal sharp wave, but there is some more rhythmic appearing theta which can be identified bilaterally. The background EEG demonstrates intermittent bursts of sharply contoured slowing from the right or left temporal region. This activity includes some delta as well as some more rhythmic activity as can be seen In a patient with an underlying normal variant such as wicket. Vertex waves are observed In stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: N/A

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small degree of rhythmic background slowing in wakefulness.
2. Occasional bursts of higher amplitude more irregular sharp contoured slowing in the right or left temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports at least a mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function as might be seen in an underlying CNS, HIV The sharply contoured bursts
of slowing seen in the left temporal regions may be correlated with imaging. No spikes were seen and if further information is needed a more prolonged record capturing additional sleep may be helpful.
