CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old right handed woman with history of diabetes, Alzheimer's, hyperlipidemia, complains of 2 episodes of syncope in the shower.
MEDICATIONS:  Janumet, Zocor, ASA, Namenda, Donepezil, Trazodone, Folic Acid.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Possible seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta. Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges. The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
