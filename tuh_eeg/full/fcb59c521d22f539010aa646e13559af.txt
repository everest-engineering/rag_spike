CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old left handed woman with a past history of HIV, stroke, loss of consciousness, admitted on the 12th with dysarthria, visual scintillations for 30 minutes.  Left frontal stroke, chronic renal disease, and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Intelence, Amlodipine, Valsartan, HCTZ, Labetalol, Atovaquone, Proguanil, Phoslo, Prezista, Bicitra, Isentress, Norvir, ASA, Heparin, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 to 9.2 Hz.  This is approximately 40 microvolts.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing as well as some paroxysmal bursts of bilateral 5 to 7 Hz theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not noted.  Hyperventilation seems to produce a bit of shifting slowing.  Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep.  There is little driving response.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal slowing.
Occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above were previously noted including the shifting slowing.  The features of paroxysmal slowing are nonspecific and can be seen in a metabolic encephalopathy or a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function
as can be seen in renal failure or HIV infection.  The shifting slowing may be correlated with a previous stroke.
