CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old right handed woman with multiple strokes and
seizures, followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, ASA, Atenolol, Norvasc
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed. This was an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG
demonstrates a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of background theta and
a small amount of shifting theta. Wicket is observed in drowsiness, particularly around
the same time periods as the shifting arrhythmic delta activity. There is also some 5 Hz,
flat top shape characteristic movement in temporal state of drowsiness noted. Photic
stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, the background is
better organized and there is less in the way of arrhythmic delta activity. In this
individual with multiple strokes, the shifting arrhythmic delta activity supports a bihemisphere pathology. There is no definitive epileptiform activity in any of the EEGs
thus far, but if seizures are an ongoing issue, a repeat study capturing stage 2 sleep would be advised given the presence of normal variant, such as wicket.
