CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an elderly 68-year-old male with subacute left MCA infarct admitted with generalized weakness, acute confusion, and transient and inexplicable left arm weakness with right facial droop.  Slurred speech.  Hypertension.  MI.  Hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin, isosorbide dinitrate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake who was unhappy to have an EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm but there is excess theta noted bilaterally.  Frequent eye blink and muscle artifact were observed in this awake EEG.
Heart rate irregular 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:  Mild excess 6 hertz data.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  There were no significant focal features noted.  The mild background theta described above is a nonspecific finding.  In this individual with a history of significant cerebrovascular ischemia, this is a relatively unremarkable EEG and is without significant focal features.  If additional information is needed, recording capturing sleep may be helpful.
