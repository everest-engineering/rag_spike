CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory seizures with loss of awareness.  In addition, left-sided headaches and an abnormal MRI.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reports a 10/10 headache with photophobia and nausea and left scalp aches.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the record demonstrates stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles.  Wakefulness is observed by 6 p.m. and a normal awake background is noted.  The patient is back to sleep by 8 p.m., although she is intermittently awake during the night.  Head rocking movement is noted in the background.
The seizure and spike detector are reviewed.  No epileptiform abnormalities are observed.
INTERVAL IMPRESSION:  Normal 24-hour EEG monitoring.  Study remarkable for a patient whose headache seems to be better on the second day.  She is more awake during the day and seems to be more comfortable overall.
