PMHX: ESRD, COPD, PVD, HTN, CAD, BLADDER CA, PHTN, L COMMON ILIAC
STENT (2012).
Medications:	FLAGYL, ALBUTEROL, IPRATROPIUM, CEFTRIAXONE, PANTOPRAZOLE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is an asymmetry where the left hemisphere appears to be diffusely attenuated delta activity.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region at F4/C4.  Occasional
focal sharp waves are present in the right frontal region, with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at F4.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontal
Sharp waves, intermittent, right frontal
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG. There is evidence of focal right frontal structural dysfunction and
irritability, which is consistent with a lesion in that region. In addition there is evidence of left
hemispheric cortical structural dysfunction , which may due to a large ischemic lesion, mass or
possibly a fluid collection over that region. Lastly there is evidence of  diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
