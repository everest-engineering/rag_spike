History:		59 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH POSSIBLE OVERDOSE. NOTED WITH TWITCHING LT HAND/FACE.  EEG TO RIO SZ.
Medications:	Versed in ED Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes,  comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally predominant intermixed 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was mild muscle reactivity to painful stimuli. HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse, Disorganized Excessive fast, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL  EEG because of diffuse background slowing, disorganization and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
