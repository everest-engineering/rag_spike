CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old woman with a lifelong history of tonoclonic seizures but with an atypical spell characterized by confusion and incontinence, also with dyskinesias of the jaw.
MEDICATIONS: Nitroglycerin, Flovent, ASA, Protonix, Dilantin, Dilaudid, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake through stage II sleep record with photic simulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is within normal limits with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. In the transition to sleep, there are vertex waves, K complexes, spindles; and on 1 or 2 occasions, some frontal vertex waves which is a little higher amplitude on the left or right. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling into stage II sleep and produces scant driving.
HR: 70 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If further characterization of this patient's epilepsy is important, a more prolonged sleep recording, particularly looking for a frontal lobe focus, may be considered.
