MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
HISTORY:  A 21-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, 3 seizures in 2014, all clustering around an illness with fever.  Patient describes loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  As the patient transitions into stage 1 sleep, the EEG is somewhat disorganized, but POSTS and a handful vertex waves were noted.  In addition, in the transition to sleep, there are some subtle sharply contoured transients noted in the left mid temporal region.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, which produced some artifact, an increase in amplitude of the background and a well defined left anterior temporal spike with a generous field of spread.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving at essentially all flash frequencies.
Heart rate 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A left anterior temporal spike with rare subtle underlying sharp waves noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient demonstrates multiple normal variants including a vigorous supra harmonic driving and rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness.  The left temporal spike with the others subtle sharp waves however suggest a
localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  Comparison with previous studies may be of value.
