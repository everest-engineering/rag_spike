CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 1.  The patient states that she JUST STARES STRAIGHT ahead and has loss of consciousness.  Most recent seizure was 06/14/2015 while sitting with her daughter.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The patient seems to be quite drowsy and transitions frequently between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation is performed with a great deal of artifact, but does elicit a driving response.
At the close of the record, there is a single isolating delta wave from the right hemisphere.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG, in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This patient transitions frequently in and out of sleep.  This may be due to an underlying sleep deficit.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study may be obtained.
