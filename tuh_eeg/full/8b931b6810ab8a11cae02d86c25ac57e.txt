59 year old woman with a history of seizures.  PMH is notable for right MCA clipping
in 1988 with resultant skull defect in the right frontal/ central/ temporal region.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left consists of polymorphic 8-9 Hz activity with expected AP gradient and
excess theta activity.  The background over the right consists of polymorphic moderate to high
amplitude 7-9 Hz activity with poor AP gradient, excess polymorphic theta activity and brief bursts
of polymorphic delta activity.  Highest degree of right hemispheric polymorphic theta and delta
activity is found over the right frontotemporal/ central regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and continuous
focal right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right frontotemporal/ central
region. Diffuse slowing is etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the right.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A
single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.
