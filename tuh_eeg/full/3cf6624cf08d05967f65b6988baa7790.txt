History:	47 YO FEMALE P/W SOB AT 5PM ABOUT 1/2 HOUR LATER PT STARTED TO
HAVE MYOCLONIC JERKING AND SUDDENLY HAD A PEA ARREST X2, TOTAL
DOWN TIME 10 MINUTES.
PMHX: ASTHMA AND SZ
Medications:	PROPOFOL (20), PROTONIX, LOVENOX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 21 hours from 06/09/2015 to 06/10/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by bursts
suppression pattern with bursts that consist of diffuse disorganized delta and theta activity with
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some anterior predominant
sharply countoured delta can be seen. In between the bursts there are periods of diffuse background
attenuation lasting up to 4 seconds.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 126
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21 hours EEG because of burst suppression pattern and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction which may be due at least in part to medication effect.
