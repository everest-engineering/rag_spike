CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old woman with 2-4 complex partial seizures per month, usually complex partial with loss of consciousness, patient may run.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, zonisamide, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  The patient was noted to be asleep throughout much of the day and sleep during the night was relatively disrupted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with abundant lambda.  In wakefulness, there are intermittent asymmetries and occasional attenuation of faster frequency activity in the right or left temporal region.
In this 24-hour recording, there are exceptionally rare sharp waves noted, independently right or left anterior temporal, typically seen in drowsiness.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent, subtle attenuations in the right or left temporal region.
Exceptionally rare sharp waves noted at T2/F8 or T1.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring will continue in hopes of capturing this patient's seizures.
