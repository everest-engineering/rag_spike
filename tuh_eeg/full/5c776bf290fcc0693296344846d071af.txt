CLINICAL HISTORY:   51 year old woman with a pontine hemorrhage  in 2008, extensive ischemic white matter pathology, cognitive impairment and frequent falling. Evaluate for confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl, Vancomycin, Diphenhydramine, Heparin, Hydralazine, Lorazepam, Metoprolol, Insulin, Protonix
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was attempted and photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and an asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 hertz, 20 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm in a background intermittently disrupted by FIRDA or generalized  arrhythmic delta activity. Occasional shifting slowing is noted. Features of drowsiness include an increase
in background slowing. Rare left ventral sharp waves are noted during photic stimulation.
HR:  90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Intermittent background disorganization.
2. 	FIRDA.
3. 	Rare left central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The epileptiform features are discrete in nature. The background slowing could be do to this patient's ischemic cerebrovascular  disease or toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. The rare left central sharp waves may be due to this patient's previous CNS injury. Clinical review of the history is important to determine whether or not the patient has had a history of seizures and/or received seizure medication.
