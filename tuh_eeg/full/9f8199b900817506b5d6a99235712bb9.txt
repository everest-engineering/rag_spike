CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old male with previous right frontal hemorrhage and past history of seizures, currently seizure free.  The current problem is distal paresthesias left more than right, worse after drinking Mountain Dew.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which is present bilaterally.  The overall EEG is low voltage.  There is a small amount of subtle, underlying 3-4 Hz activity in the frontal regions.  It is present bilaterally, but is a bit more prominent on the right.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic central theta.  The overall drowsy pattern is nearly symmetric with the emergence of lower voltage vertex waves, in stage 1 sleep and brief vertex waves and spindles in stage 2 sleep.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  The patient was relatively drowsy and drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.

Heart rate 54 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:  subtle intermittent low voltage, frontal slowing, present bilaterally, but a bit more prominent on the right

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Focal slowing is less prominent This is the third EEG for this individual who has been seizure free for more than 1 year.
