INTRODUCTION:
This EEG was performed using a 10/20 electrode placement system and EKG electrodes capturing wakefulness and
stage I sleep and photic activation.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to a well formed 9 Hz background with amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts that is symmetric and reactive to
eye opening and eye closing. Frontocentral beta rhythm of 15 to 25 Hz and less than 10 microvolts amplitude is seen.
Stage I sleep is noted. Photic stimulation is normal.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG is normal. No focal or paroxysmal epileptiform abnormalities were seen. Please note that this EEG report is
different from the previous one. The transient abnormalities may represent changes seen after a recent seizure.
