REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 50-year-old man with epilepsy with a prior EEG in 2006 and recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen intermittently.
Seizures: None.
Heart rate: 102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent rhythmic anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
