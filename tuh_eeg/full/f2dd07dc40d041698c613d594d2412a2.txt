CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 18-year-old right handed adult with 4 tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Forty-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the alpha rhythm achieves a 9.5 hertz frequency.  In wakefulness, at times, the EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized, but at times a somewhat slower alpha rhythm, and a bit more disorganization as well as some shifting theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.
Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
The overall background demonstrates some subtle asymmetries.  POSTS are better developed on the left compared to the right.  Using frequency analysis, there appears to be a bit more slowing in the right posterior quadrant relevant to the left.
In hyperventilation, bursts of rhythmic slowing were noted with some shifting slowing, more prominent on the left.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 40-minute EEG is remarkable for:
Modest degree of background disorganization for an adult of this age.
Subtle asymmetries noted in this record with slower faster frequency activity on the right, relative to the left.
Somewhat asymmetric hyperventilation response with a bit more slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  These findings may be correlated with exam, history, and imaging.
