CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old female with end stage renal disease, CAD, hypertension, pericarditis, nephrectomy, leukemia, and chemotherapy with weakness and hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Acyclovir, Coreg, Heparin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded mainly in drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently in the left temporal at T3 and right temporal T4, as well as some C4 intermittent slowing.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bitemporal intermittent focal slow waves.
Some right central slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bitemporal and right central regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
