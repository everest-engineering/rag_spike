Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of beta activity and increased
amplitude over the left consistent with a breach.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase
reversal and amplitude maximum at F7.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontotemporal, With an associated breach.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the
left frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the same region.  This finding is indicative
of a focal structural lesion in this region and consistent with the known trauma and craniectomy.
