CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed woman with possible epilepsy. She had strange
smells and increasing headaches during her menstrual period.
MEDICATIONS: Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with continuous seizure and spike detection. There were multiple push buttons, but no clinical seizures, electrographic features, or clinical events noted by the team.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well developed 10Hz alpha rhythm of 50-60 mV. Lambda is noted in wakefulness. In stage II sleep there are vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The patient was to be sleep deprived, but she is asleep by 11:15 p.m. Much of the sleep recording is stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The nurse awakens her at 4:00 a.m. Push button times included 12:15, 15:56, 19:45, and 07:52. All of these were practice push buttons or patient requests for Tylenol.
HR: N/A
INTERVAL IMPRESSIONS/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal 24-hour video EEG.
LONG TERM MONITORING - 11-89 - 10/05/2011
CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old woman who BEGAN to have spells of recurrent syncope, lightheadedness, trembling and a funny smell. These are symptoms associated with headache.
A year ago, the spells were associated with prolonged recovery.
MEDICATIONS : Neurontin
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. Continuous seizure and spike detection is utilized. There are no clinical events and no electrographic seizures noted by the computer.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized. In
relaxed wakefulness, there is a 50 to 60 microvolt 10 Hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. The patient spends much of her time watching TV which generates abundant lambda. In practice, push button is performed at 19:52 where the patient describes in depth her typical seizures. Possible REM sleep is noted at 05:50 a.m.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal EEG.
LONG TERM MONITORING -11-89 -10/06/2011
CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed woman with syncope spells.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There are multiple push button events, but no
clinical seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. In stage II sleep there are abundant vertex waves, K-complexes. spindles, and POSTS.
Push button times: 13:09, 20:19, 22:43, 03:35, and 04:16.
The patient is awake during these events.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This 3-day long term video EEG monitoring sessions was remarkable: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. No seizures were recorded.
