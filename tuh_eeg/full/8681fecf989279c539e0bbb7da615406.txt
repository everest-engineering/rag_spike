REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with history of seizures since childhood, now transferred from Episcopal because of a seizure during a stress test and now having recurrent seizures of unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection, as well as seizure detection software, nurses events, patient's alarm events were all used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Patient events:  The patient had an event at 7:26 in the morning.  She pressed the alarm, laid in bed, and became unresponsive to any verbal or motor commands.  She continued to be unresponsive for about 3 minutes, after which the doctor came in and tested her.  She started crying and appeared to be slow to answer commands, but finally ended up answering commands.  She continued crying during this event.  During the entire event there was no abnormal EEG findings and remained as a normal awake EEG.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The patient's event in which she was unresponsive had no EEG correlate.  As such, it is consistent with the diagnosis of nonepileptic psychogenic event.
