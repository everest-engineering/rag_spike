History:	78 YR MAN WITH CC OF RIGHT MCA INF. AND FIRST SZ. HE FELL AND INJURED
HIS SHOULDER.  GTC-WITH POST ICTAL SOMNOLENCE.
PMHX DM TYPE 2 STROKE IN 3-14 RIGHT SIDE
Medications:	Norvasc, Insulin, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which is seen over best over
the left.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over the left frontal region.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There some loss of faster frequencies over this region.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 108
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region,
which is consistent with the known stroke.
