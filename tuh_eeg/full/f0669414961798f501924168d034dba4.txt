CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old male with history of syncope and loss of consciousness, history of hypertension, noncompliant with medications, and opiates at home.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Ambien, Norvasc, Nicotine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some myogenic muscle artifact in the temporal lobes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reveals a frequency of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing at T5/01 seen infrequently throughout the recording
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Infrequent left posterior temporal and occipital slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left occipital and posterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
