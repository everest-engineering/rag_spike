History:	59 year old male who presents with a TBI.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal/ with stimulation patient's background improves and consists of 8 Hz
polymorphic theta activity posteriorly with no discernable AP gradient and polymorphic delta
activity anteriorly.  There is more prominent EMG artifact over the left hemisphere.  Patient very
rapidly transitions into sleep.  Sleep consists of attenuated background with frequent diffuse sleep
spindle-like waveforms that are most prominent over bilareral frontocentral regions, left>right.
There appears to be paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.
A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up to 120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is a 20-minute abnormal EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing that appears to be
more pronounced over the right hemisphere. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild to moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is
suggestive of a focal structural lesion in the right hemisphere.  However, the degree of focal right
hemispheric slowing could be overestimated since there is more EMG artifact over the left
hemisphere.  No electrographic seizures are present.
