CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old right-handed male, with a history of childhood epilepsy, brain tumor in 2010, right thalamic abnormality in 2011, and nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  There was no mention of a craniotomy defect.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedance is under 5 kg with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is a small amount of underlying 6-7 Hz theta noted.  There are rare bursts of shifting asymmetry.  Overall amplitude is a relatively symmetric.  Stage 1 sleep includes vertex waves and POSTS, and vertex waves and spindles were seen in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited scant bilateral driving.  Photic stimulation seem to elicit a small degree of slowing.
Heart rate is 66 BPM and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due to,
Intermittent, excess theta.
Mild degree of background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no definitive focal features and there were no epileptiform features.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged tracing capturing sleep may be of use.
