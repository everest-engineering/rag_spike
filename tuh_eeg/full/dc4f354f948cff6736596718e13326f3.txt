History:	66 YR MALE WITH CAD S/P SENT, CHF, HTN, DM, GERD, CVA 1995, GOUT.  PT
HAD EPISODE OF YELLING THEN FOUND GTC. STARING. LASTING 20-40
SECONDS THEN 15 MIN POST ICTAL.  NEW ONSET.
Medications:	INSULIN, HEPARIN, HYDRALAZINE, NAPROXEN, PLAVIX, ASA, ZOCOR,
CARVEDILOL, ISOSORBIDE, PROTONIX, TORADOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in F7/T3 more than T3 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  At time it appears somewhat monomorphic and rhythmic consistent
with TIRDA.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
anterior and midtemporal region at time with a monomorphic appearance consistent with TIRDA.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region and TIRDA has a high
correlation with epileptogenic  activity arising from that region.
