CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed male with right frontoparietal mass, right hemispheric edema, midline shift and multiple episode with gastric symptoms.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is somewhat drowsy. There is arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant some of which is sharply contoured. There are also bursts of frontally predominant delta and in these bursts, there is a verification of left frontal temporal sharp wave. Vertex waves are identified in stage I sleep. Some of the vertex waves are to be left of the midline. In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing and disorganization.
2. Right posterior quadrant sharp waves.
3. FIRDA.
4. A few left frontal sharp waves.
5. Asymmetric vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's cerebral edema and shift may contribute to the pattern identified. If further information is needed, please consider a followup study after the patient has recovered from his craniotomy.
