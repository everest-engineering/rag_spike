CLINICAL HISTORY:  88 year old right handed woman with history of seizures primarily during sleep, now for preop evaluation for eye surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Clonidine, Zantac, Lisinopril
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8.5 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3, much more frequently at F8/T4.
There was slightly mild excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing, left more than right.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing, slightly more on the left in addition to mild generalized slowing, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  Please note that although some of these changes seen it the record may be due to age, these are slightly more prominent than usual.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
