HISTORY: 82 year old right handed male with large midline pineal tumor,
intermittent confusion, past history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Ciprofloxacin, Seroquel, Decadron, Protonix,
Cyclobenzaprine, Zocor, Lovenox, Finasteride, Cipro, Dexamethasone, Amantadine
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
The patient is awake, he speaks Russian only and is not so
cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a high
amplitude background with a 7.5 hertz alpha rhythm present bilaterally. There is a bit of
arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant. There is also some 45 hertz
theta frequency activity identified bilaterally. There are rare, subtle right parietal sharp
waves noted.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
4. Slowing in the right posterior quadrant with subtle right parietal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral
function. These subtle, right parietal sharp waves support a focal mechanism for
seizures.
