CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed gentleman who presents with episode with slurred speech, shaking in the left arm and loss of consciousness with a past medical history of COPD, asthma, CHF, DVT, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, Heparin, Lorazepam, Plavix, Insulin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  In 2008, an EEG was performed using 10-electrode placement system with electrodes and single EKG lead.  This record was done mainly with patient in sleep.  No activation.  No photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG opens with a slow and organized background with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity that disrupt the background.  The alpha rhythm is symmetric and is 10 Hz with a decreased amount of frontocentral beta.  In addition, there is mild slowing and mild photic response was ciliated.  The heart rate of this patient is 90.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild slowing frontal.
Intermittent rhythmic delta frontal.
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above EEG indicates diffuse dysfunction of brain function that could be seen in metabolic alterations.
