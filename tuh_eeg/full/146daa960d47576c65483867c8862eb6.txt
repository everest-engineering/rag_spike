CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old female with acute onset focal left sided and then generalized seizures for 20 minutes, 3 seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent. EEG Is recorded at 1:49 p.m. on the afternoon of 01/25/2010 and there is no indication as to the date of the patient's seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It is low voltage suppressed and very slow on the left. On the right, there are periodic sharp waves identified, maximum at T4 but with a generous field of spread including temporal and posterior temporal region with use of an average reference, they are maximum at T4 but her average reference does not include T2. There is variability in the morphology and the field of spread of the sharp waves. The periodic sharp waves and associated theta delta do not evolve. Stimulation does not significantly activate the record, although there is a bit more theta on the left. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Interhemispheric asymmetry.
3. Periodic sharp waves on the right. Maximum in the mid temporal region but with a generous field of spread.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded, but because of the prominence of the epileptiform activity, additional EEG recording may.be appropriate.
