CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old gentleman status-post right temporal lobe resection for a brain tumor with persistent lethargy.
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Lipitor, Phenytoin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There are no clinical notes regarding the purpose of this study, the patientâ€™s medications, or mental status. This EEG starts at 15:00 as described above and ends at 17:57.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somnolent.  The background EEG is continuous.  There is rhythmic theta frequency activity identified from both hemispheres, but there is a prominent breach rhythm on the right.  The patient is intermittently snoring or coughing, which obscures much of the study.  He occasionally shakes his head from side to side.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Primarily rhythmic background slowing with 4 Hz theta activity on the left, as well as some sharply contoured arrhythmic delta activity.
Suppression of the theta frequency activity on the right with more arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The background is similar to previous studies for this individual.
