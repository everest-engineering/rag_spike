CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with episodes of shaking, loss of consciousness, alterations in behavior. The patient received medications for these behaviors in January. The symptoms resolved.
MEDICATIONS: Clonazepam, Klor-Con, HCTZ, Lisinopril, Pravastatin, Indomethacin, Aug betamet
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. In the transition to drowsiness, there is occasional shifting left temporal theta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness include primarily slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Mild excess beta.
2. Occasional shifting theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The beta described above may be due to this patient's medications. The shifting theta is a nonspecific finding and may be correlated with the patient's clinical history and imaging. No epileptiform features were observed.
