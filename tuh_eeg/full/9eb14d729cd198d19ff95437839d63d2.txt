CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old woman with left MCA infarct and last previously evaluated in November for left gaze paresis and possible seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Keppra, ASA, Labetalol, Hydralazine, Lorazepam, Pantoprazole, Insulin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is an 8 hertz alpha rhythm with a smaller amount of 10 and 11 hertz activity. Shifting arrhythmic delta cavity is identified in the right or left temporal region. It is sharply contoured, but there is no definitive sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythm followed by vertex waves. Sleep is not sustained. Wicket activity is observed. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Heart rate is 50 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Arrhythmic background delta.
2. Shifting, sharp wave contour and slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features identified in either EEG. This study, however, does not include stage II sleep. This EEG supports a bihemispheric process compatible with a history of cerebral ischemia.
