EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage mainly theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some intermittent central alpha frequencies can be seen.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
