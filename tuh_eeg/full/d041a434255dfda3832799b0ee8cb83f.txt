History:	58 YO MALE PRESENTED TO ED WITH TROUBLE WALKING AND OPENING
DOORS. SZ (RIGHT ARM SHAKING) CC NOT BEING ABLE TO USE RIGHT ARM.
PMHX: VERTIGO, NEURO SARCOIDOSIS, SZ, HTN, HLD, DM, AND OSTEOPOROSIS
4/10/14 PT C/C OF  RIGHT OCULAR PERCEPTION PROBLEM.
Medications:	KEPPRA, INSULIN, LIPITOR.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
In maximal wakefulness, the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. However, the background is disrupted by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity.  .  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness and with hyperventilation.  Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is
present in the bifrontal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  1. FIRDA  2. Intermittent bursts of generalized slowing  3.
Intermittent bursts of focal left temporal slowing.  These findings are similar to previous studies and
demonstrate both generalized and focal features. This is the 5th EEG for this patient.  The
previously described left occipital sharp waves were not seen in this record.
