CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old left handed female with change in mental status. Patient has history of 2' large right MCA CVA with left weakness, HTN, DVT left leg, hypothyroid presents with seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Depakote,  Morphine, Warfarin, Norvasc, ASA, Synthroid, Zocor, Protonix, Senna,  Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somnolent, lying on her side and has difficulty cooperating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When she is cooperative underneath the muscle artifact the background is diffusely slow with a theta frequency background.  There is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity as she drifts off to sleep.  Other features as she drifts off to sleep include bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity as well as delta activity in the right centrotemporal region. 	Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background slowing and disorganization.
2.	Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
3.	Focal slowing a little bit more prominent on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Technically last month's EEG was significantly better.  The EEG continues to show background slowing and disorganization. These features are nonspecific and may be correlated with imaging. If ongoing seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing when she is able to cooperate is advised.
