CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old female with a history of hypertension, right parotid craniotomy with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma, hydrocephalus status post shunt, and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  None noted.
INTRODUCTION:  Long-term EEG of 8-1/2 hours was performed from 11/13/2011 to 11/14/2011 using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional single-lead EKG electrode and an anterior temporal electrode.  The patient was obtunded during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There are some state changes seen during the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges seen at C3/T3, at times with a more anterior, at times more posterior component with a low amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts occurring at 2 Hz, not clearly evolving.  Please note that these are of less high amplitude and more blunted than the previous recording.
Generalized slow waves.
No clear seizures are seen during the recording, and at times the muscle artifact appears to start and stop; however, we do not have video on this recording.  The previous electromyographic twitching seen in the other EEGs is not noted.
SEIZURES:  None (see above).
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left central parietal PLEDS.
Diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction or irritability in the left central parietal region, which is consistent with the known tumor in that region.  No clear seizures are seen during this recording.  Please note, this is an improvement from the prior records.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology, but in this patient it may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.
