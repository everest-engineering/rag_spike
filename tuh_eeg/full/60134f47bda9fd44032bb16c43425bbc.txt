LENGTH OF THE EEG:  25 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse, who now presents with left-sided tingling and a syncopal event.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, Lovenox, thiamine and Lipitor.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  A single EKG lead was placed as well.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 7.5 to 8 Hz theta activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no change in the background.  A regular heart rate is captured in a single electrocardiogram lead.
FINDINGS:
A slow posterior dominant rhythm.
No epileptiform discharges.
No sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal 25 minute awake only EEG due to mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.  This finding indicates mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  A regular cardiac rhythm is noted on the single electrocardiogram lead.
