History: 64 YR MALE  FOUND UNRESP ON STREET BROUGHT TO TUH.  PER DR. HAD LEFT GAZE DEVIATE  AND RIGHT UE POSTURING.  CT. FOUND RIGHT PARASAGITTAL ICH/ SDH.  PT HERE 1 WK AGO LEFT AMA HAD  FALL WITH FACIAL FX AND SM RIGHT FRONTAL BLEED
Medications:	VERSED DRIP., RECD ATIVAN, VERSED, FENTANYL,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes
Description: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Excess beta seen intermixed diffusely intermittently.  No normal sleep architecture was Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 126 with PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The excess beta may be due to medication
