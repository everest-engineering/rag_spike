AGE: 20 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 10/06/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG # : 15-1470
HISTORY:
20 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for possible localization related epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) 600 mg tablet, l.5mg tab PO Qam 1 tab po Qpm and l.5tab qhs
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 1,000 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times daily.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a Nicone system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
l. Frequent left temporal spike/polyspike and wave discharges (F7/T3 maximum, often including Fpl/F3). During hyperventilation these discharges distribute diffusely but have a lead-in on the left.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with fair cooperation and produces focal slowing in the left temporal region. Also see above under "epileptiform activity."
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:
Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing
Frequent left temporal spike/polyspike and wave discharges (F7/T3 maximum, often including Fpl/F3) . During hyperventilation these discharges distribute diffusely but have a lead-in on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are suggestive of left temporal epileptogenic discharges superimposed on left temporal cerebral dysfunction.
