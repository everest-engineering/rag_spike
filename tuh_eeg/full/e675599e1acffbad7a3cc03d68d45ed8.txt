History:	33 Y/O MALE R HANDED. PT STATES HE WAS OUT DRINKING BEER AND DID A
SHOUT OF FIREBALL AND THEN WENT OUTSIDE WHERE HE FAINTED. NO
Medications:	LEXAPRO
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region independently during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Heart rate was 66.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG because of rare focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
