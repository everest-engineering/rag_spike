REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old man with a history of hypertension, stroke, left parietal hemorrhage, melena and who presents to the hospital after a change in mental status. Wife stated that she gave him some Xanax and trazodone at night and the patient became confused.
MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, doxepin, Keppra, famotidine, Serax, cyanocobalamin.
INTRODUCTION:  A route EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the entire recording there is movement artifact as the patient was agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere and slightly over the left.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient did not go into sleep.  There is excessive beta throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently over the left hemisphere, maximum the anterior temporal region at F7/T3 and a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  There appears to be a slight attenuation decrease in the amplitude of the frequencies over that hemisphere.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left hemispheric focal slowing, maximum in the anterior temporal region as well as slight symmetry of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction over the left hemisphere, maximum over the anterior temporal region, which is not specific with in regards to etiology, but may be due in part to the previously known hemorrhage.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.  Please note again that this is a limited EEG due to the patient's continuous movement artifact.
