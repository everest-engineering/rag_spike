CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 42-year-old male, admitted on July 14th after anoxic insult with tox screen positive for opioids and cocaine.  Persistently comatose.
MEDICINES:  Norepinephrine, Unasyn no sedative, hypnotic medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory record.  There was muscle artifact noted in the beginning of the record and a neuromuscular blocking agent was utilized later in the record. Temperature 101-103
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The interpretable record includes a markedly low voltage, suppressed pattern.  There was, however, scant, isolated,  low voltage cerebral activity.  There was no reactivity or variability
Heart rate:  125  bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG, 48 hours post cardiac arrest demonstrates ominous prognostic features:
The cerebral activity is markedly suppressed,  and was not reactive or variable.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Ongoing neurological assessment was appropriate over the next 24 to 48 hours.
