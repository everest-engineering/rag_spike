CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old right handed male with history of febrile convulsions at age 3.  The patient developed recurrent seizure while drinking water, had epigastric rising and then eyes rolling back in head with loss of consciousness and left arm and leg shaking for one minute.  A second seizure occurred 5 minutes later.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall EEG is well organized. Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record producing some hypersynchronous bilateral theta, some of which was notched.
As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, prominent rhythmic mid temporal theta is noted, first on the right, but then on the left. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Hyperventilation did not produce definitive spike and wave activity, but did produce paroxysmal slowing.  The patient has prominent, mid temporal theta of drowsiness.  To more fully evaluate this patient's epileptiform potential, a repeat tracing with stage II sleep and hyperventilation can be scheduled as an outpatient.
