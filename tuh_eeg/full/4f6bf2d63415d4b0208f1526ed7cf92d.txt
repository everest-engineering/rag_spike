CLINICAL HISTORY:	44 year old woman with a history of an aneurysm in 2008,
stroke, and seizures, now with 3-5 headaches per week.


MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol,  Motrin, Gabapentin, Hydrocodone, Prilosec, Senna, Ferrous-Sulfate,  Avian, Ventolin HFA,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was initiated and photic simulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9Hz,  40 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm with generous low voltage frontal central beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness, there is some subtle arrhythmic delta activity in the left mid? temporal region. Features of drowsiness included the focal slowing described above followed by posts and vertex waves.  Posts are slightly higher amplitude on the left. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving responses bilaterally. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation.	Following photic stimulation, more extended stage II sleep is noted.

HR:  N/A


IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Occasional to infrequent left temporal focal slowing which on one occasion is sharply contoured.
2.  The left temporal features appear primarily in drowsiness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  C/W focal process on the left.
