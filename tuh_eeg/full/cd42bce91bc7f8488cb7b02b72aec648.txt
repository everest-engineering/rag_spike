CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old man with seizures for 5 years described as generalized tonic/clonic shaking and tongue biting and an aura of lightheadedness.  Last seizure was 4 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
Heart rate 84.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently in the occipital regions at 01 and 02 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  At times this appeared to move more toward the parietal regions.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently also at T3 and independently at T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing in the occipital region as well as in the bilateral mid-temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the occipital region as well as the bilateral mid-temporal region, which may be related to the known trauma.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
