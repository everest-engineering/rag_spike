History:	42 year old woman with seizures.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity.  The
background is mildly disorganized with unstable AP gradient.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves.
A single large amplitude right anterior temporal spike with aftergoing slow wave is captured.
Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F8/T2 electrodes.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, single, right temporal, anterior
No stage 2 sleep
Disorganization, mild
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 20-minute EEG because of mild background
disorganization and a single right anterior temporal epileptiform discharge.  The former is an
indication of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  There is potentially epileptogenic focal structural
lesion in the right anterior temporal region.  A repeat study with sleep may be of further benefit.
