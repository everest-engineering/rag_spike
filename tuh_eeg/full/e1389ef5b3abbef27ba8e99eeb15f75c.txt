CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 83-year-old with acute myocardial infarct, stent placement, now with confusion and left-sided weakness,
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, fentanyl, Ativan, and aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG for an adult patient, who is somewhat restless, drowsy with frequent orofacial movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient transitions from awake to drowsy state.  In this overall, low voltage record, there are intermittent asymmetries with intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are some bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and again, the asymmetry is a bit more remarkable with drop out of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere.  On rare occasions, there is blunted, sharply contoured slowing noted in the right central temporal region.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Subtle focal features, which include disruption of faster frequency activity on the right hemisphere.
Rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the right central temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this older adult with a history of cerebrovascular disease, these findings support a structural or functional process on the right.  The findings are intermittent.  No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up tracing may be of value.  The generalized background slowing may be a toxic, metabolic or postictal phenomenon.  This also supports the value of a follow-up study.
