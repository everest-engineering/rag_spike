History:	49 Y/O RH woman. Age 13 at  FIRST SZ. PT WAS BORN WITH AVM, CAUSING

HAS BEEN SZ. free,  AURA SHAKING R HAND, LOC R EYE DEVIATION . CBZ
Medications:	TEGRETOL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral anterior temporal
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing seen
independently in the bilateral anterior temporal regions. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction in these regions, which is etiologically non-specific.
