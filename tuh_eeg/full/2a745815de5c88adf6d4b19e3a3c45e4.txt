CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old male with cranioplasty, victim of traumatic brain injury, multiple seizures, multiple evaluations for seizures, admitted with shaking of face, arms, legs for 2-3 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lamictal, amantadine, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The background EEG is slow.  It is difficult to tell if the patient is awake or not.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow with a relatively slow featureless delta pattern in the temporal regions.  The EEG is richer in beta frequency activity in the frontal central regions.  Shifting slowing is noted with a craniotomy and some sharply contoured slow delta in the left frontal temporal region.  There patient seems to have spontaneous arousal with an increase in alpha frequency activity, although the patient does not seem to be doing very much when that pattern is identified.
Heart:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due:
Marked background slowing.
Slow, featureless delta pattern in the temporal regions.
Some sharply contoured slowing in the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function and it appeared that the patient's craniotomy may play a role with a sharply contoured slowing on the left.
