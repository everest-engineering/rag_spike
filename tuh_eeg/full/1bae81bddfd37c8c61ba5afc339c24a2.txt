REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69-year-old man with aortic valve disorder with an episode of unresponsiveness, about 4 episodes last week with eyes rolled back, stared blankly, no history of epilepsy, has a past medical history of CAD, MI, hypertension, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Xanax, Flomax, amiodarone, and famotidine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz and appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen in the limited wakefulness.  There are some stage changes but no typical sleep architecture is seen.  There were no activating procedures performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During the limited wakefulness there is diffuse slowing at 5-7 Hz seen in short periods throughout the recording.  The majority of the rest of the recording is in sleep which reveals diffuse slowing at 2-4 Hz.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing in limited wakefulness.
HEART RATE:
It appears to have a wide complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
