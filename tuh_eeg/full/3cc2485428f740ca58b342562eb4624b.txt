Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep is captured.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional brief bursts of frontally-maximal spike-and-slow-wave
discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of 3 Hz. These appear to have an asymmetric onset,
however it appears to be maximal mainly on the right.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of bifrontal asynchronous spike-and-wave. This finding
is consistent with epilepsy. The discharges may represent a fragment of a generalized epilepsy or
alternatively may represent a focal epilepsy with rapid bilateral synchrony. In addition there is
intermittent focal slowing in the right central region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
