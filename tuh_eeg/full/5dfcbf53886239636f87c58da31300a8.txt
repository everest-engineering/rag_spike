CLINICAL HISTORY:  32 year old right handed woman coming in with new-onset seizure and diagnosed with a right brain tumor for 3 years.  The patient has had a seizure during sleep, tonic-clonic, lasting for 1-2 minutes with no recall of events.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and II of sleep.
Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens with well-defined posterior dominant rhythm 9-12 Hz bilaterally which is reactive to eye opening.  There was a shifting and slowing throughout the EKG pattern more on the right than the left.
There is excessive amount of beta waves on the central leads on the right indicative of a breach  rhythm on that side.  The patient appears to go into stage I and II of sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Shifting and slowing more on the right side than the left.
Breach rhythm on the right side.
Occasional C4 sharp waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Shifting and slowing on the right side more than the left.
Breach rhythm on the right side.
Intermittent C4 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to shifting and slowing more on the right than the left with a breach rhythm indicating focal structural brain lesion consistent with a right-sided brain tumor.  Occasional C4 sharp waves could indicate epileptiform potential
