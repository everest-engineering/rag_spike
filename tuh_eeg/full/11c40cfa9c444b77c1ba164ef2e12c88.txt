CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed woman with blackout spells since February 2011, last episode March 20, 2011. Diabetes. Hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Folate Acid, Insulin, lisinopril, Simvastatin, Thiamine, Furosemide, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10-Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In drowsiness. there is an increase in background 8 Hz activity. In drowsiness. there is occasional arrhythmic delta, left more so than the right. particularly centrotemporal and frontotemporal. Other features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and K complexes and POSTS. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Greater than acceptable, left greater than right temporal theta and delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are nonspecific findings in a subject of this age and are more commonly seen in the context of underlying ischemic cerebrovascular disease or silent ischemic pathology although this is a nonspecific finding. There are no epileptiform features.
