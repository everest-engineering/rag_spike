History:	36 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SZS X3 MONTHS.  PT VAGUE ON HOW MANY.
STATED PRIMARY SAID SECONDARY TO TRAMADOL STOPPED 2 MONTHS
AGO AND CONTINUES TO HAVE SZS. GTC/TONGUE BITE WITH NO POST
Medications:	SEROQUEL, CITALOPRAM, ALPRAZOLAM, BUSPIRONE, TRAZODONE,
ALBUTEROL PRN, METHIMAZOLE, PERCOCET
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Beta diffuse, Normal EEG
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
