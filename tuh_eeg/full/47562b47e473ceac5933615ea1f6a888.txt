CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old male with right-sided weakness and slurred speech.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin and aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically adequate study.  Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The abnormalities include an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The left hemisphere is higher amplitude and the right hemisphere is lower voltage and more suppressed.  There are bursts of rhythmic, generalized delta.  In addition, there are bursts of more focal delta, maximum in the left frontal region.  Some of the left frontal delta somewhat sharply contoured.  An intermittent alpha rhythm of 7 hertz emerges.
The patient is somewhat confused, but answers questions with some detail, although some of the details are incorrect.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in bursts of rhythmic delta.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG identifies multiple abnormalities including:
Bursts of frontal delta.
An amplitude asymmetry with a lower voltage, somewhat slower record on the right.
Left frontocentral higher amplitude, rhythmic delta, which is at times sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric process.  There may be multiple contributors including a toxic or metabolic component, and/or bihemispheric structural components.  Correlation with imaging and clinical examination is suggested.
