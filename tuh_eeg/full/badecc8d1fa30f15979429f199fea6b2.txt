History:	62 y/o female with pmhx ESRD, dvt/pg, cva, pna, thyroid disorder. pt presents to
hospital   having a seizure in bathroom this am. 2x today.
Medications:	Dilantin, 2MG Ativan IM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by disorganized
diffuse high amplitude delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies. There are some overriding beta frequencies discharges seen
intermittently in  the frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bifrontal region during wakefulness.
Occasional focal sharp waves are present in the bifrontal region, with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at F4/F3.  At times there appears to be a mild buildup in the frequency of the focal
slowing and sharp waves, specially with stimulation.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 110
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral frontal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges and focal slowing in the
bilateral frontal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
