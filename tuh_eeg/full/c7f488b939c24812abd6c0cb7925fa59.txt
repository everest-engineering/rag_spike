CLINICAL 52 year old left handed male admitted with status epilepticus
characterized by a single 20-25 minute tonic clonic seizure with loss of consciousness on the
251h.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is Intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the overall EEG is low voltage,
relatively is depressed with scant beta and delta. There are some sharply contoured triangular
shaped waves noted in the frontal regions. As the recording continues, there is an increase in beta and theta frequency activity in the background and a discrete sharp wave in the left frontal
region is noted. Stimulation of the patient is performed later on in the record and the patient is starting to have a low voltage more continuous theta delta pattern.
HR: 96 bpm and irregular
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background after initially a very suppressed background.
2. Transition to a mixed frequency background.
3. A suggestion of left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is one of many EEGs for an individual with recurrent status
epilepticus. The pattern described above is his usual postictal slow and depressed pattern
although it does improve. This is the first EEG that I identified discrete left frontal sharp waves
and small spikes. The postictal pattern of a background suppression is a finding previously
identified for this individual. Additional EEG recording when he is out of the ICU may be of use
if further characterization of his epileptiform focus is needed.
