CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with position of the T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  The patient was provided with an event button.  Nursing notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.  Spike detector and seizure detector were activated.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old man with recent onset of episodes characterized by lightheadedness followed by loss of consciousness and occasional urinary incontinence.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra off, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, nicotine gum and Percocet as needed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hertz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep symmetrical sleep spindles, vertex waves, K-complexes, slow wave sleep and REM sleep are captured.
The patient had an episode of induction with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The induction produced no events.  There were no events captured in 24 hours.
FINDINGS:  No typical event occurrence.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal continuous audio video 24 hour EEG monitoring.  There were no typical events.  The induction procedure produced no events.
