History:	64 YR MALE WITH PRESENTS WITH SZS.  PMHX: ICH LEFT, SZS, HEP C., DVT.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eye
opening and can only be seen over the right hemisphere.  A 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over the right frontal and central regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the frontal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an associated loss of faster
frequencies over this region.  Very frequent  focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F3, F7 and rarely Fp1.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left frontal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, Maximal frontal and with
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the
left frontal region along with continuous focal slowing.  These findings are indicative of a
potentially epileptogenic focus and a structural lesion in this region .  No clinical or electrographic
seizures are present.
