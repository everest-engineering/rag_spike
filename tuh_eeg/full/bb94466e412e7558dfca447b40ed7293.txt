CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There was no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a low amplitude polymorphic diffuse delta activity with frequent periods of discontinuity.  With stimulation, periods of discontinuity briefly shorten and delta activity increases in frequency.  Intermittently, ventilator artifact is captured. No electrographic seizures observed.  A single EKG lead demonstrated the heart rate of approximately 100 to 120 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
Severe diffuse slowing.
Discontinuous background.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal comatose 22 minute electroencephalogram due to severe diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is nonspecific in etiology, but in this patient could partially be related to the sequela of anoxic brain injury.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
