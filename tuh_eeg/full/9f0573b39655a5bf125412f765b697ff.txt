CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman found confused and staring.  Last found normal on February 14.  Tox screen positive for barbiturates.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Serax, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab, using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was described as very drowsy and hyperventilation could not be completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In brief wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly transitions to a drowsy pattern with generous alpha and beta frequency activity.  Occasional posts were noted.  Wicket activity was also noted.
In the transition to sleep, there are rare bursts of shifting slowing.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep in stage II sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult at this age, due to:
Excess beta.
Rare shifting and slowing.
No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The shifting and slowing is a nonspecific finding which can be seen in cerebrovascular disease or other causes in an adult of this age.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be of value when the patient recovers from the benzodiazepine overdose.
