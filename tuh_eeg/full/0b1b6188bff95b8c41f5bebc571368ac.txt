CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old woman with 1 hour seizure on May 4th.  No loss of consciousness, evaluated in the emergency room for right arm and leg shaking.  Family history of epilepsy and frontotemporal tumors.
MEDICATIONS:  Losartan, Naprosyn, 175 mg sertraline, Benadryl, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory record with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes, particularly  the T2 electrode.  The patient was noted to be somewhat anxious.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage background with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Muscle twitch artifact is noted throughout the EEG, particularly from the right scalp electrodes.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Technically somewhat challenging but essentially normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This individual continued to have a fair amount of muscle twitch artifact and restlessness, which may be evaluated clinically.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing, with perhaps more extensive sleep may be helpful in more completely characterizing epileptiform activity.
