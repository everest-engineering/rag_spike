CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed woman with a history of epilepsy at age
18, now with recurrent episodes where she slightly loses track of time. She forgets her
train of thought. She is not noted to have abnormal behavior but just a loss of time.
Some of these spells are associated with blurring of vision.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Simvastatin, Singulair, Omeprazole. Ranitidine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is a n awake and drowsy record in an individual who
rapidly drifts off into sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.
Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta. Eye movement artifact is
noted in wakefulness and drowsiness. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of
theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at intermediate frequencies.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important
consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. This
patient seemed to be somewhat drowsy, but this is not an unanticipated finding for an
otherwise individual who might be somewhat tired.
