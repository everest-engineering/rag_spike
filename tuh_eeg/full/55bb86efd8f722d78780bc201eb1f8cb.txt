CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Isoflurane, Fentanyl, Epinephrine, Midazolam, Rocuronium, Lidocaine, Phenylephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The CEA montage was unitized. Recording begins at 8:05, concludes at 11 :04. This is a 3-hour EEG
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins the patient has already received anesthesia. The background EEG is rich mixed frequency pattern with theta and delta activity. There is a slight asymmetry following the utilization of anesthesia with a bit more delta on the left. Occasional shifting slowing is noted, as is occasional generalized attenuation compatible with an anesthetic effect.
The carotid is clamped at 9:34. In the minutes prior to this the EEG is suddenly discontinuous. No significant changes are noted following placement of the damp, although the baseline asymmetry and discontinuity persists.
Recording continues throughout the unclamping of the carotid and confirmation of the patency of the carotid by Doppler. Unclamping of the external carotid at 10:32. The EEG is intermittently discontinuous, but there are no changes. The internal and common carotid are reclamped at 10:32 and 10:33 respectively. The EEG is discontinuous and in fact there is a note that the patient's propofol is increased due to a need to manage blood pressure immediately at that time.

HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for intermittent discontinuity, which increased with adjustment of the propofol dose, as well as a somewhat asymmetric background.
