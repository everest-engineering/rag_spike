CLINICAL HISTORY:  18 year old right handed female with ADHD and overflow incontinence, presents with change in mental status, was in usual state of health until 4 days ago when started complaining of headaches, diagnosed with ADHD and started on Adderall on Sunday, cannot remember anything 01/23.  Per friend, had seizure-like activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Potassium.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Possible seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in quiet while lethargic.  Sleep stage 1 and stage 2 were recorded and activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is lack of normal frontocentral beta.  Sleep architecture for stage 1 and stage 2 is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz in addition to FIRDA were seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
