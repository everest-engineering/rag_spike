REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old man with a history of left-sided numbness and weakness and shaking and falling down stairs.  History of diabetes, hypertension, and neuropathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Altace, Ativan, and Oxycontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background, which appears to have diffuse beta and mainly in sleep.  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm, but this may be obscured by the diffuse beta.  Overall, the patient easily drowses off and is in limited wakefulness.  During hyperventilation, there appears to be some bursts of rhythmic bifrontal slowing.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient reaches stage I and stage II sleep.  Please note that at times there is also rhythmic bursts of theta, which are anterior maximal, which are most consistent with drowsiness, however, some of them have a slightly suspicious appearance.
SEIZURES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
HEART RATE:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  The excessive beta seen may be due at least in part to medication effect.  Please note that even though no clear posterior dominant rhythm could be seen, this may be due to the excessive beta, and in addition, the rhythmic anterior theta is likely due to drowsiness, however, if clinical suspicion for epilepsy remains, a more prolonged EEG may be helpful in elucidating or clarifying the diagnosis.
