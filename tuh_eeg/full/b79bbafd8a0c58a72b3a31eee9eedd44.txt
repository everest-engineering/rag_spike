CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old male with cardiac disease, multiple embolic strokes, recent EEG 1 month ago for same complaint.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.2 Hz symmetric, reactive posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal-central beta activity.  Intermittent, arrhythmic delta activity was noted in the left midtemporal region, some of which is sharply contoured with phase reversal at T1.  Drowsiness seems to accentuate the focal slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving, but is also recorded in drowsiness, which seems to again accentuate the focal slowing.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent focal slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing with 2 sharp waves from the left midtemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a previous study 1 month ago.  The focal slowing is not as prominent. This may be part of the natural history of improvement post sub acute stroke.
