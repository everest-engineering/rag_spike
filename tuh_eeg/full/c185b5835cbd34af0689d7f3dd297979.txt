CLINICAL HISTORY: year old male with combative behavior, evaluate for subclinical
seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10ÃŸ
20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There are no clinical notes provided.
Seizure and spike detections software was not employed. This is a 6-hour and 28 minute
record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD The background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage slower
pattern. Despite EKG artifact, there are temporal sharp waves which can be differentiated from
the EKG artifact on the right The record includes wakefulness through stage II sleep. Despite
the focal slowing at times, somewhat frequent sharp waves in the right temporal region, there
are no seizures recorded. The sharp activity on the right is accompanied by some rhythmic
theta which maybe part of this patient's underlying background. There is, however, some
rhythmic alpha theta frequency activity which persists into well delineated sleep stages,
suggesting that activity may also be epileptiform.
HR: 120 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Focal slowing in the right mid posterior temporal region.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL Although no seizures were recorded, this EEG supports a focal
mechanism for seizures.
