History:	65 YO FEMALE W/ PREVIOUS HISTORY OF SEIZURES. EEG REQUESTED FOR
LEFT LEG AND ARM TWITCHING.
PMH: LEFT SDH S/P CRANIOTOMY, RIGHT SUBDURAL HYGROMA
Medications:	keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
Background activity is predominantly irregular, theta and delta activity, with absence of the normal
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There is intrahemispheric asymmetry in both
amplitude and frequency, with higher amplitudes and slower frequencies seen over the left
hemisphere.  No definite state changes were present.
Frequent frontally predominant triphasics waves were seen, with a higher amplitude over the left
hemisphere.  Frequent and at times nearly continuous, focal spike-and-wave discharges a are
present in the left frontal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, abundant, left frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (L>R)
Triphasic waves, frequent, bilateral
Breach artifact, frequent, left
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal EEG due to frequent epileptiform discharges in the left frontal region.  These
findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition,  there were
frequent, frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing.  These findings
are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive
of a metabolic origin.  The breach artifact correlates with the patient's history of a left-sided
