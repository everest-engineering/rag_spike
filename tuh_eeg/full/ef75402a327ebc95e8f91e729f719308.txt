CLINICAL HISTORY:  74 year old male with new onset seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Insulin, Dexamethasone, Zocor, Protonix, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, there is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.  There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Underneath the muscle, there appears to be some intermittent slowing on the left as well as a bit of shifting slowing.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and then attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Posts are noted in stage I sleep, as are vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  The occasional left temporal bursts are a bit more prominent in photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm and at times irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Occasional rhythmic slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The focal slowing may be correlated with history and imaging.
