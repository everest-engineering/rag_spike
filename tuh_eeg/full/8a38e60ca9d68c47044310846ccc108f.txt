CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 23-year-old man with a history of seizure onset in 2005.  Episodes are described as loss of consciousness, generalized convulsions, incontinence of bladder, and postictal confusion.  This is a followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Dilantin and Kapseal.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the background voltages attenuate.  Hyperventilation is performed with a good effort, and produces several bursts of 4 to 4.5 Hz frontally predominant generalized spike and wave discharges as well as polyspike and wave discharges.  This activity starts approximately 1 second into hyperventilation.  The longest run is approximately 3.5 seconds.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Several rounds of frontally predominant generalized spike and wave discharges as well as polyspike and wave discharges at 4 to 4.5 Hz.  The longest run is approximately 3.5 seconds.  This activity is observed only during hyperventilation.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to several bursts of frontally predominant generalized spike and wave discharges and polyspike and wave discharges.  In the proper clinical context, this activity is suggestive of generalized mechanism of onset of epilepsy.
