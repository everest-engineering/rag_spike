CLINICAL HISTORY: 77year old woman status post code on October 31st with
transient myoclonus, now intubated and unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS
Depakote.
INTRODUCTION
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10.20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated and
unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD
The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It is
mixed-frequency, Low-voltage pattern on the right with a mixture of delta and theta.
From the left, there is an irregular left anterior temporal sharp wave with focal slowing.
The sharp wave can occur with bursts of irregular sharp waves and/or focal slowing.
Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 120 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves.
2. Marked background slowing.
3. A pattern which is more suppressed on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION
The sharp waves support a local mechanism or a focal
mechanism for seizures. The overall background slowing and lack of reactivity are poor
prognostic features.
