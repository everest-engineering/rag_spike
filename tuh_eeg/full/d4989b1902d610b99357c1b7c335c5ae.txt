CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old man with epilepsy since 2005 with refractory recurrent seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zonisamide, and Tegretol

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures were not performed. Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses notes along with patient's alarm events were used to review the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta. Activating procedures were not performed. The patient does go into stage I and stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T1 at time independently at T3 and rarely at F8/T4. The morphology of the left temporal sharp waves at times is small and spiky with a field that appears to involve F3 electrode. All the spikes that are seen are mainly in sleep.

SEIZURES:  None.

EVENTS:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal and mid temporal spikes.
2. Occasional right mid anterior temporal spikes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Clinical correlation will be left for the end of the recording. This is day 2 of long-term recording.
