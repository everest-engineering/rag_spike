CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old male, admitted  on March 2014 with right subdural hematoma, no interval history of seizures or other problems.

MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc and clonidine.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms.  Electrode pop was noted at CZ.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small degree of shifting asymmetry noted in both hemispheres, particularly in the posterior regions.  Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.

Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate 60 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Shifting slowing, particularly in the posterior regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous EEG, this EEG is markedly improved.  No epileptiform features were noted in either EEGs.  Of note, this patient is not listed as receiving antiseizure medications at this time.  Please let us know if this is an incorrect assumption.
