CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed woman with renal failure, hypertension, asthma, left MCA infarct, and HIV disease with encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Aldomet, Bactrim, Zosyn, Metoprolol, Furosemide, Protonix, Methyldopa, Epivir, Viread, singulair, Celexa, micardis, fluticasone, ambien, Albuterol, Nortriptyline, Kaletra, Prednisone, Bactrim, Hydralazine, Calcitriol, Oxycodone, Advair, Heparin, Azithromycin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient appears quite unwell.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a high amplitude overall pattern. There is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of posterior head-rocking. There is a small amount of shifting arrhythmic delta activity noted in wakefulness. Features of drowsiness including anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings would be most supportive of underlying white matter pathology. The overall cortical pattern is quite preserved. The high amplitude of background is a nonspecific finding. It could be a normal variant or related to the metabolic abnormalities.
