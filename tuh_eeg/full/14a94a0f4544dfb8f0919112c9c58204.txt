CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 50-year-old woman with dizzy spells.  Episodes with loss of consciousness, and heaviness lasting 5 minutes.  Treated with gabapentin.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  Room #533.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a disorganized and somewhat dynamic pattern.  Some portions of the record are better organized and others with a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but other sections have a bit more arrhythmic delta activity.  Both eye blink artifact, and rhythmic frontal slowing were noted intermittently and there was also some shifting slowing.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta in the background.
Photic stimulation produces an alerting response, as well as a driving response.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due.
Background slowing and disorganization.
Intermittent paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic theta or delta.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  Additional evaluation looking for an underlying cause may be of use.
