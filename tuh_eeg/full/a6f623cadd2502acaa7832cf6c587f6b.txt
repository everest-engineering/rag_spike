CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed woman with seizures attributed to tramadol.
MEDICATIONS:  Cellcept, Prograf, Prednisone, Valcyte, Famotidine, Metoprolol, Oxycodone, Bactrim, Gabapentin, Valium
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was attempted using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was cheerful when the EEG started.  She complained that her scalp was burning and red with placement of the electrodes and terminated the EEG within minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The limited EEG provided includes generous muscle artifact, excess beta, excess theta and a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation was attempted.  The patient was crying during the EEG and the test was terminated after 9 minutes.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a technically unsatisfactory EEG because it did not accomplish 20 minutes of good recording data.  The symptoms that the patient experienced were unusual and will be investigated to determine if the electrode paste could have contributed to the symptoms she experienced during the test.
