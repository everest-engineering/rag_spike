REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 39-year-old woman with episodes of bilateral arm stiffening, head may move to the right for 20 minutes.  Has had 4 to 5 seizures in the past month.  Moves her arms and feet.  No legs.  Screaming.  History of MR and lateral gaze.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, topiramate, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with MR episode of stiffening of bilateral arms, head gaze to the right, lasting 20 minutes.  Has had 4 to 5 seizures in the past month. Follow-up EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the entire EEG, there is severe diffuse movement artifact which impedes clear view of the EEG and makes it difficult to make any clear definitive conclusion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record appears to be diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm and no frontocentral beta.  Overall, there appears to be a theta delta mix, slow background.  In between the continuous muscle artifact, there appears to be multifocal spikes, some at C4, some at O1 or O2, some at Fp1.  However, more spikes could be there, but the limited recording makes it difficult to be seen.
No clear seizures were seen.
The heart rate was 96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to multifocal spike and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of or symptomatic generalized epilepsy, with multiple focuses of irritability.  No clear seizures were seen on this limited recording, while the patient is shaking her right arm.  Concerns for seizures persist, sedation and/or paralytic may be helpful in being able to capture an optimal EEG.  No clear seizures could be ruled out, as there is too much artifact in this recording.
