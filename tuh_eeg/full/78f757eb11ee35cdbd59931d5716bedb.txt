Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The waking background is well-organized, with a 25-40uV, 8 Hz symmetric alpha rhythm which
attenuates on eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity noted during wakefulness.
Symmetric beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There are occasional
bursts of frontally predominant delta activity lasting 2-3 seconds.  During drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 65 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slow posterior dominant
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.
