CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old male with a previous left-sided cranial plate, epilepsy either since childhood or for the past year, family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lipitor, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine, 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall EEG is relatively low voltage with background theta.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm, which is 5 Hz and is a little bit more prominent on the left compared to the right.  Frontal central beta was noted and intermittent asymmetry was noted in relaxed wakefulness, with at times a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz noted on the right, not so vigorous on the left.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving, a bit more prominent on the right.
Hyperventilation was not successfully completed.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This routine outpatient 20-minute EEG is remarkable for:
Degree of generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry with at times an alpha rhythm on the right, which is 10 Hz and an on the left, considerably slower in the theta range.
The generalized background slowing described above supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The alpha asymmetry is ipsilateral to the previous cranial surgery.  Correlation with imaging is advised.  No epileptiform features were noted today.  No previous EEGs were available at this time for comparison.  If appropriate, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be valuable.
