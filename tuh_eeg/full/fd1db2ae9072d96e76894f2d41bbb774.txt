History:	19 year old woman who has an abnormal MRI brain but no history of prior seizures.
Medications:	N/A
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Frequent polymorphic theta activity is captured over the left anterior temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  HR was 72.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, mild, left temporal, anterior
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to frequent mild left anterior temporal focal
slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
