CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old female with a history of seizures prior to her previous stroke.  She has no seizures reported recently.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient is currently on topiramate, diazepam, Percocet, Lidoderm, Neurontin, trazodone, Remeron, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  This is a technically satisfactory 20-minute EEG with impedances under 5 kilo ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7 hertz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The overall background is somewhat slow.  Head rocking is noted in the posterior regions.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
The heart rate was 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  For this patient with a history of right hemiparesis, there was no significant focal slowing.  No previous EKGs are available for comparison.  The background slowing support diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, which can be seen in the context of dementia with the use of multiple sedative-hypnotic medications.
