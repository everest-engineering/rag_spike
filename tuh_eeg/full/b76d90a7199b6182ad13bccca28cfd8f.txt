CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman with stroke, syncope for which the patient was amnestic as well. Evaluate for possible tonic clonic seizures. Past history of lung cancer and asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Lantus, Flexeril, Glucophage.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 hertz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is scant, shifting
theta or delta noted in early drowsiness. There is also a small amount of rhythmic frontal
slowing. Wicket is observed in the transition to sleep and over lies the temporal shifting
slowing particularly that is seen on the right. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits no driving response.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Shifting temporal slowing, left greater than right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no definitive sharp waves noted in this EEG.
There is wicket and some arrhythmic slowing in the temporal regions. Because of this,
sharp waves may be under recognized. If epilepsy is an important consideration, then
repeat sleep is suggested capturing sleep is suggested.
