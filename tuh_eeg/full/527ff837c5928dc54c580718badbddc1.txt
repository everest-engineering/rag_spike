History:	65 YO WOMAN WITH CC OF SZ IN ER HAD SZ RIGHT FACIAL TWITCH, THEN
GTC.  PMHX:  SZ, DM, CVA LEFT BG BLEED, CAD, HTN.  PT ON O2
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a posterior dominant rhythm with an amplitude of 25-40uV,
and a frequency that at best reached 8Hz.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV,
6-7Hz activity.  Patient was drowsy at times.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere, maximal in the
midtemporal region during wakefulness  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the
right midtemporal region during wakefulness  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR -72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal mid-temporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere, maximal in the mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region. In addition, there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right mid-temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
Lastly, there is mild  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
