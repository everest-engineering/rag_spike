AGE: 57 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/29/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma study EEG #: 15-1425
HISTORY:
57 y.o. Female who is s/p cardiac surgery and presenting with change in pupil exam and hypotension. Head CT showed subarachnoid hemorrhage. She is referred for EEG for altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS: ASA, famotidine
No current facility-administered medications for this visit. SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is suppressed. Variability and reactivity are absent. There are no spontaneous eye movements.
Profound generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no change in the background activity to noxious stimuli.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:
Suppressed background
Absent variability and reactivity
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate profound cerebral dysfunction.
