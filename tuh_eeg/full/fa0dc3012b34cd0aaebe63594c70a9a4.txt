:
History:	44 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH SINGLE SEIZURE IN 2007. PT PUT ON KEPPRA,
HAD A BREAKTHROUGH SZ JUNE 30TH AND WAS TAKEN TO WITH ED WITH
POST ICTAL CONFUSION.55 CM HEAD
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 10Hz alpha rhythm. However the amplitude of the PDR is
decreased slightly on the left. On a referential montage the difference is minimal.  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During a short lasting stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
There is an asymmetry of the response with a lower voltage on the left that is only seen on a
bipolar but not referential montage.  Hr. was 78
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The PDR voltage asymmetry noted above is
likely artifactual and related to lead placement.
