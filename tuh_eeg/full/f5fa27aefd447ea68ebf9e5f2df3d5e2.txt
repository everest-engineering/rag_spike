INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed. The patient is extremely somnolent. The patient is essentially asleep
throughout the entire record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a slow pattern with
features of stage II sleep including spindles. There is some subtle slowing in the right
central temporal region with a bit more delta. Stimulation of the patient barely produces
an arousal and, in fact, the patient has her blood drawn during the EEG and remains
essentially stage I and stage II sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow background with prominent beta activity.
2. Subtle focal slowing in the right central temporal region.
CLINICAL This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. There are features of normal stage II sleep noted. Â·
