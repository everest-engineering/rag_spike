CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old right-handed woman with nocturnal seizures which began at age 18, patient was seizure free and medications were stopped, but 8 months later the patient's epilepsy recurred with 3 tonic-clonic seizures out of sleep, all with tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were identified.  Hyperventilation produced bilateral theta including some paroxysmal bursts of theta, but no definitive spike-and-wave activity.  Drowsiness was characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram is wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and either comparison with previous EEGs or a repeat study capturing sleep is suggestive.
