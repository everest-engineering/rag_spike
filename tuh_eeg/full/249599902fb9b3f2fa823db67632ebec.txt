History:	49 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NOTED ON 2/28 WITH EPISODE OF
EYES ROLLED BACK, POSSIBLE LOC- REPORTS SEVERAL "PASSING OUT"
EPISODES IN PAST. PMHX SIG FOR HIV ON HAART, COPD, ASTHMA, HTN,
STROKE, POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE.
Medications:	LOVENOX, PROTONIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Shortly after reaching stage II
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 120
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent, mild
Excessive or inappropriate sleep patterns
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild excessive theta in
wakefulness.  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  In addition the patient appears to have a short sleep and REM latency, which might
indicate a presence of sleep disorder. If clinically indicated a sleep study may be beneficial.
