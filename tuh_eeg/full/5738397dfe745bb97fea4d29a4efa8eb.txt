History:	68 year old woman status post PEA arrest twice, now comatose with intermittent
episodes of facial grimacing and bilateral arm decerebrate posturing.
Medications:	Versed on and off throughout the recording
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR, AP gradient and normal sleep architecture.  For the majority of the recording the
background is severely attenuated with periodic diffuse monomorphic bursts of brief (~0.5 sec) slow
delta activity that has triphasic appears.  These bursts occur every ~2.5 seconds and do not appear
to be affected  by patient stimulation.  At the end of the recording, there is increase in diffuse
muscle artifact and appears of more continuous diffuse polymorphic delta activity.  It is not known if
versed drip is stopped at the end of the recording.
No events of grimacing and posturing are captured during the recording epoch.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked
Attenuation, marked
Event, not recorded
Interpretation:
This is a very ABNORMAL nearly 4 hours continuous video EEG due to marked background slowing
and attenuation. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Bursts of periodic activity that are seen throughout the majority of the recording could
be artifactual given their highly periodic nature  No events of grimacing and posturing are captured
during the recording epoch.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team at the time of the
