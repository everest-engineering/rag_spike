History:

74 YO FEMALE BROUGHT IN FOR CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS. PT WAS HAVING TROUBLE VERBALIZING . PMHX: STROKE + LEFT CEA 8 YRS AGO. Bl- PASS 4 YRS AGO, DM, HTN.
PRESENTS WITH ABOVE  HX ALONG WITH SUDDEN UNRESPONSIVENESS , SOB. EEG TO RIO SZ.
Medications:	NICARDIPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.   Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies .
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording. These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse Triphasic waves, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate diffuse background slowing. These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a meta origin.
