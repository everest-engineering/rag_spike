CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male, admitted with acute unresponsiveness.  Past history of right frontal encephalomalacia.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox and thiamine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In the drowsy state, there are intermittent bursts of shifting irregular delta noted from either hemisphere, somewhat more prominent in the left frontal region than the right.  There is a slight accentuation of beta in the right frontal regions.
Sleep is characterized by an increase in beta followed by vertex waves, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate 68 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
shifting slowing, more prominent in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features noted.  The findings described above may be correlated with imaging.  This report was provided to the clinical team early on the 13th to facilitate discharge.
