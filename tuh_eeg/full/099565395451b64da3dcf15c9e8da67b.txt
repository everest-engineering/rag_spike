REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old man with a right MCA stroke and left hemiparesis, hypertension, presents with altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Zofran, moxifloxacin, metoprolol, amlodipine, ibuprofen.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen continuously at T4 throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right midtemporal region, which is consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
