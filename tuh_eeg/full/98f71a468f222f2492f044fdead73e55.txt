History:	61 year old woman with a history of seizures and left hemispheric strokes, who
presents with several typical seizures.
Medications:	Topamax, Keppra, Ativan, phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The background over the right hemisphere consists of 9-10 Hz alpha activity with preserved AP
gradient.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen over the left and PDR
is also absent on the left.  The background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic
moderate amplitude, at times sharply contoured, continuous theta and delta activity.  Occasionally,
rhythmic delta activity is noted over the left, especially over the posterior quadrant.  No normal
sleep architecture is present despite presence of clinical sleep.
Intermittent left midtemporal/ centroparietal sharp waves with after going slow waves are captured.
They have somewhat variable polarity and maximal scalp negativity occurs over T3, T5, C3, P3
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
Sharp waves, intermittent, left, midtemporal/ parietocentral region, variable polarity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 27-minute portable EEG due to continuous moderate left hemispheric
slowing and intermittent left midtemporal/ parietocentral epileptiform discharges. These findings
are indicative focal left hemispheric structural lesion that is potentially epileptogenic.  These
findings were conveyed to the primary team and patient was placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
