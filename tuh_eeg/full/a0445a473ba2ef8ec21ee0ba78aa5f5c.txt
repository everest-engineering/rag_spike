CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed man with a past medical history of seizures in infancy.  His last seizure was yesterday, was generalized tonic-clonic, loss of consciousness and tongue biting.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Finasteride, Gabapentin, Levothyroxine, Albuterol, Advair, Simvastatin, Fluoxetine.

REASON FOR STUDY:   Seizures

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:   None

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG has a 9 to 10 Hz alpha rhythm, 20 microvolt amplitude.  The posterior concomitant rhythm is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Minimal drowsiness was seen as it does not go to both sleep stages.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed and did not elicit any epileptiform discharges.

HR:    84 bpm

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:    None

SEIZURES:    None

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform discharges were identified.  A normal EEG does not preclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Seizures are an important consideration.  Ordering a sleep-deprived EEG may be considered.
