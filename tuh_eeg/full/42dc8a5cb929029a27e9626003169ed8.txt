CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old male status post cardiac exacerbation of illness requiring intubation and sedation, now extubated, but encephalopathic. He has a past history of stroke and dementia.

MEDICATIONS: Aricept, Insulin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background EEG is low voltage and quite slow. It is somewhat more attenuated on the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in lower voltage theta activity.

HR: 104 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Marked background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The marked background slowing in a patient who is arousable and can provide a few words is more compatible with an underlying chronic disturbance of cerebral dysfunction. No epileptiform features were identified.
