CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old male with 8-year history of epilepsy. Describes tonic-colonic seizures with incontinence, tongue biting, and respiratory arrest.  Seizures in July and November 2014.  Patient reports sensations throughout his body on the day before his seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record with impedances under 5 kilohms for most electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, 80 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Patient appears to have been sleep deprived and rapidly transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation:  The patient was in stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.  Despite this, a driving response was noted at 15 hertz.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This was the 3rd normal EEG for this adult.  It did capture extensive stage 2 sleep.  If this individual continues to have frequent seizures, alternative techniques to capture epileptiform activity or a seizure may be considered.
