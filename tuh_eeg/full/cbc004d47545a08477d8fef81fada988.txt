CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old woman found unresponsive with possible anoxic injury, bipolar disease, previous overdose, and suicidal attempt.  The patient is now being evaluated for anoxic insult, treated with Narcan.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lovenox, Azithromycin, Unasyn, Atorvastatin, Famotidine, Tylenol, ASA

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall pattern is an abnormal, suppressed pattern with intermittent bursts of high amplitude paroxysmal sharp waves, reaching amplitudes of 120 microvolts with a well-defined after-going slow wave.  These begin anteriorly on some occasions and posteriorly.  They are higher amplitude posteriorly but seem to start anteriorly.  The discharges are sometimes more exclusively anteriorly and occasionally more exclusively posteriorly.  They occur approximately 1 per second to 1 per 3 seconds.  There is no specific evolution for these but on some occasions there is some lower voltage 3 Hz activity that follows.  Stimulation of the patient does not impact the pattern.

HR:    104 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. The appearance of a post-anoxic pattern with a burst suppression pattern with high amplitude paroxysmal discharges.
2. To some extent, some features compatible with a PLEDs plus like syndrome.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These are extremely worrisome findings for an individual following anoxic insult.  These findings may be tempered by the duration of time.  In the acute phase, however, these are very worrisome features.
