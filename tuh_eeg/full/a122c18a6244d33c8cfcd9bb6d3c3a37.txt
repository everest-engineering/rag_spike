STROKE WORKUP EVALUATE FOR SZ. HX HEROIN ABUSE ASA METHADONE
Medications:	No AED, METHADONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm that reached at best 8Hz was seen.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Occasional diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are
present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region
independently.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Triphasic waves, occasional
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm in
addition to frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing.
These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific,
but suggestive of a metabolic origin.There is also  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal region independently.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
