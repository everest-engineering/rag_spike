History:	45 year old man with a history of craniotomy in 2000.  patient had 2 lifetime
seizures: in 200 and 2001.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic very sharply countoured theta and delta activity is present in the left mid-
temporal region.  Underriding fast activity is noted over the same region.  Several moderate-to-high
amplitude spikes with aftergoing slow waves are noted over the left anterior temporal region.
Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F7/T1/T3 electrodes.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal, mid
Breach artifact, left temporal, mid
Spikes, few, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 27 minute EEG due to continuous moderate focal left
midtemporal slowing and several left anterior temporal epileptiform discharges. Continuous focal
slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and is consistent with known history of
a prior craniotomy.  There is a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right anterior
region.  Breach artifact is a sign of a skull defect.
