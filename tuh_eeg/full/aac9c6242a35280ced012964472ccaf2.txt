CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old woman with epilepsy for the past 25 years, complex
partial seizures. The patient is seizure-free at this time.

MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively
low voltage with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is a small amount of wicket activity noted
particularly at T1. There is also a l it11e bit of focal slowing noted in the left mid to anterior temporal region initially in hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits driving. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.

HR: 58 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits

CLINICAL CORRELATION: An adult of this age is permitted a little bit of temporal
slowing. In this case, it is seen only on the left and with the wicket there Is no definitive epileptiform activity. Of note, however, previous EEGs did identify left temporal sharp waves.
