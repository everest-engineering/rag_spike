CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 71-year-old with past stroke, change in mental status, right MCA infarct, generalized shaking, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, metronidazole, Lovenox, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.   The patient is sedated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is markedly abnormal.  Features include bilateral background slowing with superimposed focal slowing on the right with disruption of faster frequency activity.  In addition, there are poorly formed sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere, sometimes seen at C3, T3, or left frontal region.
Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
The characteristics of sleep include, as the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta.  In sleep, somewhat asymmetric triphasic waves were noted.  In addition, vertex waves were also observed.
Heart rate:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Diffuse bilateral slowing.
Periodic sharp waves seen intermittently from the left.
Rare triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports an epileptiform focus on the left, which is contralateral to the area with the greatest ischemia.  These findings were reported to the clinical team.
