CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old gentleman with traumatic brain injury in May of 2012, hit on the head by the garage door, no loss of consciousness, but the patient subsequently felt panicky and wild.  Since the injury, he has had excessive movements in all extremities, intermittent body swelling and an extremely sensitive cranium, particularly on the left.
MEDICATIONS:  Valium, Flexeril and OxyContin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is prominent, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount low voltage frontocentral beta.  Likely, mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movement and an increase in beta.  Occasional rhythmic midtemporal theta was noted as the patient became drowsy.  POSTS were noted in sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous driving response with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The vigorous driving response described above is a normal finding.
ADDENDUM:  At the end of the EEG, after the tech had completed the study and turned off the video EEG machine, the patient had an episode of involuntary movements of the extremities without impairment of awareness.  Unfortunately, this was not captured.
