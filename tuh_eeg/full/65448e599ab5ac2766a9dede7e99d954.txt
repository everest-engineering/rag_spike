CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old woman with a syncopal spell with generalized shaking for 2-5 minutes and postictal confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Alphagan, Metformin, Lisinopril, Levetiracetam, ASA, Omeprazole

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record. The record beings with the patient in sleep state with background slowing and bursts of delta. The patient is awakened for photic stimulation. Even when she is awake, the background demonstrated rhythmic slowing with a 6-7 hertz posterior dominant rhythm and bursts of medium amplitude and generalized delta.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
3. FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. This may represent bihemispheric disease, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or even postictal state. No epileptiform features were observed.
