CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old male with seizures characterized by loss of consciousness and shaking without tongue biting or incontinence, seizure free for the last 3 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 22-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.
The patient is quite drowsy, transitions in and out of sleep with slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Other features of sleep include POSTs followed by brief arousals.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Hyperventilation served to alert the patient.
Heart rate 60-70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted, but a single, normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a followup record capturing more sustained sleep, deeper stages of sleep, or even a sleep deprived record may be of value.  Of note, however the patient was quite drowsy, he just did not achieve deeper stages of sleep.
