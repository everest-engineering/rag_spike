CLINICAL HISTORY:  Evaluate for overdose.  A 20-year-old male found with multiple empty bottles of Seroquel, trazodone,  hydroxyzine. The patient had an episode on presentation with lip smacking and clonic activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is generally a technically acceptable record with impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The vast majority of the EEG demonstrates stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and brief arousals from sleep.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study after the patient's sedative hypnotic medications have worn off may be considered.
