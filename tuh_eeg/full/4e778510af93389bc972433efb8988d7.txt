History:	74 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. SITTING AND TALKING WITH NIECE AND
DAUGHTER AND HAD EPISODE OF LOC+ AURA VERY LIGHTHEADED, AND THE
EYES ROLLING INCONT. AND RIGHT LEG TWISTED PER DAUGHTER AND
NIECE. PMHX. NO H/O SZ. DM TYPE 2. 56 CM HEAD.SYNCOPE VS SEIZURE??
Medications:	LISPRO, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Some Temporal intermittent delta activity (TIRDA) is
seen.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 90 and PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, anterior
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, left
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing and
epileptiform discharges in the left anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a
potentially epileptogenic area of focal cerebral dysfunction in the region.
