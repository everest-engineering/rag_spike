DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Additional EEG recording is performed as the patient received IV Depakote.  Following the infusion of the IV Depakote, the patient continues to have a diffusely slowly and somewhat discontinuous pattern with brief bursts of fast activity.  Occasional muscle twitch is noted, but it seen sporadically, not in association with the bursts of fast activity.
EKG:  N/A.
IMPRESSION:  This extended video EEG was remarkable for:  A post anoxic pattern which was somewhat discontinuous with bursts of fast activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform seizures were seen.  These findings are worrisome following anoxic insult.
