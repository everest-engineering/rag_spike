CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, migraines, presented with complaints of migraines, dizziness, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Dizziness, Migraines, Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation, and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at T3 with an atypical field that moves towards P3 with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Focal slow waves seen at P3 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal sharp waves seen in the left mid temporal region with a field that moves to the left parietal region.
Some mild left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the left mid temporal region, which has a high correlation with seizures arising from the region.  No seizures were seen.
