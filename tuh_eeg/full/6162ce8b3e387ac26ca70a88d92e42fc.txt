CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 65-year-old woman with past neurological history including cerebrovascular disease, right cranial shunt, seizures, none recent but recurrent falling or gait disturbances versus syncope.  Symptoms of dizziness, sweating, and falling.  Shunt noted on the left this year.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute study with photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This study captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which is relatively symmetric.  At times, it is a bit more disrupted in the right hemisphere.  Shifting slowing was noted from the 2 hemispheres, a bit more prominent in the temporal regions.  There is a bit more underlying arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of the alpha rhythm in the right posterior quadrant.  Features of stage 2 sleep include spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing, more prominent on the right.
At times disrupted alpha rhythm, this time more prominent on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a 2nd EEG for this adult without epileptiform features.  The shifting slowing was previously identified in the record last year, but with a bit more prominent on the left.
