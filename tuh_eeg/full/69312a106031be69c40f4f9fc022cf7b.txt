CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old woman with right brain lesion, confusion, and seizure.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Versed, Etomidate, Labetalol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is significant movement artifact in the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates continuous,
mixed frequency pattern rich in alpha, beta, and theta frequency activity. Despite the significant muscle artifact, there is occasional focal 2-4 Hz activity in the right hemisphere, particularly central temporal and posterior regions. The overall record includes generous fast activity and muscle artifact.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal pattern with mixed frequency background rich in beta and theta frequency activity.
2. Despite the limitations as described above, occasional focal slowing on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified, but the
artifact described above may preclude such. A repeat study when the patient is extubated may be of value.
