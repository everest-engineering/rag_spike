AGE: 63 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1398
HISTORY:
63 y.o. male with a history of seizures, reportedly more frequent beginning the first week of September 2015. PMH: Seizures, CAD with CABG 2007, COPD, HTN, CKD, PAD
stent RLE, MRSA.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, Neurontin, Flexeril, Flomax, Insulin, Zestril, Catapres, Lopressor, Plavix, Imdur, Norvasc, Symbicort
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing and occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and asleep routine EEG due to:
l. Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing
2. Occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of bitemporal (left > right) cerebral dysfunction.
