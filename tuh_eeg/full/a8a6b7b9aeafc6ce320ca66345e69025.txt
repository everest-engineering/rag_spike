HISTORY:
A 23-year-old male with unknown handedness previously treated in Puerto Rico for a tumor requiring shunt, now with headaches and seizures, status post shunt revision on July 11, 2011.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, Dilaudid, Topamax, morphine, others.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. This is an acute postoperative patient, who complained of significant scalp discomfort.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG is somewhat challenging with muscle movement artifact. There is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm identified. There is no information regarding the side of the craniotomy, but there is a bit more higher amplitude in the left frontotemporal region in comparison to the right. The right seems to be a little bit lower voltage and attenuated.
Features of drowsiness including increasing delta. There are occasional bursts of paroxysmal slowing observed bilaterally. Rare vertex waves and POSTS are seen, but those are observed followed by arousals.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. In apparent wakefulness, some degree of background slowing.
2. An asymmetry between the left than the right with the lower voltage and a bit more suppressed pattern on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No epileptiform features were observed. This is a technically somewhat challenging EEG. The asymmetry noted may have been impacted by the impedance issues. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study when the patient is more comfortable is suggested.
