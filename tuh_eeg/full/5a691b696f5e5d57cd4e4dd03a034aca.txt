CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old female with refractory epilepsy, infantile spasms,
multiple seizures per day.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Klonopin, Depakote, Flonase, Zyrtec, Clonazepam, Valproic
acid, Protonix, Guaifenesin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
It is not possible to complete hyperventilation. The patient is sitting up in her wheelchair.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and
lacks normal developmental milestones for an adult It is primarily a delta with beta
background, relatively symmetric. There are spike and slow waves and slow spike and
slow wave complexes identified throughout the record typically posteriorly predominant,
a bit more remarkable on the right than the left. At least on one occasion, there was a
suggestion of build up of discharges. Stimulation of the patient does not seem to alter
the record. The patient has coughing and other voluntary movements without EEG
correlate. Photic stimulation does not alter the record.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent effect nearly continuous slow spike and slow wave activity which is
more prominent in the occipital regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This child's previous EEGs were not available for
comparison. This EEG supports a secondarily generalized mechanism for epilepsy and a hi-hemispheric CNS disturbance.
