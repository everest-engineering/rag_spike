CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old left handed woman with Xanax withdrawal followed by seizure on February 19, 2012 when she felt flush, lightheaded, laid down, and had a tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Paxil, Remeron, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 70 mV.  Features of drowsiness include slowing of the alpha rhythm with hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.  POSTS are noted in stage I sleep, as are rare vertex waves. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
