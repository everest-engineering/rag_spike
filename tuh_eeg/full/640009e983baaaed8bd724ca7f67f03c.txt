CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old male with cerebral pathology, possible metastatic cancer with right arm shaking without loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Decadron, insulin, heparin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient was somewhat confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates prominent asymmetry.  The left hemisphere is somewhat disorganized with a medium amplitude mixture of beta and theta and a glimpse of 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more of a pattern of rhythmic mixed theta delta in the right hemisphere.  Some of this is sharply contoured.  Phase reversal at T2/T4 was noted.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not well defined.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Photic stimulation also served to alert the patient briefly and on rare occasions, a bilateral posterior dominant rhythm could be identified following photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
Rhythmic slowing in the right hemisphere.
Right hemispheric sharp waves, maximum right mid temporal.
Bilateral background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process, which is more significant on the right in comparison to the left, although the clinical report was right arm shaking, sharp waves were noted on the right.
