CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old with migraine headaches characterized by blurry vision, slurred speech, nausea, sensitivity to pain and left frontotemporal headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 10.5 alpha rhythm and a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  Lambda was noted in wakefulness.  As the patient became drowsy, attenuation of alpha rhythm was noted with more of a theta pattern and POSTS.  The patient transitions in and out of deeper stages of sleep with small epochs of stage II sleep followed by arousal.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Lambda waves are a normal finding.  This patient seemed to have somewhat fragmented sleep which may be related to underlying physical discomfort or an inability to get comfortable in the lab.
