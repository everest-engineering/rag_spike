CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed woman, 5-months' pregnant, who has developed seizures 2 weeks ago characterized by shaking lasting seconds.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  The first stages of sleep were not achieved.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous, bilateral driving.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
