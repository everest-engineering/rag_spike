CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old female with history of sarcoidosis, lung transplant now with head movements, history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, vulvar cancer, and now events of eye bobbing, tongue biting.  EEG to rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Gen-Acyclovir, Mycophenolate, Pantoprazole, Zofran, Midazolam, Heparin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive. Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen throughout the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
The background of the EEG is consistent with anterior predominant symmetric 1-2 Hz anterior predominant triphasic waves seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times, the patient is stimulated and there is diffuse muscle artifact and a slight increase in the frequencies.
At times there are some frontally sharply contoured wave forms but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing, anterior triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The triphasic waves suggest that the encephalopathy is at least partly due to a metabolic derangement such as hepatic or liver disease.  No seizures were seen.
