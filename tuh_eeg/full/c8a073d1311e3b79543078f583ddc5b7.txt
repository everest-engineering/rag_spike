CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, last seizure August 2009.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this EEG. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. This is the 3rd EEG without epileptiform activity.
