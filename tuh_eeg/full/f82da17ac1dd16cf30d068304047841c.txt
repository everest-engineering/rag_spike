CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old right handed woman with schizophrenia, manic depression.
MEDICATIONS: Ability.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and an asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 8 hertz. There is some shifting slowing. The overall record is somewhat disorganized. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing some sharply contoured slowing. Head rocking artifact is noted. Features of drowsiness include an increase in synchronicity of the background and the record at the end of the study was a bit more rhythmic. Photic stimulation is remarkable for driving response at 15 hertz. There is a burst of rhythmic activity in the right
posterior-temporal region of 5 hertz and which may represent a normal variant of
rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness. HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing .
2.  Disorganization.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific and may reflect the patient's current medications  or medications she received in the past month. There are no definitive epileptiform activities although there is a normal variant of rhythmic mid temporal theta on the right.
