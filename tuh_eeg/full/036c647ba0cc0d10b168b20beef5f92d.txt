CLINICAL HISTORY: 90 year old right handed woman with subdural hematoma, bilateral frontal encephalomalacia in October. Now with persistently declining mental status and sundowning despite reduction in Keppra.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Levetiracetam, Metoprolol, Amlodipine, Levothyroxine, Evista, Pradaxa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is completed. This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who could not cooperate with testing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm present bilaterally. The most prominent features in this record are arrhythmic delta activity, particularly in the left frontocentral and temporal region. A breech rhythm in that same region and occasional sharp waves at F3 or T3. There was also some more subtle, bilateral frontal rhythmic delta. The focal slowing from the left central and temporal region is fairly continuous. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. In drowsiness, the focal slowing becomes more continuous.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left frontocentral and frontotemporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves identified from F3 and T3.
3. Mild bifrontal slowing.
CLINICAL COURSE: Similar features have been identified but the overall background is significantly improved. The focal epileptiform activity is in the region of the patient's previous neurosurgery.
