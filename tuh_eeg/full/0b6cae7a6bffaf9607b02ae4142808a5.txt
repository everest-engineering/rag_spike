CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right handed gentleman with episodic nausea,
increasing headaches, but no blackout spells or seizures, treated with Topamax. Past
history of ocular injury 2 years ago.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. Eye artifacts are somewhat asymmetric.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.
Frequent eye blink artifact is noted. There are bursts of shifting slowing in the temporal
regions. There is significant EKG artifact in the right temporal electrode. Features of
drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Hyperventilation produces a
small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving. At the close of the
record, there is rare focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional irregular slowing in the temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. In this individual
with a past history of cranial trauma, if epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up
study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. Given the shifting slowing
described above, correlation with imaging may be appropriate.
