MOANING WITH INCONT.AND BOTH BOWL AND URINARY. SZ. STARED IN 3-20`5
STATED BY HIS AUNT. PMHX HTN, NEW ONSET SZ.
Medications:	HEPARIN,INSULIN,ASPIRIN,PROTONIX,KEPPRA,LORAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Focal slowing is normal for age.
