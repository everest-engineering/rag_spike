CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed man with a history cocaine use with multiple seizures now confused.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Multiple seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with interior and anterior single lead EKG electrode.  He patient was recorded mainly in sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals no abnormal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded mainly in what appears to be sleep, but the background is not typical for normal sleep architecture.  It consists of mainly diffuse slowing in a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  There is intermixed bursts of 12-15 Hz beta in a spindle-like appearance throughout the recording.  These bursts may last up to 1 to 5 seconds. No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  There is intermittent bursts of spindles and frequency discharges seen mainly in the frontocentral region throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which did not specifically etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the spindle bursts seen throughout the recording may be seen in the setting of a medication effect.
