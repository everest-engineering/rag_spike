DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This patient appears to be quite drowsy and much of the EEG includes stage II sleep wake with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. In maximal wakefulness the EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz, 40 mV alpha rhythm. There are some electrode artifacts.

HR:    96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
