HISTORY: A 58-year-old woman with hypertension, asthma, and head injury January 2013. Residual right-sided numbness. headaches, and double vision. The patient admitted to the hospital with dizziness, worsening right sided weakness, chest pain, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Toradol, Benadryl, Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION: digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred. Photic stimulation was completed, this Is a technically, acceptable. routine EEG of greater than 20 minutes duration. Impedances were
Acceptable aside from the T1Â·T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Is somewhat slow and disorganized. The alpha rhythm is typically 8.5Hz, occasionally increasing to 9Hz. There is intermittent. relatively rhythmic background slowing. As the patient becomes drowsy, the posterior dominant rhythm demonstrates anterior spread.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Occasional bursts of more irregular slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific but can be seen in a toxic metabolic encephalopathy. In this individual with a history of stroke, no focal or epileptiform features were identified. If epilepsy Is an Important consideration, a follow up study may be considered.
