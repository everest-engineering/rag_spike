History:	67 year old female with history of stroke and episodic facial twitching, now resolved
for follow up EEG.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is intermittent focal slowing noted over the left hemisphere, fronto-temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a modest, symmetric photic
driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent left frontotemporal focal
slowing. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Focal slowing
may indicate a structural brain lesion.
