DAYS AGO , WHEN HE STOPPED WALKING. ACCORDING TO AID HE HAS DONE
THIS BEFORE WHEN SEEKING ATTENTION. THIS AM PT. REFUSED TO EAT
SHAKING.
Medications:	INSULIN, HEPARIN, DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  Awake only.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 84  Technical difficulties: Poor
quality record due to high impedance and continuous movement artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited awake EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
