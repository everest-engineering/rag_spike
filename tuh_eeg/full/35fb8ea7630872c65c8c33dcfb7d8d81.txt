CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman admitted to the hospital on the 18th.  The patient had developed right-sided weakness and was nonverbal with fever, history of cardiac valve replacement, found to have left subinsular stroke and endocarditis.

MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, gentamicin, cefepime.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent but when stimulated there was a great deal of muscle in the background.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background is diffusely slow, poorly organized with primarily delta and smaller amounts of theta.  The patient grimaces which produces a fair amount of muscle artifact. In this challenging EEG, there are some posteriorly predominant periodic sharp waves more on the left than the right and rare, broadly contoured left central sharp waves.  Toward the close of the record, there is a small train of the sharp waves in the left central region as well as 1 or 2 in the right central parietal region.  Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact.

Heart rate 120 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Occasional posteriorly predominant periodic complexes left greater than right.
3. Left central sharp waves.
4. Occasional right central sharp waves as well.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as might be anticipated with this critically ill patient.  The sharp waves on the left are in the region of this patient's acute stroke.  The sharp waves on the right may reflect previous CNS injury which should be evaluated in the context of a syndrome of septic emboli.
