History:	Pt with continuous jerking, ESRD and pneumonia.
Medications:	Heparin, Ativan
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a high amplitude disorganized pattern that briefly improves
with a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 8.5Hz for seconds.  Intermittent bursts of diffuse rhythmic
delta are present, predominately in the bilateral centroparietal regions.  Continuous diffuse tremor
artifact is present, without a clear evolving pattern.  This is an awake only record.
No focal slowing is present.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present in this technically limited
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 132.  Technical limitations:
Nearly continuous tremor artifact is present throughout the recording, limiting evaluation of
underlying focal or epileptiform features.  Near the end of the record, the patient received 1mg
Ativan, which allowed better evaluation of the background.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization, continuous, moderate diffuse
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, bilateral, predominately centroparietal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of diffuse disorganized, background slowing, and slow
alpha rhythm. This indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may be due to toxic, metabolic or
anoxic encephalopathy.  The tremor artifact without an EEG correlate is suggestive of subcortical
