CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old right handed woman with seizures. Her last seizure
was reported on September 9, 2010, status post fall down the stairs. Evaluate for
change in mental status, status eye deviation, and transient language disturbance.
MEDICATION: Lovenox, Pantoprazole, Zofran, Morphine, Hydralazine, Narcan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
The EEG is recorded at 8:43 in the morning, shortly after the patient's confusional
episode with eye deviation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates primarily a 7
Hz theta pattern. The patient is awake with eye movements, or slightly drowsy with
slowing rolling eye movements. There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing. The
overall amplitude is medium to low.
HR: 78 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A pattern of primarily rhythmic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although the patient seems to be poorly responsive, the EEG clearly demonstrates an awake and/or drowsy pattern.  This slow pattern is similar to this patient's 3 previous EEG's.  Although, at least a year ago, she carried a diagnosis of epilepsy, none of the EEG's have identified epileptiform features.
