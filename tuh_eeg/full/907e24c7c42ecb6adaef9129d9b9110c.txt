History:	59 YR. OLD MALE R HANDED.GENERALIZED WEAKNESS GREATER ON R SIDE.
PTS STATES HE HAS LOST 20 LBS. IN LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
Medications:	Versed drip, Keppra.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by marked
diffuse very low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 108.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Attenuation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing, attenuation and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
