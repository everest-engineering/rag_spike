History: 82 Y/O MALE PT FOUND DOWN AT HOME BY HIS DAUGHTER AT HIS HOME 3 PM. HE WAS DOWN ON THE FLOOR BY HIS BED IN A POOL OF URINE. WITH MORE L SIDED WEAKNESS AND SLURRED SPEECH.PMHX. DMR, HTN, STROKE RIGHT SIDE. 57 CM HEAD
Medications:	METOPROLOL, HEPARIN, INSULIN, AMLODIPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is associated loss of faster frequencies in this region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66 Afib with PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, right hemisphere maximal in the _______.
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
