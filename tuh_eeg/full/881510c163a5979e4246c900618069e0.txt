History:	58 year old female with history of SAH and seizures.
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
Levetiracetam , oxcarbazepine None
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The background is disorganized with large fluctuations in frequencies. There is a fragmentary posterior dominant rhythm that is at times slow (6-7Hz} but at times achieving 9Hz. Background activity was also intermittently characterized by low voltage delta and theta activity (more prominent on the left) with disruption of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  The background is disorganized with large fluctuations in frequencies and amplitudes. Normal sleep architecture was present but at times disrupted by delta and theta activity.
There is intermittent left frontotemporal slowing seen which appears as high amplitude theta activity over the frontotemporal region. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps} does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic , frequent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of background disorganization, diffuse background slowing, fragmentary alpha rhythm, and focal left sided slowing. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction with a possible left hemisphere structural brain lesion. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
