REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman found in asystole and down for 11 minutes in the ER, now with intermittent myoclonic jerks.  She has a history of drug use, HIV, diabetes, hypertension, COPD, hepatitis B, asthma, heart disease, and obesity.

MEDICATIONS:  Lorcet, which was stopped at approximately 7 p.m. at night.  Depacon.

INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during unresponsiveness.  Activating procedures were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a background that consists of overall diffuse theta and beta discharges with no normal organization or frontal central beta.  No clear posterior dominant rhythm could be identified.  The EEG recording appears to remain unchanged throughout the first 24 hours, and with stimulation does not appear to react or change much.  Around 7 p.m., the patient's Versed drip was stopped and there is some mild decrease in the frequency from more alpha to theta, but still some preponderance of an alpha frequency remains at times. Over the next 24 hours, the frequencies in the background slow down to the theta range and the amplitude decreases. they appear to be some unusual reactivity.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slowing in the theta alpha range and disorganization of the background.

SEIZURES:  None.

HEART RATE:  132.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized theta and alpha and diffuse slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The diffuse alpha and theta may be seen with anoxic injury, or alternatively may be at least in part due to medication effect.  The decrease in amplitude could signify cortical damage but the reactivity supports some cortical function. No seizures were seen.
