REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy since childhood, states that it has recently increased due to the heat, feels strange, lies down, awake, with shaking and tongue biting, here for EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Depakote, Zoloft, Aricept.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the left anterior temporal region, and independently in the right anterior temporal region occasionally.  There is 1 discharge while in sleep that appears to be very sharply contoured in the left temporal region, however, not clear epileptiform.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left more than right anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral independent focal cerebral dysfunction in the anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  Please note that some of them are sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptiform.  No seizures were seen.
