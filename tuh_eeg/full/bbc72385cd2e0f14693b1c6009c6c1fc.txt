CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male with epilepsy for the past 14 years described as generalized tonic clonic seizures with incontinence. 2-6 times a month. Past history of childhood epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is lower
amplitude with a 20-30 microvolt 10 hertz alpha rhythm and a amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation is performed early the record increased
in amplitude as the background. Features of drowsiness hypersynchronicity and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits at intermediate and faster/frequencies.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
