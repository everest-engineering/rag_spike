History: 56 year-old woman with history of seizures for the last 5-6 years as associated with alcohol use. No seizure since 8/2013. Patient has history of SDH
Medications: Serax, Keppra
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T11T2 electrodes, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV. 18-25Hz activity is present. maximal over bilateral frontal regions. No normal sleep architecture is present.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.


Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute awake-only EEG. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated. repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
