CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of recent onset of episodes characterized by lightheadedness followed by loss of consciousness.  More recently these episodes have been preceded by left sided headache.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra off, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Spike detector and seizure detector were activated.  The patient was equipped with a push button.   Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an  anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K complexes, slow wave sleep and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  There were no push button events.
FINDINGS:
No events.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal 24-hour continuous audio/video EEG recording.   No epileptiform discharges or ictal events have been captured.  There were no typical events captured.
