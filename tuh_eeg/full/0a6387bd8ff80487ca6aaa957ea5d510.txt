CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed male with epilepsy, status post a childhood
head trauma.

MEDICATIONS: Trileptal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well-organized with
symmetric, reactive 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm. In addition, there is subtle, focal slowing identified

from the tight frontocentral region. In wakefulness, hyperventilation and in photic stimulation,
there are right frontal spike and slow wave complexes of approximately 3 Hz to 5 Hz.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate this and in hyperventilation, the brief bursts are bilateral
although careful review of the epileptiform activity at slow paper speed suggests that the activity
starts on the tight. Bursts are not longer than 1.5 seconds in duration and are not associated

with changes in the background. Hyperventilation does elicit some background slowing and
photic stimulation also elicits some photic driving. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in
background slowing.

HR: 66bpm


Abnormal EEG due to:

1. Frontal spike and slow wave activity.
2. Right frontal spike and slow wave activity.
3. Right focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy. Correlation
with imaging is suggested.
