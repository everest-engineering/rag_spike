CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old woman with recurrent syncopal spells for the past 5 years.  They occur once per month with sudden loss of consciousness and  quick return to baseline.  She may be confused afterwards.  She may have an aura of a strange smell prior to the spells.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  This was a routine 20 minute EEG with photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  There is significant eye movement artifact.  Drowsiness was characterized by generous beta.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with supra harmonic driving.
HEART RATE 48 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The supraharmonic driving was a normal finding, but the electrocardiogram lead was abnormal.
