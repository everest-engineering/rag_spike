CLINICAL HISTORY:  83 year old gentleman with 24 hours of hallucinations and confusion.  History of stroke, diabetes and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Norvasc, Amlodipine, Doxazosin, Insulin, Keppra,  Haldol, Plavix, ASA, Pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG includes a low voltage stage I and stage II  sleep pattern with vertex waves and spindles. In relaxed wakefulness, the background EEG is slow. With tactile stimulation, there is an increase in muscle activity as well as primarily at theta frequency background in an individual who drifts off to sleep.
HR:	70 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is nonspecific and could be due to a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which can include postictal state, dementia or toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were noted. The excessive sleepiness may be evaluated clinically.
