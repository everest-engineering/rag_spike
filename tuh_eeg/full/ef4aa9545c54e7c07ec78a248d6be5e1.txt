CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old male with recurrent syncope since 1985, alcohol abuse, HIV, diabetes, hepatitis C, and paranoid schizophrenia.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, thiamine, trazodone, and heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Technically, this was a somewhat challenging record because the patient had lacerations and bruising of the scalp.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The patient is very sleepy, dropping into stage I or stage II sleep quite readily, including hyperventilation.  Features of sleep include vertex waves, POSTS, and rare spindles.
The patient is again falling asleep during photic stimulation, but a symmetric driving response was identified.
Heart rate:  55 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal low voltage EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
