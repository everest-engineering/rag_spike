History:	40 year old man with a history of nocturnal seizures since the age of 8 years old.
More recently his seizure frequency has improved to ~ 1 seizure every 2 months
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Subtle occasional bilateral posterior quadrant polymorphic theta activity is captured.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, bilateral posterior quadrant, subtle
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 31 minute EEG due to subtle occasional mild-to-
moderate focal bilateral posterior quadrant focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
