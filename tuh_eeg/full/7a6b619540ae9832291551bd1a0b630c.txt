History:	65 year old man who presents with new onset generalized tonic clonic convulsion.
Patient has a history of ETOH abuse.  He also used cocaine within 24 hours of
seizure onset.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute portable EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
