CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34 -year-old woman with loss of consciousness, migraine headaches.  Motor vehicle accident 1 year ago without loss of consciousness but also a history of head trauma 4 to 5 months later with loss of consciousness. Now, the patient has shaking spells lasting 1 to 2 minutes followed by feeling of numbness and then confusion.  This has occurred on 2 occasions.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax as an outpatient.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This was a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Alpha squeak was noted.  POSTs were identified in drowsiness.  Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study capturing more prolonged sleep is suggested.
