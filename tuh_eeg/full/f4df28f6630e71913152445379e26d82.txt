History:	54 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH GEN SZ, LTM
Medications:	Depacon 500mg TUD
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 22.5 hours from 06/29/2015 to 06/30/2015.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	1
Description of pushbutton events
none
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, superimposed frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22.5 hour EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
