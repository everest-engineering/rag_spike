CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old male with chronic static encephalopathy, epilepsy, seizures characterized by staring with foaming at the mouth, typically nocturnal.  No recent seizures for the past 4 years.  Previous seizures included spasticity of the right arm.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible, photic stimulation was completed.  This was a technically challenging, but acceptable record for a challenged adult with continuous eye movement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern.  Frequent eye movements are noted.  There are some occasions where the patient stops with fluttering his eyes and some low voltage, frontal theta is noted, right frontal more than left.  The normal waveforms for an adult are not identified.  There is no alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Paucity of the normal waveforms anticipated for an adult of this age.
Frontal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous records, this EEG is similar to previous studies.  This is a somewhat longer record and it may be a better quality study.  It demonstrates some frontal theta, which was not previously identified.
