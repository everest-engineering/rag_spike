History:	62 YO FEMALE W/ MULTIPLE THROMBO EMBOLIC EVENTS INCLUDING
CONFUSION, UNRESPONSIVENESS AND RIGHT SIDE FACIAL DROOP LASTING 5
MIN. PMHX: FSL & TIA, DVT, PE, CVA, COPD, HTN, PFO.
Medications:	OXYCODONE, ZOSYN, ASA, CYANCOBALAMIN, GABAPENTIN, ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present infrequently.
Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases
during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and mainly in sleep EEG because of excessive theta in
wakefulness and mild disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The patient had a very short sleep latency.
