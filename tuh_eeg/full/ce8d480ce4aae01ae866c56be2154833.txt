Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over the
frontal regions with a slight asymmetry better seen over the right frontal region.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the fronto temporal (F8/T4) region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of beta activity, seen best on
the right and consistent with a breach rhythm.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region,  which is
consistent with the known surgery.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
