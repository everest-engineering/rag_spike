REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

A long-term EEG was performed from 12/12/2012 to 12/13/2012, for a total of 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Zonisamide and Keppra.

HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage with right Pcom aneurysm s/p coiling, now with aneurysm recurrence which recurrence recently had to be clipped.  She has had seizures ever since the subarachnoid hemorrhage, and after the clipping has had recurrent seizures.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the last hours of the recording, the patient had pulled the majority of the electrodes making it difficult to review the EEG, but throughout the majority of the recording, there was a continuous T5 electrode artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye open.  There was normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Patient recorded in wakefulness stage I, stage II and deeper stages of sleep.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves seen continuously at F8/T4 and independently at T4 and frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts continuously, at times with a sharp contour and high amplitude consistent with a breach rhythm.

EVENTS:  The patient had an event at 7:31 p.m. where she felt that she was going to have a seizure.  Seconds later, she stopped answering questions while she was in the chair.  She would stare and remain unresponsive for about 3 minutes.  She would not follow motor or verbal commands.  During the entire episode, the patient had a normal background and no epileptiform activity was seen.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right anterior temporal and mid temporal slowing.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal and mid temporal region, which is consistent with a known surgery and injury.  In addition, there was one episode of unresponsiveness where the patient had no changes in her EEG.  This is consistent with a diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic event.  No seizures were seen.
