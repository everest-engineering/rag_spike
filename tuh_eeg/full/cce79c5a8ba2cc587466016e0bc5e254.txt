CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with depression and memory impairment. Mother and sister have same syndrome.

MEDICATIONS: Ecotrin, Trazodone, Zolpidem, Klonopin, Effexor, Hydroxyzine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 microvolt alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by central theta. Vertex waves and spindles re noted in stage II sleep. POSTS are noted. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Hyperventilation elicits a small amount of theta.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing prolonged sleep is suggested.
