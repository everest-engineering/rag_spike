CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of ALL, syncope and previous CNS involvement with his malignancy.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity and a small amount of occasional, frontal theta.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta.  Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A small amount of excess beta.
A small amount of excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The excess beta and theta may be due to this patient's medications.
