CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old male who had a seizure on Sunday with left arm numbness and shaking.  No family history of seizures or other problems.  Focal arm movements with blank stare, but no loss of consciousness, followed by headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, tramadol, and Prozac.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep 20-minute record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm were seen, but stage 2 sleep was not achieved.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation produces a driving response.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 1 sleep.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
