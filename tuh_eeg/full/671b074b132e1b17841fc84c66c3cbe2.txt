History: 21 year old man from Guatemala who developed worsening left sided weakness, subsequently found to have toxoplasmosis, HIV and ICH, requiring ventriculostomy.
Medications: cefepime, phenylephrine
EEG Type: Awake & asleep, portable
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T11T2 electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity Is characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with under riding theta and beta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. There Is paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere. No normal sleep architecture is present
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was reactivity to auditory, tactile, and painful stimuli characterized by appearance of subtle frontal fast activity.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing that Is more pronounced over the left hemisphere. Diffuse slowing is etiologically nonspecific indicator of moderate-to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. No electrographic seizures are present.
