CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old right-handed woman, admitted last month with right-sided weakness, now returning with left-sided weakness . History of stroke, diabetes, hypertension, and hypotension. ? Multiple sclerosis?
MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, metoprolol, Ativan, heparin, lisinopril, Plavix, insulin, others.
INTRODUCTION: A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  In maximal wakefulness, there is a glimpse of an 8 to 9 hertz alpha rhythm and an overall background, which in beta and theta.  Notable features in this record include bursts of arrhythmic delta activity or focal slowing in the right hemisphere with prominent disruption of faster frequency activity in that hemisphere. In addition, there are bursts of focal slowing with more rhythmic mixed theta delta from the left hemisphere.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent shifting slowing.
More arrhythmic delta activity and more disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere relative to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform features were seen. The EEG pattern described above is a history of bilateral stroke.
