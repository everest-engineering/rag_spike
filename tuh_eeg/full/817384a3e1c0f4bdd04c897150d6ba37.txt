AGE: 73 y .o.
SEX : female
START DATE OF STUDY: 11/13/2015 at 11:19 END DATE OF STUDY: 11/14/2015 at 11:52
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : ICU EEG TYPE: LTM
EEG #: 15-321.1-2
HISTORY:
73 y.o. female with a history of CHF, RV failure, OSA, morbid obesity, HTN, OM, stroke 2009, CKD, who presented with L arm cramping and was found in PEA arrest, referred for EEG as part of hypothermia protocol.Temp of 31 C reached 11/13/15 at 01:00. Normothermic at 11/14/2015 at 09:00.
MEDICATIONS: propofol stopped 11/13/2015 at 09:00 SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	{EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
DAY 1 (11/13/2015, 11:19 - 11/14/2015, 06:00) BACKGROUND:
The background consists of burst suppression.	Bursts are
characterized by 2-4 second periods of disorganized theta and delta. Periods of suppression last up to 190 seconds.
As this day progresses, at times the bursts appear higher in amplitude over the right temporal region .
There is no reactivity, variability, or state change. Spontaneous eye blinks and chewing artifact are present.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
EVENTS:
Clinical: The patient bites down on the tube for 5-15 seconds at a time.
EEG: Spontaneous chewing artifact is captured on EEG that correlates. There is no underlying epileptiform activity. This artifact resolves by 11/13/15 17:00
HEART RATE:
A single EKG captures a heart rate of 54 bpm.
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal study due to:
- Burst suppression pattern with lack of reactivity, variability, or state change. At times bursts appear higher in amplitude over right temporal region.
Biting movements, which have no epileptiform correlate
These findings are consistent with severe cerebral dysfunction, which is likely at least in part related to hypothermic state. The chewing motions captured are not seizures.
DAY 2 (11/14/2015, 06:00 - 11/14/2015, 11:52)
BACKGROUND: No change GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change FOCAL SLOWING : None
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) : None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS :No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Unchanged from Day 1.
Biting movements not captured on this day.
FINAL IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern with lack of reactivity, variability, or state change. At times bursts appear higher in amplitude over right temporal region.
Biting movements, which have no epileptiform correlate, seen on Day 1
FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with severe cerebral dysfunction, which is likely at least in part related to hypothermic state. There is intermittent asymmetry in amplitude of the bursts; correlation with imaging is recommended.
The chewing motions captured are not seizures .
