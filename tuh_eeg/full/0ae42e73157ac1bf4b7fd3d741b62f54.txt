CLINICAL HISTORY:  85 year old woman with a history of stroke and dementia.  She had an episode in the ambulance with left facial droop and left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lovenox, Aricept.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized.  There is a lower voltage on posterior dominant rhythm of approximately I have heard.  There is an asymmetry with lower voltage delta noted on the right compared to the left and disruption of faster frequency activity on the right. Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Significant generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry with significant slowing on the right compared to the left.
A dynamic pattern with to some extent improvement and slowing on the left by the end of the EEG with improvement with an alpha rhythm reaching 7.5 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp edge or spikes were noted.  The right focal slowing suggests process in the right involving waves, gray and white matter.  The generalized background slowing may be part of this patient's dementia. This EEG demonstrated improvement on the left over time, which might be seen in toxic or metabolic phenomena.  It can also be seen in any improvement condition, which does include postictal state.
