History:	51 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF SZ WHO IS ON DILANTIN MONOTHERAPY FROM
PUERTO RICO. SHE REPORTED HAVING 6 - 8 SZ'S A MONTH
FOLLOW UP EEG 2/25/14 NO REPORTED SZ.
Medications:	NAPROSYN, HYDRODIURIL, ACCUNES, KENALOG, ZOLOFT, ABILIFY,
TYLENOL, ZOCOR, DILANTIN, LAMICTAL, ZITHROMAX, ATROVENT,
SEREVENT, PROVENTIL, SYMBICORT
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is present in the left temporal ( maximum at F7) region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
