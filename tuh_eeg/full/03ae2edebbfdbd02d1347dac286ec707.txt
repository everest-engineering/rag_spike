CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed female with persistent headache.

MEDICATIONS: Amitriptyline, Excedrin, Tylenol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EEG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm in a background with generous beta activity and a small amount of background theta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing.

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background disorganization.
2. Minimal excess theta.

CLINICAL No epileptiform features are observed. The findings described above may be due to this patient's medications.
