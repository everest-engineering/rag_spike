ORIGINAL
CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed female with a history of stroke found down and
coded for 10╖20 minutes with myoclonus, now more stable without any myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl, Vancomycin, Zosyn.
REASON FOR STUDY
Follow up after hypoxic event
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode
placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrode. No activating procedures we e
performed. The patient was comatose, unresponsive during the recording.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: Marked muscle artifact in the right anterior temporal
OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow background that at
best has 1╖2 Hz with a very low amplitude. No posterior dominant rhythm or fronto-central beta
Is seen. No sleep architecture is seen. No activating procedures were performed.
2. At times there is infrequent F7fT3 slow wave seen Intermittently at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of
20-40 mV.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slow waves.
2. Intermittent left anterior temporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left
anterior temporal region as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific
with a to etiology. No seizures nor epileptiform discharges were seen.
