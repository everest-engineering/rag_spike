RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE: Routine EEG #: 15-1258
HISTORY:
48 y.o. RH woman with loss of consciousness. PMHX NO H/O SZ. 57 CM HEAD SEIZURE VS SYNCOPE PT SAYS SHE HAS A HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM
MEDICATIONS: NO AEDs
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a well organized mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by
a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present. ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: None performed Photic Stimulation: None performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
