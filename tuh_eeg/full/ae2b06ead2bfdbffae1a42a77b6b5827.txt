CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old right handed woman with a single seizure in 2004,
status post lap band surgery, now with sleep disturbance, impair d memory, and an
episode of right arm numbness.

MEDICATIONS: Actos, Benicar, Januvia.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record. here are minor
correctable technical irregularities are present in the record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears to be sleepy, and the
overall background is relatively low voltage when awake, but an 11-Hz alpha
rhythm. Abundant stage 2 sleep includes beta spindles of 24 Hz and vertex waves.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting into stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. It also serves to
keep the patient awake.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Generous beta in wakefulness and sleep.
2. A low voltage pattern.
3. An excessively sleepy patient.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. to the patient's
excessive sleepiness and possible snoring heard on the recording a sleep study is
recommended.
