CLINICAL HISTORY:
27-year-old lady with history of cerebral palsy and seizures. Has been seizure-free for over five years.
MEDICATIONS:
Zonisamide
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In wakefulness, she has an alpha rhythm of 9.2 Hz. This is relatively well organized. There was a single burst of frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity, appearing to be coming out of the night with a preceding polyspike complex. The burst was seen during hyperventilation. Drowsiness is characterized by some generalized slowing, and she demonstrates spindles in stage II sleep. It was also characterized by K complexes, post and vertex waves.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing in theta frequency and a single burst of 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity seen to be originating from the right frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This pattern could be seen in primary or secondary generalized epilepsy, and this could suggest more than one neurological problem. We would recommend comparing this EEG to previous EEGs during childhood. In a 2009 EEG she had a single awake Vertex wave
ATTESTATION STATEMENT FOR THE EEG LAB:
I personally the EEG with the resident and reviewed the dictation. I agree with this report.
