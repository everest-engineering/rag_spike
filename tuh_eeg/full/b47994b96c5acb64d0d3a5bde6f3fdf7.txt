HISTORY: 23 year old right handed male with a past medical history of drug abuse. The patient ingested Xanax yesterday and began to have hallucinations. Past history of
hallucinations in childhood as well as episodes of dizziness, loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic
seizures
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG demonstrates an 8.7
Hz alpha rhythm and a background with generous beta. In relaxed wakefulness, there is a small
amount of shifting, right or left temporal mixed theta delta. Features of drowsiness include
rhythmic, frontocentral theta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an
alerting response. There are some bursts of paroxysmal frontal slowing noted in
hyperventilation. There is a bit more rhythmic 3 Hz activity noted from the left in hyperventilation
and in the drowsy pattern that follows. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 80 bpm with occasional PVC's.
The EEG is notable for.
2. Rare bursts of shifting right or left temporal slowing.
3. Additional focal features which include some rhythmic left frontotemporal 3 Hz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The beta activity described above may be associated with the
Xanax ingestion. Some of the slowing described above may also be attributable to medicines. In
this individual with a past history of epilepsy, the rhythmic 3 Hz to 4 Hz activity in the left
temporal region may represent a localizing feature for his epilepsy. A follow-up study when the
patient has been drug-free may be of value.
