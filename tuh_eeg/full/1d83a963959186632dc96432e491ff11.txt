CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 35-year-old male with learning disability and epilepsy.  Seizures include tonic-clonic seizures since the age of 10 with generalized shaking, yelling and dizziness.  Additional seizures include head shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically essentially acceptable 40-minute EEG with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 hertz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal and central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles were seen in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, producing a small increase in theta as well as an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 3rd normal EEG for this patient over a 7-year-period.  If the patient is found to have frequent seizures, additional EEG recording strategies may be employed.
