History:	46 year old man who presents with a possible seizure.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal, the background consists of low amplitude 9.5-10 Hz alpha activity with
expected AP gradient.  However, for the majority of the recording the background consists of 8 Hz
theta activity posteriorly with poor AP gradient.  During drowsiness, the degree of theta activity
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
