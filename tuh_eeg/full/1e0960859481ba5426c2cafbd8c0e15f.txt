CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old, right-handed gentleman, with history of headache and seizures who presents for followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonazepam, tramadol, amitriptyline.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10 Hz in frequency, 10-30 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is diffuse low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording, capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.  Generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
