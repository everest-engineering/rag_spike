History:	19 yr male with episodes of heart palpitations, exhaustion and confusion x 30 sec.
Medications:	Concerta, Strattera, Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Patient remains awake throughout the entire study.

Continuous polymorphic theta activity at higher voltages is present in the right posterior quadrant. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild generalized slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at all flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of 100-120 bpm.

Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right posterior No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23-minute EEG due to continuous mild right posterior quadrant focal slowing. Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of 100-120 bpm.
