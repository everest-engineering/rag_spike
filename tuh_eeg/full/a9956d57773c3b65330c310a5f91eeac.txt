CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 72-year-old lung transplant recipient; hospitalized for rejection; now with anemia, fever, and generalized weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Solu-Medrol, labetalol, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically good study in a patient, who had difficulty cooperating with testing and there was a significant amount of muscle and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta.  Shifting asymmetries were noted.  There is a slight asymmetry with a bit more beta noted in the left central region relevant to the right.  The patient's episodes of agitation and screaming were without an epileptiform correlate.
At the close of the record, the patient is a bit more cooperative and there is a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm noted bilaterally.
Heart rate 105 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 20-minute ICU record due to:
Background slowing and poor organization.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study when the patient is a bit more cooperative may be undertaken in search of epileptiform activity.
