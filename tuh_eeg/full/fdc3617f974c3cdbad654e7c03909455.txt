CLINICAL HISTORY: Adult female, status post suicide attempt with multiple ingestions including multiple pills and antifreeze.  Possible seizure-like event, responsive to 4 mg Ativan.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan.
I NTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Impedances were generally under 5 kilohms, although there was a great deal of ICU artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a continuous mixed frequency pattern with generous beta, and smaller amounts of theta and delta. Occasional bursts of slow frontal delta were noted.  By the end of the record, the patient is more awake with eye opening and eye closure. The EEG remained slow with a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but excess beta and theta were noted.
Heart rate: 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. The background EEG may represent medication affect. If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study may be a value.
