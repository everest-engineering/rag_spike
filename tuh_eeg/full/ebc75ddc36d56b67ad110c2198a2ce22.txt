History:	28 year old female with a history of epilepsy. Patient had 3 seizures on 6/16/14.
Patient is currently pregnant.
Medications:	Lamotrigine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right temporooccipital region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right, temporooccipital
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep  23-minute EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the
right temporooccipital region.  This finding is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly
structural in etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
