CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old male with bilateral frontoparietal craniotomy and cerebral tumor. Worsening right-sided weakness.  History of post-polio syndrome.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, metformin, aspirin, lidocaine, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively lethargic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At bedside, portable EEG demonstrates a lower voltage, diffusely slow record with a relatively featureless pattern in the frontal central regions.  There is a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm, better demonstrated on the right in comparison to the left.  The patient has nearly a continuous frequent eye blink.
The patient is tested during the EEG and is responsive to commands.
Heart rate 132 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A relatively low voltage featureless record in the frontal central regions.
A somewhat disorganized and slow background.
An asymmetry with a bit more alpha frequency activity on the right in comparison to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The recent surgical intervention may play a role in the changes noted in the frontal regions.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be of value.
