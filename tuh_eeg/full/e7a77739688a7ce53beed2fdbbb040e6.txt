CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with epilepsy, now with complaint of impaired verbal memory.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The patient transitioned between wakefulness and sleep with an increase in beta during sleep.
In hyperventilation and in the transition to sleep, there is subtle, underlying focal slowing noted from the left temporal region with scant temporal theta.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
By the close of the record, the patient is transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles as well as snore artifact.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
subtle left temporal focal slowing, primarily seen in drowsiness or hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is 5th EEG for this patient.  A previous study in 2007 identified similar findings.  No sharp waves or spikes have been seen in any of the EEGs.
