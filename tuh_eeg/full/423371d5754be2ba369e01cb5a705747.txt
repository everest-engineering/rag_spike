CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed female presented with headache and transient unilateral paresthesias.
MEDICATIONS: ASA
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed ..t bedside using
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient reports an
improvement in her unilateral numbness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes a symmetric pattern with a 10Hz
alpha rhythm, vertex waves; K-comp!exes, and spindles. In the transition in and out of
sleep, there is sometimes an asymmetry with an alpha rhythm that emerges on the right before
the left. More particularly, in the morning on the 3rd, there is some more clear-cut lower voltage
focal slowing-in the' left -occipital temporal region. The sleep recording this individual is more
symmetric on this day of recording.
HR 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Continuous video EEG recording for this individual with intermittent unilateral
numbness was remarkable for:
1..
The absence of sharp waves or spikes.
2.
Intermittent asymmetries, some of which were as anticipated with disruption of faster
frequency activity in the left hemisphere and some theta.
3.
Asymmetric vertex waves which may be maximum in the left or right central region, as well
as shifting asymmetries or lack of coherence with normal wave forms.
_
CLINICAL Although this patient's clinical symptoms of unilateral numbness
improved over time, the focal slowing on the left was a bit more prominent later on in the record.
If her spells of unilateral hemisensory numbness are, in fact, epileptiform, scalp EEG has not
been successful hi capturing epileptiform activity and other techniques may be valuable .
