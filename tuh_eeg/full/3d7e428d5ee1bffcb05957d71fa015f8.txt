History:	54 year old woman who presents with right facial droop and aphasia.  Patient also
has fever.
Medications:	NO AED
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The background consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8.5 Hz alpha posteriorly, poor AP
gradient and diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present
but periods of quiescence are captured.
Intermittent subtle polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 90.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing and intermittent
subtle moderate left frontotemporal focal slowing. Diffuse background slowing is a nonspecific
indicator of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Intermittent focal slowing is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
