CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male with a history of a hypoxic brain injury in 2008, followed by epilepsy.  The patient recently was experiencing auras which resolved when medications were adjusted.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Xanax, oxycodone, clonidine, melatonin, and Remeron.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable record capturing wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is scant background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with vertex waves and beta noted in sleep.  POSTS were also noted.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was falling asleep, but did elicit drowsy response.  Heart rate was 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is the third EEG for this individual which was remarkable for:
Mild excess theta.
The absence of epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features have been identified for this individual on any occasion.  The background theta may be related to this patient's medications or CNS insult.
