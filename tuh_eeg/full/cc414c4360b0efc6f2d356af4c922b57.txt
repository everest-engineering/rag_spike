History:	PT HAS HAD TUMOR BEHIND HER R EYE SINCE 10YO
BY 2006, IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY GONE.
ABOUT 6MTHS AGO, IT REOCCURRED.
SHE NEEDS EEG BEFORE SHE SEES NEUROSURGEON THIS Month.
CANNOT SEE THRU R EYE.
HAS HAD MAJOR HEADACHES AND DIZZY SPELLS.
HAD SURGERIES @ 11YO,
Medications:	No AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr 78
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
