History:	50 YR MALE WITH EPISODES OF LEFT UE SPASMS AND STARING. WITH
TONGUE SORE AND JAW SORE.  SYNCOPE VS SZ  PMHX: PARAPLEGIC GSW
2002. DVT, FOUND TO HAVE KIDNEY STONES TUBE PLACED.
Medications:	BACLOFEN, GABAPENTIN, WARFARIN, METHADONE, ZOFRAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Frequent bursts (lasting  up to a 1.5 minutes) of 100-200uV, 1-3Hz
rhythmic bifrontal predominant slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency
during drowsiness.  There are intermittent jerk seen on video and the patient complains of jaw
tightness during the episode.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1 flash per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Other, burst of frontal predominant delta slowing
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of burst of diffuse frontal predominant
delta. These findings are indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific. In this case the transient nature of the events may suggest a intermittent diffuse process
like a sudden state change (sleep disorder), decreased blood flow  , hypoglycemia or even a hypercapnic/hypoxic state.
