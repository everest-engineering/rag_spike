LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of spells of memory loss and falling events without loss of consciousness that occurred about 1 year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well formed and modulated 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Fast alpha variant is captured.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta and delta are observed.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
