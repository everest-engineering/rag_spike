History: 22 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O MULTI SZ THAT LEAD TO DX OF MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMOR. REMOVAL ON 1/2/2014. PT DENIES ANY SZ ACTIVITY SINCE SURGERY. 56 CM HEAD SURGERY IN C4 T4 AREA.
Medications:
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake EEG. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
