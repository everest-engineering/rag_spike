GOING,DEMENTIA
Medications: ARICEPT, FOLIC ACID, PRILOSEC, CYMBALTA, CELEBREX, LAMICTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:
Routine. awake & drowsy
Technique:
international 10·20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes. awake, drowsy, photic
DESCRIPTION
Posterior dominant rhythm is characterized by a 30-40uV6.5 Hz theta rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric and diffuse 20-30 uV. 18-25 Hz diffuse beta activity is
present maximal over bilateral frontocentral regions. Excess diffuse admixed 30-50 u V.Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. During drowsiness, the PDR attenuates with more slowing of the background activity.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1·21 Hashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, frequent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow PDR. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators or mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Diffuse beta activity could be due to medication effects.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
