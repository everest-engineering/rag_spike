History:	26 year old woman status post cardiac arrest.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a variable burst-suppression, from ~1:1
to up to 1:10.  Bursts consists of moderate amplitude 6-7 Hz theta activity.  Bursts last ~1-1.5
seconds.  Majority of the bursts are associated with high amplitude very brief EMG artifact.
Clinically, this EMG artifact correlates with a brief upper body/ facial jerk.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of
~120-130 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable comatose 21-minute EEG due to burst-suppression pattern.  This
indicates marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific. A brief myoclonic jerk
is not related to an ictal correlate.  No electrographic seizures are present.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates heart rate of ~120-130 bpm.
