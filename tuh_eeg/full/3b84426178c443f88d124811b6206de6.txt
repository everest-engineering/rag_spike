CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old female with epilepsy, break through seizures on the
8th despite compliance with medications.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lisinopril, Tylenol, Famotidine, Lasix, Plavix, Lovenox, Levothyroxine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates focal slowing from the right hemisphere with rhythmic delta. Some of it is sharply contoured. The patient arouses and when she does so the left hemisphere demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern with generous beta and scant 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of excess theta. Rhythmic slowing is identified on the right with sharply contoured delta at T2. Features of stage I sleep include prominent vertex waves. She transitions in and out of sleep. Toward the end of the record, the pattern from the left is not as slow as seen in the initial sections of the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving from the left hemisphere.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
2. Right mid to anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Transient background slowing from the left improving over time.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The dynamic features described on the left with improvement over time can be part of postictal pathology. The overall EEG is similar to previous studies. No seizures were recorded.
