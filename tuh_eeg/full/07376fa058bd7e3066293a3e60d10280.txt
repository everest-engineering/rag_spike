CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman status post cardiac arrest, long hospitalization for 2 weeks.  Cardiac Arrest 10 days prior to the EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, tazobactam, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the  bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was described as intubated and comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern.  It is overall suppressed with brief bursts of mixed theta and alpha frequency activity which is most prominent in the frontal regions.  This activity is typically to 600 milliseconds in duration.  It is a bit variable in terms of the quantities of alpha versus theta activity.  It is relatively symmetric.

Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record.

No involuntary eye movements were noted.

Heart rate 104 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Burst suppression pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG carries a worrisome prognosis 10 days following cardiac arrest.  If additional information is needed alternative neurodiagnostic tests such as the above potentials may be value.
