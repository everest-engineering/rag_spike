DATE OF STUDY:  February 1 through February 2

CLINICAL HISTORY:

MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin and many others.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the EEG monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had none of her typical tonic-clonic seizures with aura during this section of the record.  She began to complain of an increasing feeling of claustrophobia and requested that her EEG monitoring session was terminated on the morning of 02/02/2013.  Her Depakote dose had been held.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  In the transition to drowsiness, there was some hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.

The time frame in which the patient was feeling uncomfortable and requesting to leave was reviewed.  Although there were no push buttons for those symptoms, no epileptiform discharges were noted at that time.

Heart rate 84 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has some benign epileptiform variance noted in drowsiness including rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness but no seizures or definitive ictal discharges were noted.
