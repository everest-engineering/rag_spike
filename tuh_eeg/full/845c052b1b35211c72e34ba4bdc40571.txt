AGE: 43 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/17/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1687
HISTORY:
43 y.o. male with a history of seizures (last 2 days ago, with a total of 2 seizures this year) . Also has a history of alcohol and drug use and gunshot wound to head, s/p cranioplasty (right central region) in 1997.
MEDICATIONS :
Keppra
SEDATION : None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes an utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
There is a right central (C4 max) breach rhythm .
During drowsiness,·slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and · fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180
seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy	routine EEG due to:
1. A right central (C4) breach rhythm
2. Occasional left temporal polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left temporal cerebral dysfunction .
The right central breach rhythm is consistent with the patient' s reported prior history of skull defect.
