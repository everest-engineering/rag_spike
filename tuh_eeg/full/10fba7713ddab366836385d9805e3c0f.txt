GLUCOSE LEVEL.
SMHX:: ALCOHOL, 1.5 PACK A DAY SMOKER
Medications:	ASPIRIN, CODEINE, PERIACTIN, TAGAMET, TOPROL-XL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse 7Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  2) occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction in this region.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
