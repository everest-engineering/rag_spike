CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed female with a history of seizure onset on October 9, was general tonoclonic activity. Her last seizure was one week ago. Patient also has a history of depression and arthritis.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Gabapentin, Lyrica, Lamictal, Asacol, Prozac, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG in the awake state is well-organized. The background consists of alpha but is less vigorous. Photic stimulation was performed, and it produced supraharmonic driving. Hyperventilation was performed, also. There was no seizure activity, no focal or epileptiform features.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity or focal features were found. Absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Additional EEG may be useful to capture any epileptiform activity. May want to consider outpatient DigiTrace.
