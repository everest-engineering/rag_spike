CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman who had an episode of sudden left arm weakness followed by slurred speech.  Lupus, mitral valve disease, multiple medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Plaquenil, insulin, aspirin, others.  __________
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is an awake and asleep record.  Technical:  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  The drowsy record is very low voltage with attenuation of the alpha rhythm posts and then lower voltage vertex waves.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for significant muscle artifact, but there is a driving response.
Heart rate 50 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
