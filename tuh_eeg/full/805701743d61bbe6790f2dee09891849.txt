TIME OF RECORDING: 10:25 p.m. 05/21/2013 until approximately 8:30 am on 5/22/2013
TOTAL LENGTH OF RECORDING: 9 hours, 43 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY: An unknown male presents with change in mental status. EEG is being performed to rule out status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: None listed.
INTRODUCTION: The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
The recording was performed continuously. The patient was provided with the event button. Medical staff notes and nursing staff notes were reviewed. The study was reviewed at least once during the 24 hour period.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING: There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency gradient. The background is continuous and grossly symmetrical. During maximal wakefulness the background consists of low amplitude diffuse beta activity without clear anterior to posterior frequency gradient. During sleep, vertex waves and frequent diffuse bursts of spindle-like waveforms are captured. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation not performed. Single EKG demonstrates an increased heart rate that, at times, averages above 100 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
1. Disorganized background.
2. Excess beta.
3. No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal nearly 10 hour continuous audio video EEG monitoring due to diffuse background disorganization. This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that in this case could partially be related to the medication effect. Excess beta could be secondary to the medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. No electrographic seizures
