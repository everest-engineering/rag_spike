History:	80 year old man status post head trauma.
Medications:	no sedation and no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
During arousals/ with stimulation the background consists of polymorphic low amplitude 9 Hz alpha
activity posteriorly with fragmented AP gradient and excess polymorphic low amplitude theta
activity.  There is paucity of faster frequencies and mild voltage attenuation over the right,
especially over the right temporal region.  There are clearly state changes with periods of
quiescence characterized by diffuse sleep-spindle-like complexes.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is reactivity to visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, nearly continuous, mild, right hemispheric, especially over the temporal region
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, mild-to-moderate, especially over the
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 1 hour EEG in an obtunded patient.  There is mild diffuse slowing
and continuous focal slowing and mild voltage attenuation over the right, especially over the right
temporal region. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and voltage attenuation are indicative of a
focal structural lesion over the right, possibly secondary to a fluid collection between a skull and
brain (such as a hematoma, empyema).  There is clear background reactivity and sleep/ wake
