CLINICAL HISTORY: 	27 year old left handed woman with refractory epilepsy, currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with 11 Hz 40 mcv posterior dominant rhythm. Early in drowsiness there is an increase in theta.  Hyperventilation produces a significant amount of eye flutter. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.
HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No temporal lobe sharp waves were observed today. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
