History:	24 year old woman with multiple seizures post-delivery.  Last seizure occurred ~2
weeks ago
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Bursts of diffuse theta and delta are noted during wakefulness.  These
bursts of activity resemble though seen during drowsiness/ sleep.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Other, intrusions of sleep architecture into wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is mildly abnormal awake and mostly asleep 25-minute EEG due to intrusions of drowsiness
into wakefulness.  This indicates excessively drowsy/ sleep deprived patient. The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
