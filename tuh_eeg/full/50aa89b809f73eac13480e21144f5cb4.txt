STUDY DATE:  12/10/2012 to 12/12/2012 for a total of 48 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with __________ aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage followed by coiling and later on with recurrence and clipping.  She has had a history of seizures ever since the subarachnoid hemorrhage and has recently worsened.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, zonisamide, and Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Long-term EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software and patient events and nurses notes were all used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the last 4-6 hours of the recording, multiple electrodes have been lost, and there is multielectrode artifact as well as movement artifact, making it difficult to review some of the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm in the range of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere at F8/T4 and at T4 independently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously with an associated breach in the rhythm.
EVENTS:  None noted.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to right anterior temporal and mid-temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the right anterior temporal and mid-temporal regions, which is consistent with a known hemorrhage and injury to that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
