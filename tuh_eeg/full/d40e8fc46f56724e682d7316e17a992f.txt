CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old gentleman with history of head trauma during the Vietnam War, subsequent subdural hematoma in recent seizures, history of craniotomy 4 years ago.  Alcohol and cocaine abuse.  Admitted with multiple grand mal seizures, evaluate for status epilepticus due to obtundation. CT with Multiple fixation plate and screws due to prior high bilateral craniotomy
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan 12 mg, propofol 100 mg, propofol drip, others.
INTRODUCTION:  20 minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient was intubated and poorly responsive.  Tactile and auditory stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, the overall pattern demonstrates a low voltage, a beta frequency pattern.  There is a small amount of theta and a suggestion of perhaps a bit more delta in the posterior regions.  As the recording continues, sedative medications were held and spontaneous arousals were noted.
Tactile stimulation of the patient produced motor withdrawal, but no arousal.
Heart rate 74 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a sedated pattern of diffuse beta.
Posterior slowing, perhaps right more than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta may be due to this patient's medications.  Ongoing EEG monitoring will be employed to assess potential subclinical seizures.
