History:	37 year old woman undergoing hypothermia protocol.
Medications:	Propofol and fentanyl,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~24 hours from 11/11/2015 to 11/12/2015.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
During periods of decreased sedation and arousals, the background consists of a mixture of
moderate amplitude frequencies (primarily theta and alpha activity).  The majority of the
background is sedated with slow diffuse delta activity with overriding sleep-spindle-like waveforms
and a mixture of theta and delta.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Other, sedated recording
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous 24-hour video EEG due to variable degree of diffuse slowing.
This finding is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in
this patient is primarily related to medication effect.
