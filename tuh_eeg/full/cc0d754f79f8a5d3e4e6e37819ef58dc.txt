CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 61-year-old male with autoimmune encephalitis.  Patient has intermittent episodes of hand trembling associated with tachycardia.
MEDICINES:  Seroquel, Lamictal, Xanax, Deltasone, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable 22 minute EEG, although impedances were not checked.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, and scant background theta.  Lambda was noted in wakefulness.
Hyperventilation was associated with an increase in theta.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
HEART RATE: irregular, 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for
mild excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified with this record.  The background theta is a nonspecific finding, which may be part of this patient's diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Additional EEG monitoring will be completed to more completely characterize this individual's epileptiform activity.
