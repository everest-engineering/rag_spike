REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old man with a history of seizures as a child and had been seizure-free over 5 years.  Evaluation to stop medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F8/T4 and at times at T4 occasionally throughout the recording in drowsiness and wakefulness.
Focal slow waves at F8/T4 seen intermittently, one time read  monomorphically consistent with temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right anterior temporal and midtemporal sharp waves in addition to focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right anterior temporal or midtemporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right midtemporal to anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
