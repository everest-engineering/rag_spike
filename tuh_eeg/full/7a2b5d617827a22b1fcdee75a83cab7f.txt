CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old right handed male admitted October 25, with prolonged tonic clonic seizure and prolonged postictal state. Past left MCA infarct, bilateral cerebellar infarcts and atherosclerosis.
MEDICATIONS:   Ativan, Zocor, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is awake and responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is generous beta. There is an 8 Hertz MU rhythm identified on the right and a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. In addition to the generous beta activity, there is rhythmic mixed theta delta in the left frontocentral/frontotemporal region. As the patient drifts off to sleep, there is an increase in beta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. There are a handful of discrete, left frontal FP1 sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Rhythmic slowing in the left frontal region.
Rare discrete left frontal sharp waves.
