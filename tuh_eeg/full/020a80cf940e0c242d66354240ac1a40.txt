CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old woman, with migraine headaches and generalized tonic-clonic seizure, twice, 1 year ago.  Past history of head trauma with left intracerebral hemorrhage as well as asthma, heart murmur, and current pregnancy. Also 3 family  members with epilepsy
MEDICINES:  Albuterol, Ventolin, and Flonase.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This was an awake and asleep record. Hyperventilation was deferred
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Maximal wakefulness, there is an 8 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal, central beta activity.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  The patient is noted to have bruxism with muscle artifact, teeth grinding noted in the transition in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Rare asymmetries are noted with subtle focal slowing in the right central temporal region and slight disruption of faster frequency activity in that region noted in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG due to
Rare right central temporal focal slowing.
Slow alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The bruxism is a dental problem.  The subtle features described above may be correlated with the patient's previous history of traumatic brain injury.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study in search of epileptiform activity may be of value.
