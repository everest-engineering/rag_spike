CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old female who fell out of bed with ¥syncope" but was amnestic
for the event
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10á20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is
a 7 -s Hertz alpha rhythm but there is excess theta and shilling arrhythmic delta activity. In
addition, there is some sharp waves observed in the right temporal region. There is also some
artifact in this area but there is some clear larger or smaller discrete sharp waves noted.
Features of drowsiness include increase in rhythmic slowing. The sharp waves are much more
prominent and evolve into isolated higher amplitude spikes with after going slow waves. Photic
stimulation is performed with good cooperation and in photic stimulation, the patient is much
more alert with a well-defined 8.3 Hertz alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation produced a significant
driving response.
HR: bpm
IMPRESSION: normal EEG due to:
1. Mild to moderate degree of background slowing and disorganization.
2. A right anterior temporal sharp and slow wave with spike and stow wave complex which
ranges from small amplitude to higher amplitude with a well-defined after going slow wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
