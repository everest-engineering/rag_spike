CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman with a reported seizure several days ago, characterized by generalized shaking, tongue biting.  No previous seizures recorded.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is intermittent rhythmic or somewhat irregular slowing noted in the right mid temporal region with bursts of slowing of 3-6 seconds in duration.  Stage 2 sleep includes spindle activity.
Hyperventilation also seems to accentuate intermittent burst of right temporal focal slowing and disruption of faster frequency activity from the right.
This EEG seems to have some asymmetric eye artifacts and some EKG artifact, but there is a small, discrete right temporal sharp waves noted in the background.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to ;
right temporal somewhat rhythmic focal slowing identified in the transition in and out of drowsiness and hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Because there is only a single spike which can be identified in this record, this must be considered artifact, but it is in the same region as the rhythmic and focal slowing.  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the right.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged sleep study or a study with special electrodes may be of use.
