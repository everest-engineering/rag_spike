CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed woman status post assault with worsening of epilepsy.  History of childhood epilepsy, but worsening seizures following the assault.  Onset of epilepsy at age 14.  Events  witnessed by correctional facility employees not otherwise described.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Tegretol, Depakote.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient was cooperative with the study.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG includes an 8 to 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta as well as beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are occasional, isolated bursts of sharply contoured right temporal delta. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG  due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Rare bursts of right temporal sharply contoured slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background theta was described in a previous EEG, but this is the first EEG to demonstrate sharply contoured slowing on the right.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study capturing one of this patient's spells may be of value.
