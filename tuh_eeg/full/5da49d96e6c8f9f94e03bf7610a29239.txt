History:	54 YR FOLLOW UP STUDY AFTER A BREAKTHROUGH SZ AND NOT RETURNING
TO BASELINE 3/3/14.
STATUS POST LEFT CRANIECTOMY, DURAPLASTY AND SEIZURES.
Medications:	Dilantin, Keppra, Phenobarbital, Midazolam, Coumadin, Lovenox, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Background activity is characterized by hemispheric asymmetry with left hemispheric slowing and
attenuation.  The posterior dominant rhythm is well-formed over the right occipital region with a
frequency of 8.5-9 Hz that attenuates with eye opening.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm in the
with occipital region attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear.
Continuous polymorphic low voltage delta activity is present in the left hemispheric region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional left temporo-occipital (T5-O1) sharp waves
are present with no evolution.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Diffuse EMG artifact is noted during most of the recording.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EMG diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, low voltage
Sharp waves, occasional, left posterior quadrant
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because of abundant EMG artifacts. This is an abnormal
EEG due to 1) continuous focal slowing in the left hemispheric region.  This finding is indicative of
severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.  2) occasional epileptiform
discharges in the left posterior quadrant. These findings are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic focus in this region.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG artifact.  If clinically
