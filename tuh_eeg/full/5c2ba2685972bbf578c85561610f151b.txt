CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old male with epilepsy, seizures began at age 15, a total of 5-10 seizures in his lifetime. Most recent seizures October 2014. History of alcohol-related neuropathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Neurontin, hydrocodone, mirtazapine, Benadryl, sertraline, lisinopril, simvastatin, hydroxyz pam.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were below 5 kilo-ohms.  The patient was nervous, had difficulty relaxing with tightening of the jaw and frequent eye movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. There is a small amount of theta and a small amount of background disorganization.  Slightly asynchronous eye movements were noted by the technologist during this study and electrode placement was confirmed, but eye movements remained asynchronous.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of background slowing.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep and did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to,
Excess theta.
Mild disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a second EEG for this subject without epileptiform activity.  The background theta and disorganization may be related to this patient's medications, history or other causes.  In both studies, the patient had great difficulty relaxing.
