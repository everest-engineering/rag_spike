History:	28 YR MALE WITH A SZ IN 2008, 2009.  EEG TO GET DRIVERS LICENSE BACK.
.PMHX: BOXER.


Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:


None


Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,  10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Hr was 66

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Please note this is different from the previous EEG read on 04/13/2009 which revealed left anterior temporal slow and rare sharp waves.
