History:	27 year old woman with reported convulsions.  She is currently 8 months pregnant.
Her events increased during pregnancy.
Of note, patient has a history of prior MI and anemia.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is observed.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep is captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 23-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
