CLINICAL HISTORY:	22 year old female with multiple overdoses of oxycodone, Seroquel, and benzodiazepines with episodes of tremulousness, history of lung transplant.

MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Xanax, Gengraf, Prednisone,  Metoprolol, Norvasc, Folic
Acid, Heparin, Pantoprazole,  Cardizem, Lorazepam


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a technically, very challenging, EEG due to the fact that tactile stimulation of the patient produces tremor. In addition, the patient has multiple scalp attachments, including a hair weave.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is cerebral activity, which includes some delta activity, likely some theta and some beta.  The EEG, however, is greatly obscured by muscle artifact.

HR:	126 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Background slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study supports a significant, underlying encephalopathy.  Of concern, the severity of the background slowing may not be completely evaluated due to the limitations described above.  Follow up imaging and/or repeat study after her weaves and extensions have been cut out may be required.
