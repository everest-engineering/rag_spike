CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed man with history of head trauma and seizures when he was 16 years old.  Presented to the ER after being attacked with a possible seizure in October.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and a single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures:  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen independently at T4 and T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral, independent, mid temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral independent mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
