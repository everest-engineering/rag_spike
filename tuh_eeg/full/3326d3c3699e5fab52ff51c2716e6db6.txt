History:	62 yr male with cc of dizziness lightheaded fall with localized seizures.  per team pt
not waking up.  for eeg pt agitated uncooperative.  pt with heart issues, kidney,
peripheral vas, ds
Medications:	Dilantin, Lorazepam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 12.5 hours from 01/09/2014 to 01/10/2014.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of
the EEG was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
