CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 64-year-old male admitted with hyperglycemia, patient had occipital recurrent seizures, now with no additional seizures, but obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, acyclovir, cefepime, Norvasc, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with lower voltage theta, delta, and frontally predominant triphasic waves.  Tactile stimulation of the patient may blunt the triphasic waves a bit.  The overall background is relatively symmetric with a mixture of theta delta and then the triphasic waves, which do demonstrate some shifting asymmetries as well as an anterior to posterior lag.
Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.  Coughing appeared to be the most effective stimuli.  Following coughing, there are some sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including C3.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Triphasic waves with a relatively characteristic anterior to posterior lag.
Rare left central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded for this individual in this EEG.  The overall background is significantly different from previous studies and that there are more prominent triphasic waves.  No occipital seizures were recorded.  These findings may be correlated with clinical history.
