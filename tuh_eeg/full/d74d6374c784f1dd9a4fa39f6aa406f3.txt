REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old man with an increase in seizures.  He says that he has had 2 seizures in the last month, cannot explain if he had priors, but has had generalized tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At one point, there was an A2 and FP1 electrical artifact which was fixed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a nice well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is responsive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges. Sleep:  The patient went into sleep, stage I and stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
Heart rate 60.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
