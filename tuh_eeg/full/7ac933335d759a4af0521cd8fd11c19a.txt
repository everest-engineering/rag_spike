History:	40 year old man with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity.  A brief epoch of
waveforms seen during typical REM sleep is captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
premature QRS complexes, QRS complexes that change appearance and occasional up to 1.5
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A brief epoch that could represent
REM sleep is captured.  REM sleep is not typically seen in a spot/ routine EEG - please correlate
with an underlying sleep disorder.  A single EKG lead demonstrates premature QRS complexes,
QRS complexes that change appearance and occasional up to 1.5 second inter-QRS pauses.
