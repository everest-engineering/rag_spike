CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed male with cervical stenosis at C3, C4,

stroke, and depression. Evaluate for encephalopathy and spasms.

MEDICATIONS: Plavix, ASA, Metformin, Glipizide, Sertraline, Zocor, Furosemide,

ISOSORBIDE, Gabapentin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was performed.

This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm but

there is a small amount of slower 8 Hz activity in the background. In the transition to

drowsiness, occasional arrhythmic delta activity is picked up in the left temporal region.

There is a small amount of shifting slowing. Features of drowsiness also include some
bursts of frontal delta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving response.

HR: 66bpm

IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:

I. Arrhythmic delta activity in the left temporal region, greater than expected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Given the
patient's age, these findings are relatively modest.
