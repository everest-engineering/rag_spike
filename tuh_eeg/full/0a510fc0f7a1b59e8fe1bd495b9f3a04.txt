History:	77 YO FEMALE WITH RIGHT SIDE STROKE 10 MONTHS AGO AND SZ WITH LOC
LASTING A FEW MINUTES JUST 2 WEEKS AGO. PT HAS LEFT ARM AND LEG
PARALYSIS. PT HAD PACEMAKER 2YRS PRIOR, HEART BYPASS 6 YRS PRIOR
Medications:	PROTONIX, LIDODERM, KEPPRA, APRESOLINE, ZESTRIL, XARELTO,
LOPRESSOR, CARDIZEM, NEURONTIN, PROVIGIL, SENNA-DOCUSATE,
TYLENOL, COLACE, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-
75uV, 6-7Hz activity.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity and attenuation is present in the right hemisphere, maximal
in the anterior temporal region.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left
midtemporal region. At times this is sharply contoured and becomes monomorphic but is not clearly
epileptiform.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 108
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior, decreased amplitude
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, anterior, at times monomorphic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL one hour  awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in
the right hemisphere, maximal in the anterior temporal region.  This finding is consistent with the
known stroke. In addition, there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region and
diffuse slowing.  These findings are indicative of focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which are
etiologically non-specific.
