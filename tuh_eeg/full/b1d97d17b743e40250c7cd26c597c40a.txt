CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 40-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, seizure free for the last 7 months.  Seizures described as tongue biting with loss of consciousness and 10-15 minutes of confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Neurontin, which the patient may have stopped taking 3 months ago.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 30-50 microvolts.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta noted.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with the appearance of rhythmic theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation activated the record.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.  Awake and drowsy.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  There are no previous EEGs for comparison, but to more fully characterize her epilepsy, a follow-up study may be of value.
