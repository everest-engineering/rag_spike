CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old left handed woman with epilepsy, syncope, seizure free for 3 years.  Seizures characterized by left sided shaking with loss of consciousness and then generalized convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Frequent eye blink artifact is observed. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Sleep was not achieved.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Epileptiform activity was identified in this patient in 2004, but not in the 2 EEGs that follow.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
