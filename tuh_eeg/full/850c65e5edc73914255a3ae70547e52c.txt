CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old male who had a loss of consciousness while waiting for the bus on 03/19/2013.  He does not recall chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, or seizure like activity, poor historian.  Past history of anemia, seizures, hearing loss, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, atorvastatin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake, but somewhat confused, patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized, but is slow with a 7 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
As the patient becomes drowsy, there is attenuation of the beta frequency activity, followed by vertex waves.  There are a handful of isolated bursts of theta or delta from the left or right.
The technologist performs testing to confirm an alert state.  A 7 Hz mu rhythm was noted.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  54 to 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Arrhythmically slow background.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The findings described above are nonspecific and support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, which could be seen in the context of a dementing illness, medication effect, or other diffuse disturbances of cerebral function.  At this time there are no previous EEGs for comparison.
