History:	82 YR MALE  WITH LEFT BG STROKE IN 2009. S/P AVR 3 DAYS AGO AND
STILL NOT WAKING UP. PMHX:AORTIC STENOSIS, MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE,
HTN, BPH, CVA
Medications:	LEVODOPA, HYDRALAZINE, HEPARIN, INSULIN, FAMOTIDINE, RIVASTIGMINE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 6Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some normal stages I and II sleep architecture is seen intermittently.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region, at times this was sharply contoured but was not clearly epileptogenic.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, bilateral diffuse Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent left midtemporal focal slowing and diffuse background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
