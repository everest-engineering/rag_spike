CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 22-year-old woman with depression and sickle cell trait with reported epilepsy since October 2013 with sudden onset numbness arm, leg, and face, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat disorganized for an adult of this age.  During some portions of the waking record, the posterior dominant rhythm is 8 hertz, in later sections it reaches 9.7 hertz.  There is excess background theta, a small amount of disorganization, and a subtle asymmetry.  There is a bit more irregular theta-delta in the left hemisphere relevant to the right.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the findings in the left hemisphere.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
Heart rate 108 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm in apparent wakefulness.
A subtle asymmetry with subtle focal features on the left, accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Additional EEG assessment may be important for this young adult with recent epilepsy diagnosis.
