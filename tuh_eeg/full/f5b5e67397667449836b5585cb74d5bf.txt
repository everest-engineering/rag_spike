CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed male with history of CHF, hepatitis C, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, prostate cancer, who presents with complaints of seizures described as something over his shoulder that is always there after being hit by a moving vehicle.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Metoclopramide, Topiramate, Oxybutynin, Chloride, Baclofen.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which appears to have reactivity to eye opening.  There is slight decrease in the frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.
Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Bursts of anteriorly predominant 2-4 Hz polymorphic delta seen frequently at times with intermixed sharply contoured discharges.
Focal sharp waves seen in the frontal regions, mainly in the F4 electrode.  At times attenuated by the delta.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral frontal slowing.
Sharp waves with a right frontal predilection.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal region, as well as generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
