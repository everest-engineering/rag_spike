History:	50 YO MALE WITH LOC WHILE TALKING TO MOTHER ON 6/5/2014. HE AWOKE
IN HOSPITAL. PT POOR HISTORIAN, DOES NOT KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS
UNCONSCIOUS. FOLLOW UP EEG.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Intermittent, independent polymorphic delta activity is present in the  bilateral midtemporal regions
(left greater than right) during wakefulness, increasing during hyperventilation.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates the focal
slowing in the bilateral midtemporal regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces symmetric photic.  HR 54, irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to mild, intermittent, independent bilateral
midtemporal focal slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild focal
cerebral dysfunction in those regions.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was
not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
