Medications:	DILANTIN, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR-
66bpm  Technical limitations: please note there is a continuous myogenic artifact throughout the
temporal and frontal regions.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a technically limited normal EEG, awake, drowsy. Please note that due to the myogenic
artifact, an underlying abnormality could have been missed. If clinical question remains, please
repeat EEG with some sedation.
