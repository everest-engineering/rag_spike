History:	53 year old male with history of seizures.

There is a scar in the C3/P3 electrode area.
Medications:	Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha rhythm is frequently present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
There is continuous polymorphic sharply contoured delta activity present only in C3 electrode,
representing electrode artifact vs very focal slowing.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Other, C3 electrode artifact vs very focal slowing
Sleep, stage 2
Alpha variant, fast
Interpretation:
This is a likely NORMAL awake and asleep 26-minute EEG. Continuous polymorphic delta activity
that is observed only in C3 electrode likely represents C3 electrode artifact rather than focal
slowing, given very focal nature of the finding.  A repeat study would be of benefit to differentiate
between those two possibilities.
