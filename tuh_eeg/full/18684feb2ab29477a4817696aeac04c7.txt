History:	70 YO FEMALE WITH INCREASED WORSENING LEFT SIDE WEAKNESS, AND
NUMBNESS FOR 2 WEEKS. PT NEVER HAD SYMPTOMS BEFORE. PMHX: HTN,
CAD, HLD, GERD, DEPRESSION, SEASONAL ALLERGIES, T2OM ?
Medications:	Heparin, Insulin, ASA, Prozac, Dexamethasone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 10Hz alpha rhythm, well-formed in left occipital region
which attenuates with eye opening.  There is hemispheric asymmetry characterized by continuous
polymorphic delta activity in the right hemisphere (2-2.5Hz in frequency) , most pronounced in
temporal and parietal regions.  Diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  No sleep architecture is present during this recording.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere,
most pronounced in temporal and parietal regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Diffuse
beta activity could be due to medication effect.
