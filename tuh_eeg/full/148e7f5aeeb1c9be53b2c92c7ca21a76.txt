History:	23 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O REPORTED EVENTS OF
UNRESPONSIVENESS AND SZ ( ONSET 4/12)  FOUND TO BE ANEMIC, FEBRILE.
POSTICTAL/LETHARGY THAT LAST SEVERAL DAYS.
Medications:	Keppra, Vancomycin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontocentral and temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient was able to follow some
commands during recording.  HR was 35-40 BPM.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, other
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right central
Artifact, EMG, Bradycardia
Attenuation, continuous diffuse, diffuse scalp swelling
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and attenuation and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Diffuse attenuation could be due to generalized cortical dysfunction or fluid collection
in the extra axial or subclavian space.  intermittent focal slowing in the right frontocentral region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin.  Clinical correlation is recommended. Please note that the patient is
bradycardic.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG and ICU artifact.  If clinically indicated,
