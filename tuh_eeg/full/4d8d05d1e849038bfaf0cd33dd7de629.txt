History:	73 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX HTN, DM, DEPRESSION.  CC: SLURRED SPEECH,
CHANGE IN MS
Medications:	ASA, Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The waking background is disorganized but an alpha rhythm that reaches at best 7.5Hz can be seen
in limited wakefulness.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and mainly theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Frequent brief
(2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the
recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  No normal sleep architecture was present but
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  There
was reactivity to auditory stimuli.  HR was 86.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate diffuse
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The presence of FIRDA may signify raised ICP or non-specific diffuse cerebral
