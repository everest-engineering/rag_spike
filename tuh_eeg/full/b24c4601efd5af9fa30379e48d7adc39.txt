CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old male with Morquio syndrome, aseptic necrosis of the hip, facial droop.  Reevaluate for seizure versus stroke.  The patient recently hospitalized for left facial droop, now with stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is a primarily drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background from the left hemisphere is medium amplitude with a mixture of theta and delta.  When the patient arouses, there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm.  Continuous focal delta was noted from the right hemisphere, maximum in the right temporal region.  Through much of the record, the patient is somewhat drowsy, but when maximally awake, the pattern on the left is within normal limits.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This tracing differs from a previous study 01/28/2015.  It now demonstrates focal features in the right hemisphere, which may be correlated with imaging.
