Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:


TOPAMAX,  KEPPRA


Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Limited wakefulness reveals a waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR was 66

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. No clinical or electrographic seizures are  present.
