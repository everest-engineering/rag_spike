CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, currently
seizure free since 2000. Typical seizures included confusion lasting one-half hour to 1
hour.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol, Lamictal, Zyprexa, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient seems to be very
sleep. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage. The left
hemisphere demonstrates more of a lower voltage beta pattern with a difficult to discern
alpha rhythm. The right hemisphere is more low voltage beta and some subtle rhythmic
theta delta activity including 4 Hertz theta and 1-2 Hertz delta. Features of drowsiness
included increase in beta and on rare occasions a few broadly contoured right anterior
temporal sharp waves. This is really primarily sharply contoured delta. Hyperventilation
does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intra hemispheric asymmetry with slowing of the right hemisphere which includes
increased delta and theta and decreased alpha and beta.
2. Sharply contoured delta from the right.
3. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to his most recent study in
2005. Correlation with imaging is advised.
