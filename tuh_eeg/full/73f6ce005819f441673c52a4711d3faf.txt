History:	47 year old man found unresponsive.
Medications:	Keppra, (In ED Fentanyl, Narcan, Ativan)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, obtunded
Description:
During very brief drowsiness 12 Hz activity is seen posteriorly without normal AP gradient.  The
background during drowsiness consists primarily of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity
with underriding excess beta activity.  Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the recording.
During sleep the background consists of diffusely attenuated background with frequent diffuse
spindle-like bursts of activity.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
No electrographic seizures
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL briefly awake and mostly asleep 21-minute EEG due to diffuse background
slowing. This finding is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific,
but at least partially related to the medication effect.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
