History:	58 YR OLD MALE PRESENTED ON 1/9 WITH H/O HYPOTENSION. POST LIVER
BIOPSY ON 1/10 PT CODED X 2 PEA FOR 20 MIN W/ EACH EPISODE. NEURO
CLL'D PT NOT WAKING UP. PT NOW AWAKE AND FOLLOWING COMMANDS
Medications:	NOREPINEPHRINE, BUMETANIDE, EPINEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm was at best 7.5 Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
mainly theta activity with some delta and an anterior alpha could be seen intermittently.
Intermittent bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal polymorphic and at times more monomorphic
delta is seen in wakefulness. They do not evolve in frequency.  There is variability and reactivity in
the background.  Some sleep is captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing .  This finding is
indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
