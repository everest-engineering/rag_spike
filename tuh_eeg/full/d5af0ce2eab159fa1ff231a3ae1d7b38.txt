History:	81 YO FEMALE W/ FATIGUE DIZZINESS FOR SEVERAL DAYS.
STOOL W/ NAUSEA FOR 2 DAYS AND DECREASED PO INTAKE FOR 4 WKS.
EPIGASTRIC PAIN, HEARTBURN, AND OCCASIONAL HAS, CP, SOB, W/
Medications:	Pantoprazole, Tramadol, Acetaminophen
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic independent bitemporal focal slowing (T6, T4, and T7) is present during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 90 bpm and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, independently
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent independent focal slowing
in the bitemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No electrographic seizures are present.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
