CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed female status post colon stent as well as history of rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, asthma, migraines. and depression who presents with severe headaches after hemorrhage, now continued headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax. Metyrosine, Folic Acid, Suma, Synthroid, ASA, Actemra
REASON FOR STUDY: Headaches after stent.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes. The patient's EEG was performed-during wakefulness and stage I sleep. Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. Wakefulness and sleep stage I were recorded. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: None.

SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. A prolonged repeated recording with deeper stages of sleep may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
