CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old right handed woman with 2 strokes, 3 seizures, diabetes, epilepsy, amputation, CML.  Past history of right occipital and left frontal temporal infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Nifedipine, Insulin, Metoprolol, Imatinib, Darbepoetin, ASA, Atorvastatin, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Some sections of the record are pretty well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is generous beta, some underlying theta, and occasional shifting arrhythmic delta. Spindles, vertex waves, and POSTS are noted in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling off to sleep and does activate the record.  The sleep record is relatively symmetric.  There is shifting slowing.
HR:    90 bpm, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional shifting slowing.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG.  None of the EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  The excess theta and shifting slowing may be due to her other medical problems.
