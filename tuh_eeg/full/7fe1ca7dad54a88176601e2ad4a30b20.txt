CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old woman, status post right hemispheric stroke with seizures perhaps for the last 4 years, recurrent episodes of confusion.  Incomplete control with seizure medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Klonopin, Ativan, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The overall background is somewhat disorganized.  There is some shifting slowing, but there is a bit more consistent, underlying focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, maximum in the mid temporal to central temporal region.  Although there are bursts of shifting slowing, there are subtle underlying sharp waves, discernable maximum at T4.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Underlying subtle focal features in the right temporal region including right temporal sharp waves and associated focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to 2 previous studies, although sharp waves are not as prominent as they were in 2011.  EEG monitoring for this patient will more completely characterize confusional spells and epileptiform activity.
