CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old female transplant patient with history of multiple metabolic problems and depression, now with tremulousness and jerking.
MEDICATION:  Dilaudid, Insulin, Benadryl, Cellcept, Seroquel, Prograf, Nystatin, Valcyte, Prednisone, Protonix, Lopressor, Acetylcysteine, Bactrim, ASA, Nicotine Patch
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is a relatively higher voltage pattern.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 to 7.5 Hz and a pattern with rhythmic theta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing.  Brief arousals produce a lower voltage pattern and there are sections of the record with a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. The patient has occasional muscle jerk artifact which is not associated with a change in the EEG. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:    108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent, arrhythmic slowing.
Occasional bursts of rhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG has characteristics of a metabolic pattern.  No epileptiform features were noted.  The improvement of the background with stimulation, again, is most supportive of a metabolic process.
