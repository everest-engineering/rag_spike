CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old male with short stature, macrocephaly, on phenytoin for many years, seizure free for perhaps 25 years, and recently admitted to outside hospital with Dilantin toxicity.
MEDICATIONS:  Multiple medications, phenytoin on hold.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a 40-minute EEG.  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The overall background is somewhat poorly organized.  There is a shift in rhythmic delta activity, a bit more so on the right posterior quadrant.  Prominent shifting slowing is noted in drowsiness.  In this somewhat sharply contoured record, there is a left temporal sharp waves and some sharply contoured theta in the right temporal region.
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of shifting, sharply contoured mixed theta delta.
Broadly contoured left temporal sharp waves.
Background disorganization
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  Overall, this EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function with sharply contoured activity from either hemisphere, but more well defined sharp waves from the left.
