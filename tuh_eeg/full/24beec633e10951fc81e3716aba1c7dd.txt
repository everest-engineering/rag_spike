History:	66 YO FEMALE WITH PACE MAKER, ESSENTIAL TREMOR, HTN, HIGH CHOL NO
DM, HAD RECENT SYNCOPAL EPISODE W/O PRESYNCOPE. PT LOC, FELL
DOWN STAIRS.
Medications:	Patient reported no meds.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess theta activity, 7 Hz in frequency, during wakefulness.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 65.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
