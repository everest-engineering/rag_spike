DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness including increasing beta.  Brief stage II sleep is observed followed by spontaneous arousals.  Hyperventilation produces an increasing amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep and does elicit scant driving.
