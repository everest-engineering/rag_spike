CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old gentleman with GBM, resected last year.  New onset seizures, multiple seizures today followed by confusion and agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Haldol, Keppra, MS-Contin, Tramadol, Glipizide
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is quite somnolent but is no longer aggressive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a slow background.  There is focal slowing from the left hemisphere with arrhythmic delta activity, most prominent in the left temporal region.  There is the suggestion of a breach rhythm.  A left temporal spike, maximum at T3 with amplitudes exceeding 70 microvolts is noted.  Some of the spikes are low voltage, others higher voltage.  Some of them are complex with a polyphasic component.  The field of spread in the after-going slowing includes the left centrotemporal region.  This could be considered a PLEDS plus discharge with waxing and waning of the activity.  Stimulation of the patient seems to be associated with a reduction of the epileptiform activity.  Stimulation of the patient unfortunately also produces a great deal of muscle artifact.
HR:    108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Periodic sharp waves in the left temporal region with a PLEDS plus pattern.
Left temporal focal slowing.
A breach rhythm on the left.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic focus.  Ongoing EEG recording was requested.
