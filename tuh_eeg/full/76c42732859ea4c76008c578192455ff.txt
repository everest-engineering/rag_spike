History:	85 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF CVA 4/14. RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS. DM, HTN, PRESENTS WITH EPISODE OF SYNCOPE. PT FELT TIRED/WARM THEN EYES ROLLED BACK UE SHAKING LAST 10 MIN. POST CONFUSION
Medications:	NO SEDATION/ SZ MEDS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid-temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 72 irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Alpha rhythm, slow
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  In addition, there is mild  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
