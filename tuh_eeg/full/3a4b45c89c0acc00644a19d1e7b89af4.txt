REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of syncope versus seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old man with episodes of loss of consciousness, syncope versus seizures, with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Nifedical, aspirin, simvastatin, losartan, hydrochlorothiazide.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  One single T4 electrode artifact occurred for 5 seconds throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures  including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
HEART RATE:  60.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
