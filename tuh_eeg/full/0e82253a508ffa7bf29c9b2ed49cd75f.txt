LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 43-year-old man who presents with a history of syncope with associated chest pain.  Prior to the event the patient felt lightheaded and dizzy.  There was positive loss of consciousness and shaking.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, oxycodone, Dilaudid, lorazepam, Protonix, Xanax, and Lovenox.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 Hz activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is present, but weak.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present throughout the recording.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving multiple flash frequencies.  A paced cardiac rhythm is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild disorganization.
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG due to mild background disorganization.  This findings indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
