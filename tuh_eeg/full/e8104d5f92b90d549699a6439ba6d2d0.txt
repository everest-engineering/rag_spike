DATE OF STUDY:  March 6 through March 7, 2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old with repair of tetralogy of Fallot at age 6, stroke as a young adult with refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Depakote, Keppra, LEV, VPD, CBZ
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient continued to report episodes of left hemibody tremulousness around 8:00 p.m. and around midnight.  Once again he reported that he definitely touched the button, although no pushbuttons for a seizure could be identified.  In addition, multiple practice pushbuttons by the medical staff were noted around those times.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG remains attenuated on the right.  There are bursts of sharply contoured slowing from the left or right.  In wakefulness a new rhythm is identified on the left.
This section of the record is remarkable for more significant, well-defined right  mid temporal sharp waves.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during sections of the record once again failed to identify definitive electrographic seizures.  Once again, bursts of rhythmic left temporal theta were noted particularly at 8:48 p.m., but without clinical signs or symptoms, and those bursts were without frequency evolution.
