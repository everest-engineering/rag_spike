History:	57 year old man who has a history of IGE.
Medications:	Dilantin and Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of 11 Hz low-to-moderate amplitude
alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Runs of diffuse monomorphic ~7.5 Hz diffuse theta activity
are noted when patient's eyes are closed.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
On three occasions generalized frontally predominant low amplitude polyspikes followed by high
amplitude slow waves are captured.  Twice these discharges occur with a repetition rate of ~ 3.5 Hz
(burst last ~ 0.5 seconds) and are followed by brief (~1-1.5 seconds) of diffuse frontally predominant
moderate-to-high amplitude delta activity.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Polyspike-and-wave complexes, few, at ~ 3.5 Hz
No electrographic seizures
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 27-minute EEG due to fast (~3.5 Hz) polyspike-and-wave
discharges. In the proper clinical context, the presence of these discharges suggests the diagnosis of
Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy.
