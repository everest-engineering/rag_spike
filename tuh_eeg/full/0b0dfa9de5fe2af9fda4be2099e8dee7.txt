CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed woman who presents with history of stroke, hypertension, heart attack, diabetes, Bell palsy in 2006 on occipital axis, presents with slurred speech and right facial droop.
MEDICATIONS:  Pravastatin, Aspirin, Plavix, Lantus.
REASON FOR EEG:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8.5 Hz and is best seen over the right hemisphere.  Some normal frontocentral beta is seen over the right hemisphere and with a slight decreased amplitude over the left.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 continuously at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 mV.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen almost continuously.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with a known stroke in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
