History:	42 YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH SEIZURES AS THE RESULT OF TAKING
TRAMADOL. PATIENT WAS HIT BY A TRUCK 1/20/2014 AND HAD MULTIPLE
Medications:	XANAX, PERCOCET, ROBITUSSIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 80.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Beta diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
