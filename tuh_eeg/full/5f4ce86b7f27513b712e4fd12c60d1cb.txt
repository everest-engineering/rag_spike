Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the temporal regions during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent frontally-maximal, spike-and-wave discharges that could
represent fragments of generalized spike and wave.  However at times the discharges appear to have
a slight right hemisphere amplitude predominance and may represent focal discharges with a
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Spikes
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent frontally-maximal, spike-and-
wave discharges that could represent fragments of generalized spike and wave or focal discharges
with rapid secondary synchrony. This findings are supportive of a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The
intermittent temporal slowing supports focal temporal cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific
with regards to etiology.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
