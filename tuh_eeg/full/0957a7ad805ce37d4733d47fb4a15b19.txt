CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with a long history of refractory complex partial epilepsy, day 2 of continuous video EEG monitoring.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG, T1-T2 electrodes and seizure and spike detection.  The patient reported occasional accidental push button detections.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of 7 Hz theta, less than noted on previous occasions.  Stage 1 sleep includes POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep includes spindles, which are slightly asymmetric.
Seizures:  None.
Push button detections:  Only accidental push buttons, no epileptiform seizures.
Interictal epileptiform activity:  In sleep, nearly continuous left temporal sharp waves and spikes are noted.  These are marked and include 10:53:59 in the morning.  They may occur with TIRDA and transient sharp waves and spikes.  The video was reviewed during sleep with these events.  No behavioral signs or symptoms are noted.
On the morning of the 3rd, the patient is eating and chewing.  He does seem to have a little bit of underlying theta in the left temporal region, the first time this may have been noted in wakefulness, however, the EEG is obscured by chewing artifact.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Day two of continuous EEG monitoring demonstrates prominent left temporal epileptiform activity in sleep, but no clinical seizures and no sustained epileptiform discharges in wakefulness.
