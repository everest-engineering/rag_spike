CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old woman with an 18 month history of left-sided headaches, numbness, dizziness, and involuntary jerking in her sleep for the last 6 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Valtrex, Zofran, Antivert, Synthroid, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  No clinical events were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of drowsiness with the appearance of rhythmic theta and generous beta.  Hypnagogic hypersynchrony was noted with prominent, paroxysmal theta.  In the transition to sleep, in addition to hypnagogic hypersynchrony, there are 1-2 paroxysmal bursts which have slight asynchrony.  These are noted just as the patient transitions into stage 2 sleep.  With review with average reference, however the bursts are actually synchronous.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta but the patient seemed to be falling asleep during hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This electroencephalogram is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient appears to have prominent hypnagogic hypersynchrony, which is symmetric when reviewed carefully. This is a normal variant. If there are additional questions, additional EEG monitoring or additional sleep recording may be of value to characterize the myoclonus.
