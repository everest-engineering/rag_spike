CLINICAL HISTORY:  31 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, past history of alcohol abuse.  Typical seizure occurred 10 days ago with lightheadedness, head filling up with air, loss of consciousness, and then confusion.  This is an outpatient EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Serax, Phenobarbital, Clonidine, Tigan

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage, but with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, generous beta, and some 5 Hz muscle artifact.  The EEG would suggest that the patient may be somewhat edgy with beta activity and muscle artifact.  She is a bit more relaxed in the final minutes of the EEG when the beta activity drops out. Features of drowsiness include a drop out of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation produces primarily movement artifact. Despite a fair amount of muscle artifact, photic stimulation does elicit scant driving. The beta and muscle artifact can be seen in an anxious individual.

HR:   100 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  To more completely characterize this patient's seizures, a follow up EEG is suggested.
