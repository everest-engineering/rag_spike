Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for19 hours from 05/12/2014 to 05/13/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Patient had an episode of mouth chattering and crying, while able to respond to some commands.
This would start and stop intermittently. The episode lasted 12 minutes. The EEG background
during the event was normal.
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Infrequent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in  the bilateral midtemporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake and drowsy EEG for age. The episode described above had no EEG
correlate and along with the clinical presentation it is consistent with psychogenic non-epileptic
