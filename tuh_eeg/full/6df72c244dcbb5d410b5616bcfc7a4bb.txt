AGE: 73 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 10/16/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1531
HISTORY:
73 y.o. female with a history of head trauma, craniotomy, right frontal brain injury in 2012 referred for routine EEG for epilepsy evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 20 mg capsule, TAKE 1 CAPSULE BY MOUTH DAILY.
gemfibrozil (LOPID) 600 mg tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH 2 TIMES DAILY (BEFORE MEALS) .
aspirin 81 mg EC tablet, TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH DAILY. SPIRIVA WITH HANDIHALER 18 mcg inhalation capsule, INHALE 1 CAPSULE INTO THE LUNGS DAILY.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is a low voltage, symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.	There is a slight accentuation of amplitude in the right hemisphere.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There was no Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 104 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.	The amplitude asymmetry is a normal finding after craniotomy.
