CLINICAL HISTORY:   56 year old right handed male with pulmonary sarcoid who presented on the 7th with a first ever seizure.  Found lethargic followed by generalized shaking, tongue biting and incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Although the patient appears to be very drowsy, in maximal wakefulness, this is a low voltage and quite slow EEG with a glimpse of a 7 to 8 Hz alpha rhythm but much of the time is slower alpha rhythm.  The patient is drifting off to sleep in hyperventilation.  In early drowsiness this is a low voltage, markedly slow pattern with a mixture of delta and 4 Hz theta.  Slightly asynchronous vertex waves were noted in stage II sleep but spindles were relatively symmetric. Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
HR:    78 bpm with frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Somewhat asynchronous vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's hypersomnolence may be correlated with clinical features.  The, at times, relatively significant background slowing in an awake patient would be more supportive of a chronic encephalopathy than an acute encephalopathy.  No epileptiform features were observed.
