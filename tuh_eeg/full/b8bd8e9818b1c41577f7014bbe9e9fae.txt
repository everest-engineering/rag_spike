CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old male right handed with MR, agitation and violent
behavior. Epilepsy, onset 2 years ago, with right hand shaking followed by generalized
tonic clonic activity for 1-3 minutes with postictal and aggressive behavior.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no photic stimulation or
hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffuse 5 Hz
theta pattern. There is a small amount of arrhythmic delta activity in the right temporal
region with rare right anterior temporal sharp waves. A single C3 sharp wave is
observed.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffuse theta background.
2. Sharply contoured slowing and rare sharp waves in the right anterior temporal
region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The theta pattern supports a diffuse disturbance of brain
function. The right temporal sharp waves suggest a focal mechanism for seizures.
