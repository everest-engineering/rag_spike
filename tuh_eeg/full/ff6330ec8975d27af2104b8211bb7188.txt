CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old male admitted with HHNK and then became
unresponsive, had a seizure in the emergency room on 12/10/2009.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Fentanyl, Vancomycin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It is a
slow, low voltage, mixed frequency pattern with some featureless delta, .theta and
smaller amounts of beta. In this low voltage record, there is subtle focal slowing in the
right central temporal region. There are bursts of beta which are higher amplitude on the
right compared to the left and there is an underlying sharp wave at T 4-C4 with
involvement of T2. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster flash
frequencies. There is some variability in the record.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked slow background.
2. Intermittent bursts of beta.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. Some of the features described above may be due to this patient's sedative
hypnotic medications. The focal sharp waves support a localization related mechanism
for epilepsy despite the history of severe metabolic findings. Additional EEG monitoring
may be appropriate if the patient is more obtunded than anticipated.
