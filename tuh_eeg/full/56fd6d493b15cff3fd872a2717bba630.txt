CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old male with past history of tonic-clonic seizures, stroke, and alcohol abuse.  No seizures reported since 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage with an alpha rhythm of 8.3 Hz.  The overall background has excess theta at times of 6-7 Hz.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta followed by vertex waves.  The patient transitions in and out of lighter stages of sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation was completed as the patient was drifting in and out of sleep and elicited a scant driving response.
Heart rate:  60 BMP.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Excess background theta.
This is the third EEG for this patient.  All studies have demonstrated background slowing, although today's may demonstrate less than the most recent 2011 study.  None of the EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Clinical correlation in regard to evidence of the cognitive impairment may be of value.
