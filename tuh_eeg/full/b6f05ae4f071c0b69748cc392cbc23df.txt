CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old woman who was injured in a house fire May 17th.  The patient has had spells with either posturing or myoclonus.  Previous history of left craniotomy for subdural hematoma, on seizures medications, multiple sclerosis, and blindness.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Keppra, fentanyl, magnesium, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of delta and theta.  There is an overlying asymmetry with a breach rhythm on the left, congruent with the patient's past history of subdural hematoma and craniotomy.  Rare left temporal sharp waves were noted.
Heart rate 108 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
Occasional asymmetry with greater delta on the left.
Rare simple left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The sharp waves were in the region of the patient's craniotomy.  This patient's medications and critical illness as well
as her past neurological history may all contribute to the pattern described above.  No seizures were recorded.
