History:	52 year old woman who presents with cerebritis and recurrent seizures.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Versed drip (being weaned off)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 4/25/2014 till 4/26/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording the background consists of burst-suppression
pattern with burst-to-suppression ratio of ~ 1:1.  Bursts contain a mixture of frequencies.  As the
recording progresses, burst-suppression is replaced by attenuated background with frequent periods
of discontinuity and excess fast activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No seizures are noted.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Burst-suppression pattern, mild
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour continuous video EEG because of mild degree of burst-suppression
pattern and severe background slowing and attenuation by the end of the recording.  This finding is
indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this case at least partially related to the
medication effect (versed drip).  Change in the background is related to ongoing weaning of Versed
drip.  No electrographic seizures are present in the last 72 hours.  These findings were conveyed to
the primary team.
