CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year.old male with a seizure 3 months ago.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is the third EEG for this
individual. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the EEG is acceptably
organized for an adult of this age. There is a 9 Hz posterior rhythm in
wakefulness. In addition, there seems to be occipitally predominant 14 and 6 Hz activity
as well as central mu rhythm. This central mu activity is 8.5 Ht in frequency. Photic
stimulation is performed during a section of the record with a 1l4 and 6 activity present,
but there is a driving response.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The EEG today demonstrates a normal variant which is
called 14 and 6 as well as a central mu; 14 and 6 Hz activity can be seen in normals as
well as those with epilepsy. No epileptiform features were today and, in fact. in the 3
EEGs, only a single generalized spike in complex was ever identified.
