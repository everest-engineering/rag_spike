History:	22 YO FEMALE PMHX: W/ PEA IN FIELD. CRP + MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF EPI /
BICARB + CALCIUM AND NARCAN. ROSL AFTER SEVERAL ROUNDS. PMHX:
DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PTSD, ASTHMA, PANIC ATTACKS, HEP-C, DRUG
ABUSE, S/P ITD
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm is present.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies
is not seen.  There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal abnormalities.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  HR was 126  There was a continuous 60Hz
artifact in the EEG.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of This is a limited  isoelectric EEG.  This EEG is
consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death. Please note that the 60Hz artifact could not
be eliminated from the record and a notch filter needed to be used to interpret the record.
