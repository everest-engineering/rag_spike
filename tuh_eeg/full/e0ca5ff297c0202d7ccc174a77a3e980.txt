SCHIZOPHRENIA,HX OF RAPE AT YOUNG AGE , 2 C SECTIONS, NO H/O SZ55
CN HEAD
Medications:	Haldol
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Much of the record captures drowsiness or sleep.  There is
diffuse bihemispheric theta (5-6Hz) slowing intermittently throughout the recording even when the
patient is awake.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to vertex 2-4Hz activity.
There is subtle left frontal and temporal predominance of the background slowing.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to diffuse bihemispheric slowing and
focal left frontotemporal slowing. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and possible left sided structural brain injury.
