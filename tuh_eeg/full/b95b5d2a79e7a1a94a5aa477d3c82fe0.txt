History:	59-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and depression
Medications:	unknown
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep, Normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
