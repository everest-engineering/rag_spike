CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed gentleman with a long history of refractory epilepsy and past history of status epilepticus. History of left seizures with left-sided shaking and obtundation.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is very drowsy throughout much of the EEG with an increase in beta but there is at times an B Hertz alpha rhythm. In sleep, there are subtle focal slowing from the right temporal region and a few low voltage sharp waves. Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing from the right temporal region.
2. Subtle right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to this patient's multiple previous EEGs.
