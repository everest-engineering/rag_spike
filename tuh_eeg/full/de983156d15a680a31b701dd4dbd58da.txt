History:	75 YR OLD MALE WITH PRIOR EEG FOR LT CEA 2006, PRESENTS WITH
NOTED TREMOR OF HEAD AND NECK, EEG TO R/O SZ.// PT HAS PACEMAKER
Medications:	Unknown
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  There was a frequent muscle artifact from his tremor which resolved
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
