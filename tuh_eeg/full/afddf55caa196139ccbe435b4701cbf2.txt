CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old woman with history of posttraumatic epilepsy for 2 years, in her 30s.  Patient reported seizures with left-sided numbness and generalized tonic-clonic: involuntary movements with starring and poor responsiveness.  Past history of gastric bypass.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal, Actos, and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  This is a 26-minute routine, digital video EEG with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Abundant sleep was characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
