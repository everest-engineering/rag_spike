CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old gentleman with COPD, schizophrenia, chronic kidney disease with a history of polysubstance abuse.  The patient stopped drinking several months ago, but suffered recent, first ever seizure.
MEDICINES:  Keppra, risperidone, Vistaril, nicotine patch, albuterol, Bactrim.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with an 8-8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  POSTS are noted in stage 1 sleep with brief stage 2 sleep with spindles.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate:  78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
slightly slow alpha
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were observed.  This individual is noted to have somewhat disrupted stage 2 sleep, but satisfactory stage 2 sleep was captured in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The mildly slow alpha rhythm may be due to this patient's medications or neurocognitive disorder.
