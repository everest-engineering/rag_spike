CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy since age 26.
He did have 3 seizures last week, typically nocturnal seizures or focal seizures.
Typically he has several seizures, not more than 2 seizures, per year and may go 2
years without a seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Lamotrigine, Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm of
amplitude up to 60 microvolts. The alpha is a little higher amplitude on the left
compared to the right. There is a small amount of shifting arrhythmic delta activity and
a bit more on the left compared to the right. Features of drowsiness include
attenuation of the alpha rhythm. There is a bit of shifting asymmetry in the central
region with a question of a C3 vertex wave versus suboptimal head measurement.
Looking through the entire record the electrode measurement may be slightly off.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Temporal slowing with a bit of arrhythmic delta activity, left greater than right,
anticipated.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. These findings
may be correlated with this patient's history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, age,
and other.
