CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old male with newly recognized seizures.  Patient was found this morning after the family heard a noise, found him stiff with tonic-clonic seizures and then postictal confusion.  The patient was amnestic for the event.  The patient may have been having up to 3 tonic-clonic seizures not previously recognized by the family.
MEDICATIONS:  Prilosec, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  This was a technically satisfactory study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is generous low voltage, frontocentral beta.  There is excess theta noted in the background and there is some shifting, sharply contoured, somewhat irregular theta and delta noted from either hemisphere. In this sharply contoured record with a sharply contoured background, there is an underlying sharp wave noted at T4-T2, the right temporal region.
Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to
Background slowing and disorganization.
In this sharply contoured pattern, there is shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
Right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The team contacted the PMD to facilitated expeditious Neurology appointment for this patient and attempts are underway to contact this patient's attending physician with these findings. This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy and a bi-hemispheric process
