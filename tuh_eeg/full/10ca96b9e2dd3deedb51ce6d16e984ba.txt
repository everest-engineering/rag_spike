CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old male with recurrent syncope with left-sided numbness, alcohol abuse, hepatitis and anemia.

MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Atropine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an extremely well-organized, 10Hz 50 microvolt alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage (central beta) activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with attenuation of the alpha. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving.

HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a normal, healthy, vigorous pattern for an adult of this age. No epileptiform features were noted. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
