CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed man with history of epilepsy since 2005 with complex partial seizures and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, a past medical history of high cholesterol, depression and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zonisamide, Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 as well as infrequently at F8/T4 mainly during sleep.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left more than right anterior temporal sharp waves occurring occasionally.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal region.  No seizures were seen.
