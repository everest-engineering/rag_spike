LENGTH OF RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of seizures who now presents with a witnessed generalized tonic/clonic convulsion.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Lamictal and risperidone.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consist of low to moderate amplitude, 8 to 8-1/2 hertz activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at low amplitudes anteriorly. Diffuse excess beta is present.  During sleep there is increase in the amount of theta, frequently diffuse and semirhythmic.  Frequent 1-1-1/2 second burst of 3 hertz frontally predominant generalized spike in wave and polyspike in wave discharges captured.  At times they have left __________.  Frequency and duration of these discharges increases with photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation is produced with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background. __________ photic stimulation results in increase in frequency and duration of generalized spike in wave discharges.
FINDINGS:
Three hertz generalized frontally predominant spike in wave, polyspike in wave discharges.
Mild diffuse slowing.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This an abnormal awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and generalized 3 hertz spike in wave discharges.  Mild diffuse slowing indicates etiologic for nonspecific mild cerebral dysfunction.  Diffuse excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepine or barbiturates.  Generalized spike in wave discharges indicate generalized type of epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology team.
