11/18/14 FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	Keppra, Vimpat, Tacrolimus
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at higher voltages over the
left hemisphere.  The background over the right consists of well formed and modulated low-to-
moderate 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity posteriorly that attenuates with eyes opening and normal AP
gradient.  The background over the left consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8.5 Hz PDR
with absence AP gradient.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
Additional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left hemisphere with delta activity
especially prominent anteriorly.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, Maximal frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG due to continuous moderate focal slowing over the
lest hemisphere and, especially, over the left anterior region.  This finding is indicative of a focal
cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
