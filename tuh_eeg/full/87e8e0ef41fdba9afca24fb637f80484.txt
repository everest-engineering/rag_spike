History:	47 Y/O MAN WITH PMHX OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, MR, AND SZS.   DESCRIBED AS
SHAKING AND EYES ROLLING BACK. FOLLOW UP EEG LAST SZ X 1 WEEK
Medications:	CARBAMAZEPINE, LAMOTRIGINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Pt rapidly goes to sleep.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present. Please note there is a
short sleep latency which may be suggestive of a sleep disturbance.
