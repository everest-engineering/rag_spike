MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is performed. Photic stimulation is performed twice. Digital analysis of the background was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing as well as an increase in amplitude of the background. The patient is somewhat restless. Restless is associated with lambda activity. Photic
stimulation elicits a bilateral driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal 1 hour awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Unfortunately sleep was not achieved. This is the second normal EEG for this individual with frequent seizures.
