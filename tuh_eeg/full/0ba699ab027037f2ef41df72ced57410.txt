CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old male with multiple tonic-clonic seizures and blood glucose of 846.  Please evaluate for status epilepticus.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a low-voltage slow, relatively featureless pattern with intermittent, although somewhat higher paroxysmal mixed theta delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle.  Spontaneous arousals were noted.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The background slowing is compatible with the patient's clinical picture of a severe underlying encephalopathy.  The presence of reactivity and variability are positive prognostic finding.
