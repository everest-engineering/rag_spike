CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old woman who presented status post code for approximately 15 minutes due to a recent asthma attack.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, Lovenox, Mannitol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Electrocerebral sinus study.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while comatose and unresponsive.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low amplitude with no normal background, no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal cerebral activity seen or sleep architecture seen throughout the recording.  The technician attempts to stimulate the patient with no changes in the frequency.  The recording was performed using electrocerebral sinus with double distance electrodes and reviewed 2 microvolts per millimeter and there was no normal cerebral activity seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  No normal electrocerebral activity seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Electrocerebral silence.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals no normal electrical cerebral activity.  This is consistent with the appropriate hypoxic injury and in the setting of no sedative medications and appropriate body temperature would be suggestive of severe cerebral dysfunction or brain death.  Clinical correlation required.
