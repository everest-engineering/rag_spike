CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old male admitted last Sunday morning with repetitive seizures, history of multiple sclerosis, and cognitive impairment.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Lovenox, Keppra

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very slow pattern in an awake and drowsy adult. When the patient is awake, there is an increase in background muscle artifact. As he drifts off to sleep there is more of a theta delta pattern with occasional bursts of slowing from the left frontal central region.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the left frontal central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to a study performed earlier this week, no epileptiform features were noted.
