CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old woman with vertebrobasilar insufficiency, bilateral stroke syndrome.  Transient alternating right or left weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was on a face mask.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This EEG captured wakefulness and sleep. It was technically acceptable
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily a theta frequency background.  With stimulation, a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was noted.
The background is interrupted by intermittent bursts of relatively rhythmic slow delta, which are bilateral.  In addition, shifting, arrhythmic delta can be noted from either hemisphere.  At times, it is a bit more prominent in the right posterior region.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A somewhat slow and disorganized background.
Bursts of shifting, irregular slowing, at times a bit more arrhythmic or slowing in the right posterior region in comparison to the left.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric process.  The bursts of rhythmic delta may be attributed to the patient's brainstem process.  No epileptiform features were noted.  If needed, additional EEG recording may be helpful to assess cerebral function.
