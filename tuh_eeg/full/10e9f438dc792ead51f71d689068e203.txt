History:	17 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O NEW ONSET SZ ON 7/29/14
ECLAMPTIC SZ (LOC W/GEN SHAKING) PT STATES THAT SHE TOOK TYLENOL
HAD SZ CAME TO HOSPITAL FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS 8 1/2 MONTHS
PREGNANT.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta/ theta activity is present in the bilateral occipital region (at times
with a posterior temporal field) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces a mild symmetric photic driving response.  HR was 84.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral occipital
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bilateral occipital region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
