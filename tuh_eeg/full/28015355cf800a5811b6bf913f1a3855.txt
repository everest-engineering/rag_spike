CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old right handed woman admitted with acute shortness
of breath, COPD, asthma, and alcohol dependence. Evaluate for delirium.
MEDICATIONS: Bactrim, Heparin, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake and a bit
restless.
DESCRIPTION╖OF╖THE RECORD: The background EEG includes primarily rhythmic
5-Hz activity. There is a glimpse of a 9-Hz alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness
include smooth transition to frontal delta and attenuation of some of the faster frequency
activity. With stimulation, the patient easily alerts, and in fact when the patient is
examined during the EEG, a 9-Hz alpha rhythm returns. When left unstimulated, she
transitions to a slower pattern.
HR: 108 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Frontal irregular rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most suggestive of a metabolic
encephalopathy or a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. No epileptiform features
were identified.
