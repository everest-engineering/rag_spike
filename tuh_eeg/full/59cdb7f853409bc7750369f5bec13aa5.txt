CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male, critically ill with lupus, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation and intermittent jerking movements status post dialysis yesterday.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Decadron and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive with intermittent alterations in behavior.
Although, it was not marked in the EEG, the nurses reported to the technologist that during this 3 hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with more of an arrhythmic theta frequency pattern.  There is intermittent subtle attenuation and the overall background is the mixture of theta and delta.
Intermittent attenuations were noted.  There is reactivity of the EEG and variability in that some sections have more alpha frequency than others.
At 3 p.m., the nurse is observing the patient and tells the technologist that she sees the behavior in question.  Reviewing the torso, upper arms and face of the patient, no clinical or behavioral changes are noted, but there is an increase in muscle followed by an attenuation.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Significant generalized background slowing.
Intermittent attenuations.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were noted.  No focal or epileptiform features were observed.  The overall picture for this EEG is one of a severe underlying, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Overall, compared to the previous study, this EEG is significantly improved.  Triphasics are not seen and there is a better organized pattern.
