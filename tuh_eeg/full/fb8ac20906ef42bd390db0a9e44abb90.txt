MEDICINES:  Keppra, Depakote.
HISTORY:  A 41-year-old male with childhood juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.  The patient was seizure free for many years.  Patient missed medications, consumed alcohol, and suffered tonic-clonic seizure with right posterior scalp laceration.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with electrode modifications for the seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity and scant background theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in theta noted in the background.  The patient seems to be relatively drowsy.
In hyperventilation and in photic stimulation, there is intermittent, left mid temporal focal slowing with a mixture of theta and delta.  Brief stage 2 sleep includes POSTS and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to intermittent focal slowing noted from the left during hyperventilation and early drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In this individual with recent head trauma, correlation with imaging may be of value.
