CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with intermittent weakness of the legs and right arm.  Spells occur every 3-4 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Claritin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.  This is a technically satisfactory record, although T1-T2 impedances were slightly above 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 11 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  The patient quickly transitions to stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration a more prolonged EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
