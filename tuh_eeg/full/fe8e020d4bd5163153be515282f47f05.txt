Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
a posterior dominant rhythm can be seen intermittently and at best reaches 8Hz.  Background
activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Background activity is predominantly
irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal (right > left) region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 100
Summary of Findings:

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal
(right > left) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition,  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm that at best reaches
8Hz.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
