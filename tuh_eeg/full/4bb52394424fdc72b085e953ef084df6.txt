CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 74-year-old male found on the floor 2 days ago with right sided weakness followed by an episode of generalized shaking with unresponsiveness of 1 minute duration.  Status post trach, status post stroke.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.

TECHNICAL:  There is a small amount of muscle artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall background in wakefulness for this adult includes diffuse, 7 Hz theta with a glimpse of a posterior dominant rhythm. There is intermittent slowing noted in the background, particularly in the posterior quadrant.  Intermittently, the patient is a bit agitated with an increase in frontal muscle artifact.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  In drowsiness, occasional shifting asymmetries were noted.  Heart rate 96 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal bedside portable electroencephalogram due to:  Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  There are bihemispheric findings rather than specific focal features.  In this individual with a recent convulsion, a followup EEG when he is out of the ICU may be of value.
