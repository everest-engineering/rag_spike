History:	67 YO MALE STARTED W/ FACIAL TWITCHING LEFT > RIGHT PRIOR EVENING,
W/O LOC. RECEIVED BRAIN MET SURG AT UOP ( GAMMA KNIFE) A FEW DAYS
AGO. CHEMO UNTIL MAY, PALLIATIVE RADIATION THERAPY TO BRAIN. PT
C/C SPEECH PROBLEMS.
Medications:	Keppra, Dilantin 1500
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
No clear dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  No facial twitching appreciated during the course of the study.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The patient's clinical events of facial twitching were not captured during the recording.  No clinical
or electrographic seizures are present.
