History:	56 year old woman with a history of seizures since 18 year old.  Patient's last
reported seizure was ~ 2 weeks ago.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The background consists of moderate amplitude 7 Hz theta posteriorly, diffuse excess somewhat
monomorphic theta activity and weak AP gradient.  Patient remains awake throughout the
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal, anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and occasional
moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Occasional focal slowing is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
