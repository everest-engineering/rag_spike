CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman who suffered an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2007, status post clip, left sided weakness, migraines admitted now with stuttering speech and right arm shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, aspirin, Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is asleep throughout nearly the entire EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.  The patient was asleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Evaluation as to the cause for the patient's hypersomnolence may be appropriate.  Stimulation of the patient, asking the patient to count backwards from 10, produced a brief alerting with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm but wakefulness could not be sustained.  The patient was no longer stuttering or trembling during the EEG.
