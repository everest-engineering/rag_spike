History:	66 year old female status post-cardiorespiratory arrest, now with persistent coma.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours.  Nursing-initiated event buttons were
correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the
bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was extremely attenuated with
minimal spontaneous cerebral activity.  The background is diffusely suppressed.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, marked, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a markedly ABNORMAL 24 hour video-EEG because of severe diffuse attenuation with lack
of any clear cerebral activity.  These findings suggest severe brain injury with a grave prognosis for
neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
