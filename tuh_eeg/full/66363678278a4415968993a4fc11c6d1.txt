History:	59 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF SZS. SEVERAL A MONTH.  LAST SZ >1 WK AGO.
GTC/LOC TONGUE BITE POST CONFUSION.  SOMETIMES AURA OF BLINKING,
TREMORS. STARING.  HTN, REFLUX. FOLLOW UP EEG 3/17/14 SZ FREE FOR
>7 MONTHS
Medications:	AMLODIPINE, DIVALPROEX, DOXYCYCLINE, LOSARTAN, OMEPRAZOLE,
RANITIDINE, TEMAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  Immediately following hyperventilation, there are two brief 2 second
bursts of 3.5-4Hz spike-and-wave discharges seen. There is no overt clinical correlate to these.
Then, there are two additional, 1-2 second bursts seen during background recording.  There is a
single fragmented spike-wave seen in between photic stimuli presentation.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect (see
post-hyperventilation effect above).  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates at intermediate flash ranges.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, few, bilateral frontal
Interpretation:
This an ABNORMAL EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness due to the presence of 3.5-4Hz
spike-and-wave complexes. These findings suggest and are most commonly seen in idiopathic
generalized epilepsy.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
