History:	67 YO MALE C/O SOB, W/YELLING, CONFUSED, NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS.
LAST ADMIT 4/13 FOR COPD, SOB, GI BLEED.
PMHX: COPD, PE, HTN, ETOH
Medications:	heparin, folic acid, protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess theta activity of 7Hz during wakefulness was seen.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is present in the left temporal region maximum at F7-T1
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 102
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Occasional
focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was
not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
