CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old with history of new onset seizures, cerebral palsy,
scoliosis, behavioral disorder, G,tube. Seizures characterized by generalized shaking,
eyes rolling back in the head.
MEDICATIONS: Risperdal, Baclofen, Ativan, Prilosec.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The individual is wearing
mittens. He is hitting himself with the mittens or bouncing his head against the bed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is quite abnormal. It lacks
some typical adult morphologies. It is a low voltage pattern with beta activity and some
theta. The patient's bouncing activities produce artifact in the occipital region. There is
some question of some shifting asymmetries with perhaps a bit more from the left or
right posterior region. Ativan is given which increases the beta activity in the
background and decreases the patient's motor activity. Following Ativan there is a
question of possible POSTS in the background.
HR: 126bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Replacement of the normal anticipated background for an adult of this age with a
low voltage, primarily beta frequency pattern.
2.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. The bilaterally
abnormal background may be part of this patient's underlying neurodevelopmental
pathology. It will be a challenge to repeat the EEG in an attempt to identify epileptiform activity.
