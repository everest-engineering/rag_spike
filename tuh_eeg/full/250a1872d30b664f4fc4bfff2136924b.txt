CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with 2 tonic clonic seizures. First ever seizures. Diagnosed with glioblastoma 10 months ago, status post chemotherapy and radiation.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Keppra, Lisinopril, Pepcid, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. In addition, arrhythmic delta activity is identified from the left frontal central region. There are occasional sharp waves and/or sharply contoured delta in the left anterior quadrant, which may be maximum at FP1, F3, or T3. The field of delta can be relatively generous in the left hemisphere with delta extending to the left occipital region and a generous field of spread with sharply contoured slowing.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left frontal central, periodic slowing, sharp waves.
2. Sharply contoured slowing and focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximum in the frontal central and frontal temporal region.
3. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as a structural functional abnormality on the left which is epileptogenic in nature.
