LENGTH OF RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 86-year-old woman with an extensive past medical history that includes subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, ataxia, CHF and other.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, gabapentin, trazodone, tramadol, haloperidol, Depakote, Ativan as needed, buspirone and other.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic 7-8 Hz theta activity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Additional polymorphic theta activities captured.  During sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles and brief periods of discontinuity are observed.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in significant driving occipital response.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 27 minute EEG due to mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  A lot of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
