CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old left handed male with a history of cervical fracture in 2008, surgery in 2009 followed by multiple nocturnal seizures. Immobilized right arm.
The patient describes the seizures as left-sided shaking and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Metoprolol, Vicodin, Xanax, Ambien

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm, a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity,
and a small amount of frontal theta. The frontal theta is overall symmetric but with a
slight asymmetry. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the
background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small amount of excess theta in the frontal regions, left greater than right.
HR: 96 bpm
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The theta described is nonspecific in this context and
could be due to this patient's medications in that it is slightly asymmetric. Correlation
with imaging is suggested.
