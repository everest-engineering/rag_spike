CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed male wit h epilepsy since childhood,
tonic-clonic seizures, 1 to 2 per month with loss of consciousness, incontinence,
postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The
frontocentral regions are quite tow voltage and somewhat featureless. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in slowing. Stage I steep Includes rhythmic theta followed by
vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving response.
HR: 70 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The frontal regions are quite low voltage but are not
definitively pathological. There were no epileptiform features noted. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Additional recording in search of epileptiform
activity may be appropriate.
