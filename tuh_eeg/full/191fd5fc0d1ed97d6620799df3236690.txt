History:	42 YR OLD MALE WITH PRIOR EEGS, PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP LAST SZ
ACTIVITY 2/2014 ADMITTED AFTER RECENT SZ WITNESSED AT HOME. C/C
RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS, CHILLS, DIZZINESS.
Medications:	Keppra, Phenobarb
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 13 hours from 08/15/2014 to 08/16/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There is a slightly lower amplitude over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was mild reactivity to auditory
and tactile stimuli.  HR 90  Eye movements can be seen intermittently.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe diffuse
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  left hemisphere voltage attenuation, which is consistent
with the know cortical hemiatrophy in that region. In addition there is severe  diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
