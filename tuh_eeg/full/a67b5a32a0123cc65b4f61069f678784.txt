CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73 -year-old woman with 2 strokes, recurrent right-sided weakness, multiple evaluations for seizures versus syncope as well as multiple stroke-like symptoms, history of epilepsy treated with Trileptal and temporal sharp waves in 2009.  Evaluate for recurrent falls, most recent 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are performed.  This was a relatively somnolent patient.  Hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hz.  The overall background is disorganized.  There is arrhythmic delta activity noted from either hemisphere, a little bit more prominent in the left anterior temporal region.  Features of drowsiness included decrease in muscle and an increase in background slowing.  Patient waxes and wanes from an awake to drowsy state.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity throughout the left hemisphere.
As the patient transitioned towards drowsiness at the end of the EEG, there is a subtle C3 sharp wave noted.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Disorganization.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing and disorganization in this EEG is not significantly different than the 2009 study and in fact has improved compared to the 2007 study which demonstrated triphasic waves.  Some previous EEGs have identified left temporal sharp waves.  Today, there is a subtle underlying left central sharp wave.
The focal features described above and are congruent with a past history of seizure.  The focal sharp waves may be evaluated clinically in this individual with falling and a remote history of seizure.
