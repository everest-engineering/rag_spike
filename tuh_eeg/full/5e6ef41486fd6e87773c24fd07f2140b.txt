CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 90-year-old woman with recurrent stroke on the 20th.   Increasing left-sided weakness, treated briefly with Keppra.
MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, Aricept, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This is a technically acceptable EEG, although there were some electrodes with impedance greater than 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  While both hemispheres are slow, the left hemisphere includes a diffusely slow pattern with 6 hertz theta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta activity with disruption of faster frequency activity.  The patient is somewhat inattentive and frequent chew artifact was noted.
Occasional sharp waves were noted in the right frontal/frontotemporal region.  These seem to attenuate with stimulation.  Arrhythmic delta activity with both notable in the right frontal central/frontotemporal region.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically somewhat challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry with more significant arrhythmic delta activity and more slowing on the right.
Occasional right frontal sharp waves are sharply contoured transients in the context of right frontal central focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a structural process on the right with a cortical stroke, the sharp waves are in the region of the ischemic deficit.
