CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old male with long history of panic, anxiety and intermittent delirium.  Multiple evaluations over the last 2 years for change in mental status, patient has now had an episode of visual hallucinations.  Nonadherence with medications.  Tremor and cortical and cerebral and atrophy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was awake, but a little bit inappropriate and confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized with an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of background theta and beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background theta.  There is intermittent theta and generous beta noted in the background.
Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.  Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult, but it is remarkable for:
Mild excess theta.
Mild excess beta.
In comparison to previous EEGs, although there is some background beta and theta, this EEG is better organized than others.
