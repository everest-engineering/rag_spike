LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 64-year-old woman who presents to the hospital after falling down face first while getting out of bed.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, isosorbide, Lantus, atorvastatin, Advair, metformin, aspirin, metoprolol, gabapentin, Plavix, Lasix, amitriptyline, Percocet, Novolin, Excedrin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes, and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is captured throughout the recording.  During sleep, sleep spindles are captured.
Hyperventilation produces mild symmetrical slowing in the background.
Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  Continuous EKG artifact is present.
FINDINGS:
Phase II sleep
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 21-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform with discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effects, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
