EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was seen.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
