LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes and 40 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old man who presents with right-sided weakness that has improved since admission.
Past medical history is significant for non insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, GI bleed, stroke in 2009, and 1 episode of a seizure in 1996 status post surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, aspirin, Lovenox, hydralazine, Tylenol and lorazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency episode gradient.  Excess diffuse beta activity is observed.  During drowsiness voltage is decreased diffusely and vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed. Photic stimulation does not result in any change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for epilepsy still persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
