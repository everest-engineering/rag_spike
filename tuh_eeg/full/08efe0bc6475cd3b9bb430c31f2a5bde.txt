CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old left handed man with a history of hypertension, gout, atrial fibrillation, and pacemaker with 2 syncopal episodes and a fall.
MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 6 Hz and does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 4 to 6 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild to moderate generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
