History:	53 year old woman who presents with syncopal episodes.
Medications:	Gabapentin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Amplitude of PDR is higher than 50% on the left.  Fast alpha
variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
frequent up to 2 second inter-QRS pauses.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, higher voltage over the left
Cardiac arrhythmia,  frequent up to 2 second inter-QRS pauses
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG due to asymmetry in the amplitude of
posterior dominant rhythm, with higher voltages over the left. This finding is suggestive of focal
cerebral dysfunction over the right posterior quadrant.  A single EKG lead demonstrates frequent up
to 2 second inter-QRS pauses.  This finding was conveyed to the primary team.
