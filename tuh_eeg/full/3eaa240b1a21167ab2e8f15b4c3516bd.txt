CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male with recurrent Bell's palsy.

MEDICATIONS: Simvastatin, ASA, Geodon, Lisinopril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20

system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic

stimulation are performed. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and

asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG, at least

initially, is somewhat disorganized, but in later portions of the record, a more well

defined 9.5 hertz 40 microvolt alpha rhythm is noted. Early in drowsiness, however, the

is some disorganization and there is an inter hemispheric asymmetry. Normal sleep

morphologies from the left hemisphere are higher amplitude and a bit better developed

and there seems to be a little focal slowing from the right hemisphere. Photic stimulation

elicits scant driving. The patient seems to become a little drowsy during photic again

drifting off into sleep.



HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

1. Subtle focal slowing in the right hemisphere most prominent as the patient drifts off

to sleep.

2. At least initially modest background disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging and clinical

history. There were no definitive epileptiform features.
