CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed female with an episode of blurry vision,
numbness of the face and feet with jerking of the left arm. Multiple sclerosis, asthma, and possible complex partial seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation are performed. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact, more the left than the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low attenuating amplitude with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm. This may be subtly disrupted on the left but unfortunately there is also a bit more muscle artifact there. As the patient transitions toward drowsiness, there is occasional rhythmic or arrhythmic mixed theta/delta noted on the left. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response, but that driving response is better developed on the right compared to the left.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left, seen as intermittent finding.
2. Occasional mixed theta or delta noted from the left hemisphere particularly in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are subtle features and may be correlated with this patient's imaging and clinical history. No epileptiform features were noted.
