REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old man with a history of drug and alcohol abuse, lung cancer, hypertension, right eye blindness, and seizures.  He presented to the hospital after a change in mental status after abuse of drugs.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Dilantin, Protonix, morphine, Ketorolac.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T4 electrode artifact as well as some movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen during wakefulness.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation, which augmented some focal slowing which I will describe in abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 more than F8/T4 independently at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
Mild to moderate generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left more than right anterior temporal slow waves as well as excessive theta during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral focal cerebral dysfunction in the anterior temporal regions (left more than right), in addition to mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
