CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male with a gunshot wound to the head, now unresponsive
after sedative hypnotic medications such as propofol and fentanyl have been weaned.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Labetalol, Mannitol, Fentanyl, Lovenox, Protonix, Metoprolol,
Lisinopril, Vigamox, Keppra, Zofran, Labetalol, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and his eye is patched.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage alpha
and beta frequency pattern. The left eye is patched. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact
picked up from the left scalp electrodes which improve over time. There are intermittent bursts
of delta, a little bit more prominent from the left. There is variability in this record. Later portions
of the record are more of an alpha frequency pattern, earlier sections with a bit more beta.
Bursts of shifting sign a bit more prominent from the left are noted. Stimulation of the patient
produces some faster frequency activity. Vecuronium is utilized due to shivering movements
noted in the early part of the record. The patient was stimulated after the vecuronium had been
given. Stimulation did not activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Abnormal background with alpha and theta pattern.
CLINICAL There is a little bit of variability in this record although there was
little response seen to tactile stimulation although there was not extensive tactile stimulation for
this patient. In the absence of the use of sedative hypnotic medications, this EEG supports a
relatively significant bihemispheric disturbance involving gray and white matter. In the initial
study, there was a bit more slow delta on the right which is sometimes a bit more prominent on
the left. No sustained ictal discharges were noted.
