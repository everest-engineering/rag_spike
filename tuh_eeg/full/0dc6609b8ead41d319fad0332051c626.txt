History:	64 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SYNCOPE, PASSING OUT FOR
SEVERAL SEC, FOUND TO HAVE NSTEM, UNDERWENT CABG X3 ? HX (
NEURO HANDWRITING SO SMALL CAN'T  READ ) PMHX SIG FOR CAD, HTN,
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing was present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was change in the background
activity to tactile stimuli.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Technically limited
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  EEG is
limited because of abundant EMG and movement artifact.  If clinically indicated, suggest repeat
