CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old male status post two PEA codes on July 4, now with intermittent facial myoclonus, v-fib arrest on the 4th.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Zosyn, Vancomycin, Fentanyl, Dopamine, Lidocaine, Levophed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose with rare facial twitching.  Ativan drip, stopped at 11:00 a.m.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern.  There are intermittent bursts of fast activity followed by background attenuation.  The bursts of fast activity do not evolve.  Occasional facial twitching or muscle artifact is noted, but it does not impact the background.
The EEG until 2:47 was reviewed, and additional EEG recording will be performed to assess the response of therapy.
HR:    114 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A post-anoxic pattern with discontinuity and bursts of fast activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG carries a worrisome prognosis following anoxic insult and may be difficult to ameliorate.
EXTENDED EEG RECORDING SAME DAY
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Additional EEG recording is performed as the patient received IV Depakote.  Following the infusion of the IV Depakote, the patient continues to have a diffusely slowly and somewhat discontinuous pattern with brief bursts of fast activity.
Occasional muscle twitch is noted, but it seen sporadically, not in association with the bursts of fast activity.
HR:  N/A.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for:
A post anoxic pattern which was somewhat discontinuous with bursts of fast activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform seizures were seen.  These findings are worrisome following anoxic insult.
