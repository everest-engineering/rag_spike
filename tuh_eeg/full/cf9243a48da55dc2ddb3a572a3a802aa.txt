CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old male with cerebral palsy, multiple shunts, epilepsy and seizures.  The patient is now thought to have clinical seizures by the family at this time.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is moving about throughout the EEG.  At some points he is smiling and demonstrates facial grimacing.  He is unable to cooperative with the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  In addition, there are intermittent sharp waves noted at CZFV.  These wax and wane and do not seem to be associated with any changes in the patient's behavior. At the end of the EEG, just as the tech starts photic stimulation, more defined sharp waves and spikes with some frequency build-ups are noted in the right frontocentral region.  These have not completely abated by the end of the EEG, and in fact the patient is a bit more cooperative by the end of the EEG.  Photic stimulation does not produce other changes, and in fact the epileptiform activity had started before the photic.
HR:    104 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly abnormal background with marked background slowing.
Absence of the normal wave forms for an adult of this age.
What was likely another electrographic seizure from the right frontocentral region around the time of photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  During this EEG, the epileptiform discharge was not associated with any change in the patient's level of function.  A similar seizure was identified in the prior EEG.
