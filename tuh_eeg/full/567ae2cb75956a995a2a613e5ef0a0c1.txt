History:	84 year woman who earlier today had an episode of unresponsiveness and severe
tachycardia.  Of note, patient is status post a recent fall and a hip fracture.
Medications:	No AED; pain medications
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity
that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an expected anterior-to-posterior frequency -amplitude
gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Intermittent 50-75uV, 4-7Hz waves
are interspersed throughout the recording.  No normal sleep architecture is present but brief periods
of increase in theta and delta activity are observed.
No clear focal slowing is noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
occasional premature QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative
of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform discharges
are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates occasional
