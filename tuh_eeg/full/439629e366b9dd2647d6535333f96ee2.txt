AGE: 49 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE	Routine, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1314
HISTORY:
49 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for a history of 1 seizure two months ago while receiving wound care, requiring Ativan 4 mg. PMH COPD, Vasculitis.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
albuterol (PROVENTIL HFA;VENTOLIN HFA) 90 mcg/actuation inhaler, Inhale 2 puffs into the lungs every 6 hours as needed for Wheezing.
polyvinyl alcohol (LUBRICANT EYE, POLYV ALCOHOL,) 1.4 % ophthalmic solution, Place 1 drop into both eyes as needed. ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet, Take 800 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was perform ed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well
organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present
during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
There are occasional sharp waves seen over the left posterior quadrant that broadly distribute (TS > 01/P3) .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake-and-asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Occasional sharp waves seen over the left posterior quadrant that broadly distribute.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of potentially epileptogenic potentials over the left posterior quadrant.
