Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,  10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR was 72

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Excessive fast

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.   No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
