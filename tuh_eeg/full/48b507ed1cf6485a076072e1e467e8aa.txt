CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old woman with a change In mental status, left-sided weakness
and a tonic-clonic seizure earlier today. Past history of thyroid cancer. Evaluate for status
epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Meclizine, Theophylline
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-0 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient Is relatively somnolent
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite a great deal of muscle and motion artifact, there is a relatively continuous, periodic complex in the right hemisphere. Although the complex does
not evolve and at some point it starts to wane it never completely disappears. The data can be
reviewed at low paper speed. There is a little bit of a build-up to it but it never evolves into a
seizure and It tends to be more of a burst of sharp waves which lasts less than 10 seconds.
Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle and movement artifact. Later sections
of the record demonstrate more beta with a bit more beta on the left than the right. Tactile
stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response. Ativan is given during the EEG which
does not particularly impact the right temporal, periodic complexes although it does produce an
increase In background slowing.
HR: 100 bpm and sometimes irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A right mid to posterior temporal periodic complex with some frequency evolution.
CORRELATION: his EEG supports an irritative focus in the right temporal region.
Ongoing evaluation may be important to assess for subclinical seizures. The pattern described
above may be a postictal pattern or a late or interictal pattern.
