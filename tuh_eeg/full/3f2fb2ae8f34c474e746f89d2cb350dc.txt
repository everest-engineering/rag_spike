CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old male with recurrent episodes of dizziness, followed by generalized tonic-clonic activity and postictal fatigue and weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were NOT performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta and scant theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate 55 to 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this limited EEG.  In this individual with recurrent seizures, a follow up study capturing stage 2 sleep with hyperventilation and photic stimulation should be performed.
