CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old right handed woman admitted on the 10th with stroke.
History of odd speech, right carotid endarterectomy, cervical fusion, tongue cancer, acute left
ICA occlusion and left MCA/PCA hypodensity.
MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Protonix, Coumadin, Metoprolol, Zocor, Synthroid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10â•–20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed. This is an awake
record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow
pattern with an alpha rhythm of approximately 7.5 Hz. Mu activity is identified, although testing
is not performed to confirm this and it is also approximately 7 Hz. There is a disruption of faster
frequency activity including a disruption of the alpha rhythm on the left compared to the right. In
addition, there is a bit more muscle on the left compared to the right. As the patient becomes
drowsy, additional focal slowing is noted in the left hemisphere with the appearance of a bit
more rhythmic theta and some delta. Some of this is somewhat sharply contoured in the left
centrotemporal region. There is fluctuation in terms of the area of focal slowing and at times it Is
more prominent in the left posterior region. Photic stimulation is remarkable for supraharmonic
driving, best observed on the right compared to the left.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left hemisphere with variable maxima including left centrotemporal or
left occipital region.
2. Focal photic driving response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The supraharmonic driving response described above is a normal
variant. T fie focal slowing in the left hemisphere, accentuated by drowsiness, is an anticipated
finding following a stroke.
