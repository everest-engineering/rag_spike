CLINICAL HISTORY:  86 year old right handed woman with confusion, evaluate for seizures.  Left-sided weakness, facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone, Celexa, Prednisone, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.  The patient is very confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow and disorganized, but there are sections with 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Prominent arrhythmic delta activity is noted from the left temporal region with sharp waves. There are bursts of paroxysmal left temporal delta with sharp waves.  Unfortunately, although testing is performed, testing is not performed during the times that the patient is confused.  The patient is, however, globally confused and inattentive throughout. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response despite significant movement artifact.
HR:    114 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Left temporal sharp waves.
Paroxysmal bursts of left temporal focal slowing with unclear clinical correlates.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a highly epileptiform-appearing EEG and there are paroxysmal bursts which may represent subtle seizures.  Additional evaluation is important to make sure that this patient is not having subclinical seizures.
