Continuous ambulatory EEG recording was performed for 2 days. Patient diaries were reviewed,

automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
08:30 PM As per her diary, she was in a car with her friend. Suddenly midsentence she forgot where
she was doing and what she was talking about.
The EEG during that time was normal awake with no changes.
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Deeper stages of sleep were recorded.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 48 hour ambulatory EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
