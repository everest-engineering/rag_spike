CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old left handed male status post MVA on May 20, 2010 with
right occipital hematoma and past history of craniotomy. Evaluate for seizures. Tonic clonic seizure reported today, somewhere along the line of the acute head injury.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. He is noted to have an absent bone Rap on the left
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The right hemisphere demonstrates a well organized
pattern with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. The left hemisphere demonstrates a breech rhythm with
higher amplitude activity on the left and additional left 5-7.5 Hz activity. The higher amplitude activity on the left extends almost to the midline. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing and some of the focal slowing on the left transitions to delta. At the very close of the record there is a single burst of sharply contoured slowing out of the left hemisphere, including the central parietal. It is medium amplitude and has a generous field of spread. Hyperventilation produces an Increase amplitude of the background, as well as accentuating the focal slowing on the left. Photic stimulation elicits driving, better represented on the right.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
2. An asymmetric photic driving response and an asymmetric hyperventilation response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The study is improved compared to a previous study at the time of
his acute head trauma. The focal HV and the focal hyperventilation response support
hemisphere injury on the left. This study is improved compared to the April 21, 2010 EEG.
