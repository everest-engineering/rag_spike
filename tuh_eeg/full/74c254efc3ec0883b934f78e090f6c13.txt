History:	82 year old woman who had a witnessed episode of unresponsiveness that occurred
~2 weeks ago.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal, mild-to-moderate
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly asleep 24-minute EEG due to intermittent mild-to-
moderate focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
