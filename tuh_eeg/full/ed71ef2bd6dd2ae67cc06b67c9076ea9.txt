CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 38-year-old male with 5 year history of epilepsy.  Recent switch from Keppra to Lamictal with seizure December 23rd in preceded by bad taste, fall, then tonic-clonic activity.  Family history of epilepsy.
INTRODUCTION:  A 30 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. It is technically acceptable.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a primarily awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Generous frontal central beta was noted.  Central mu activity was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Epileptiform activity in this record included right mid to anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes, typically maximum at F8/T2 occasionally T4.  Approximately 1 dozen of these discharges were noted.  Most were associated with focal slowing with bursts of focal slowing, lasting up to 3 seconds following the sharp waves, aside from the epileptiform activity, interictal focal slowing was quite rare.
Heart rate 54 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
High amplitude right anterior temporal sharp waves noted in wakefulness.
Associated focal slowing with the epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  There are no previous EEGs for comparison.
