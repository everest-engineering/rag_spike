CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 75-year-old, right-handed woman with recurrent seizures or confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Plavix, aspirin, ?Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: 24-hour digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. No clinical seizures were recorded. There is a significant amount of muscle in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in arrhythmic delta activity.  While there is a significant amount of artifact, in sleep there is small, discreet left temporal sharp waves, which are identified on rare occasions.  In artifact through portions of the record, the phase reversal may be T3-T1 and occasionally T1-T3.  The patient is noted to have frequent arousals from sleep with a great deal of muscle and movement during the night.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare left temporal sharp waves, which may be anterior temporal or mid-to-posterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  These are simple in morphology, but are not seen on the right and therefore would have a higher probability of being epileptiform than a normal variant.
