CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old male with HIV and epilepsy.  The patient had a seizure, fell down the flight of stairs and had a facial injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Xanax, Depakote, Lovenox, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the EEG lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The impedances were generally under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  The patient was wearing a hard collar.  This study was performed in the lab, but does not include hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall EEG is well organized with a 10 hertz, 30 microvolt symmetric and reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by an increase in theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  For this individual with potential seizure related injury, a follow-up study as an outpatient to more completely capture his epileptiform pattern is suggested.
