CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male who developed epilepsy at age 45 after treatment with Wellbutrin for depression.  Patient continues to have tonic-clonic seizures, uncontrolled by Depakote and phenytoin.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, metformin, phenytoin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20  system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record. This is a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances below 5 ohms with the exception of T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 hertz symmetric and reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with an increase in beta and vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous, bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation failed to significantly activate the record.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG- awake and sleep
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study may be obtained.
