CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of alcohol abuse, who presents with 3 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the lethargic state, there was diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background consisting of 5-6 Hz theta frequency activity intermixed with 2-3 Hz delta activity, 10-20 microvolt in amplitude.  There is spontaneous variability seen with increase in background frequency intermittently. There is also reactivity seen in the form of increased background frequency on stimulating the patient. There is presence of low amplitude diffuse beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.
Heart rate was 90 to 100 beats per minute with wide QRS complexes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing is suggestive of either toxic, metabolic, anoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effects of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepine, barbiturate, or could be due to anxiety or hyperthyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
No seizures are captured.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or of intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
