History:	57 YO MALE W/ PMHX FOCAL PARTIAL EPILEPSY, LEFT S/P TEMPORAL
LOBE, RESULTS IN RIGHT PARESIS.
PT GTC SZ 3 MONTHS AGO.
Medications:	Trileptal, Depakene
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.   5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, over right hemisphere
maximal over the frontal region.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal over the mid
temporal region during wakefulness.  There is an associated increase amplitude over this region
consistent with a breach rhythm. At times the delta is sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 90, some PVC were noted.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal mid temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere maximal over the mid temporal region.  This finding is consistent with the known
surgical resection.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
