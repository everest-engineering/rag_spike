CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old woman admitted with confusional spell, TIA, atrial fibrillation, history of extensive posterior circulation cerebrovascular disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl, metoprolol, insulin. Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with post impedances below 5 kiloohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is a mixed frequency pattern with rhythmic theta and background delta.  There is a suggestion in some sections of the record of a 5.6 hertz alpha rhythm on the left, slightly slower on the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are intermittent attenuations in the background.  There is a subtle, simple sharp wave with underlying phase reversal sometimes seen at FA, T4, or C4 with little in the way of an after going slow wave.
Arousal produces an increase in theta.
Heart rate irregular 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
An asymmetry with somewhat slower faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere relative to the left and a bit more delta.
Subtle underlying sharp waves in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  The sharp waves may be correlated with the patient's imaging and clinical history.
