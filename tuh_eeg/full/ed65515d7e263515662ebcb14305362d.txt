CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 43-year-old man who presents status post fall and loss of consciousness.  Of note, the patient has been sleep deprived approximately 3 days prior to this event.  Additionally, he has had a similar episode prior, this episode was associated with long periods of insomnia.

MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are Ambien, Serax, valium, Lovenox, Protonix, aspirin, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a very low amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Frequent eye blinking and lateral eye movement artifact is observed over the bifrontal leads.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor to fair effort and produces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 24 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
