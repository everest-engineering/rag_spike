CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right handed man with a history of seizures with drug abuse that began when he was a child and worsened after being struck by a truck.  He describes that his head turns to the right and he makes noises.  He has complaints of short-term memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Suboxone.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard the 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background that reaches 8.5 to 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation revealed abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at T3 and occasionally at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left more than right midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evaluation of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left more than the right midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
