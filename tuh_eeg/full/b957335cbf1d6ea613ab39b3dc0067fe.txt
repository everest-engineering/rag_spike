CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old woman with possible epilepsy, multiple suicide attempts, drug abuse.  The patient is admitted to the hospital after being found unconsciousness in bed for an unknown period of time.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, antibiotics, Tylenol, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient seems quite drowsy.  Despite this, in wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 Hz.  There is some shifting slowing noted in the background, as well as FIRDA.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  The patient is drifting in and out of sleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Background slowing.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Rare FIRDA.
Rare shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The pattern identified is a nonspecific pattern and can be seen in encephalopathy due to many different causes.
