History:	36 YR.OLD WOMAN LH WITH HEADACHES FOR ONE YEAR LOCATED IN THE
FRONTALLY WITH A THROBBING QUALITY. .51 CM HEAD
Medications:	CYCLOBENZAPRINE,GABAPENTIN,MIRTAZAPINE,AMITRIPTYLINE,OMEPRAZOLE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates the excess
theta.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
