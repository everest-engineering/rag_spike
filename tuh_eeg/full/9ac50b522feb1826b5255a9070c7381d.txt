LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The recording was performed at the EEG laboratory.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures.  Prior to seizures, the patient had severe traumatic brain injury as a result of motor vehicle accident.  The patient has a seizure approximately every 2 months.  They are characterized by blurring vision, loss of consciousness and generalized tonic/clonic convulsion.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Trental and Levothroid.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Test alpha variant is abundant throughout the recording. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Frequent blink artifact is noted throughout the recording.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in mild diffuse symmetrical slowing.  Step photic stimulation does not result in no occipital driving.  During drowsiness, burst of diffuse theta captured.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
Fast alpha variant.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 27 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.  , however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
