History:	28 YR FEMALE PRESENTED TO ER  UNRESP, PT HAD SEVERE HA, PER
FAMILY PT HAD SZ DURING RIDE OVER TO ER.   IN ER FOUND TO HAVE NO
PULSE.  CPR STARTED PULSE RETURNED.  APPROX 11/30/15 23:30 PM PT
TEMP 93.3 ON WARMING BLANKET.
Medications:	11:30 PM ROCURONIUM, ETOMIDATE, NOW  NOREPINEPHRINE, POTASSIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies
is not seen.  There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording. Except for a period
of 40 seconds where some diffuse very low amplitude alpha discharge seems to appear at around
10:19. It is unclear if this is cerebral or artifactual.  There is no spontaneous state change during the
recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.  This EEG was performed
according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination
of electrocerebral inactivity.  No normal sleep was seen
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84  EKG, ventilator and muscle artifact particularly one seen at
10:19 impede the clear interpretation of the EEG.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity, nearly continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because This is a mainly isoelectric EEG performed according the the
ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  This EEG in the absence of
sedatives is suggestive of a very poor prognosis. Please note that artifacts  in the ICU impede the
clear evaluation at background an a diagnosis of brain death cannot be made.
