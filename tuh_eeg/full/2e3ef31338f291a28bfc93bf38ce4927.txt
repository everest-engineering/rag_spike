CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old male with continuous left leg jerking for 2.5 years after right leg above-the-knee amputation, evaluate for epilepsy partialis continua.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  There are no clinical notes as to whether or not the patient was experiencing the involuntary movements during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, symmetric reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in theta.
Heart rate: 84 bpm.
Hyperventilation  and Photic Stimulation:  Not performed.
Jerking of the left leg was recorded.  This seems to result in an arousal from the drowsy state and did not carry an EEG signature.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A single leg jerk that identified did not have an EEG signature.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study may be of value.
