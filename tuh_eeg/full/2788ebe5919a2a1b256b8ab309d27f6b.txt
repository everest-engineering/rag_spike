History:	59 YO MALE ADMITTED BACK IN 3/2014 FOR WORSENING LEFT SIDE
WEAKNESS, AND MULTIPLE EMBOLIC INFARCTS AT THAT TIME. WAS SENT
TO ED FOR NOT TALKING AND BEING UNRESPONSIVE
PHHX: LEFT FEMORAL BONE GRAFT, HTN, USSES WALKER AND LVES IN NH.
Medications:	METOPROLOL, ASA, LISINOPRIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
