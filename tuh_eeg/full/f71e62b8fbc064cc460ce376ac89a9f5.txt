CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, head trauma, falling in the bathroom, presents after being found in bed seizing and foaming at the mouth.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Dilantin, Pantoprazole.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during stupor and lethargy.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background, mainly in the delta frequency at 2 to 4 Hz, seen diffusely.  At times, there is some architecture reminiscent of stage I/stage II sleep with some vertex waves and spindles.  No activating procedures were performed; however, during the recording the patient was stimulated and there was nice increase in the frequencies to theta discharges and muscle artifact seen diffusely.  In addition, there are short bursts of diffuse attenuation seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording with intermittent bursts of suppression; however, there is nice reactivity to the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and intermittent suppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  The intermittent suppression as well as the improvement with reactivity suggests that this is due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
