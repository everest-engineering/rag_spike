CLINICAL HISTORY:   61 year old right handed female for follow up EEG after a right frontal meningioma resection.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Neurontin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mainly asleep patient, but when awake has a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a slightly increased frontal central beta bilaterally, but slightly more seen on the left than the right.  Normal sleep architecture in stage I and stage II sleep is seen. Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Intermittent F7/F3 focal slowing occasionally, in the setting of a breach.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal slow waves in breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region which is possibly related to her surgery for the meningioma resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
