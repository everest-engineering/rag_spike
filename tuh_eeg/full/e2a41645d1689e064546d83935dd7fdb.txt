DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.  Again, the patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.
