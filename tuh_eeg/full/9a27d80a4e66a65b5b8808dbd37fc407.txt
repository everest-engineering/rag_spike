History:	78 year old man who presents with recurrent staring episodes, wondering episodes,
unexplained cuts and bruises.

Of note, patient is currently ill and generally weak.
Medications:	Depakote, Celexa
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Unstable 7-8 Hz theta activity is captured posteriorly.  AP gradient is weak.  The background consists
primarily of polymorphic theta activity.  During brief drowsiness,  degree of theta activity increases
and EMG artifact vanishes.
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates frequent premature QRS complexes
that are followed by up to 1.5 second pauses.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Other, premature QRS complexes and resultant up to 1.5 sec pauses
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 25 minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-to-
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  A single EKG lead demonstrates frequent premature QRS
complexes that are followed by up to 1.5 second pauses.
