CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Cogentin, Haldol, Celexa.  Trileptal on hold.
INTRODUCTION:  This EEG represents 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring with seizure and spike detection.  Standard 10-20 system of electrode placement was utilized.  No clinical events were noted and no events were noted by the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness and sleep:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  Intermittently in wakefulness, focal slowing was noted from the left temporal region.  This is more prominent in the earlier sections of the record.
Sleep:  Sleep is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  The sleep pattern tends to be relatively low voltage and more representative of a lighter sleep pattern with a paucity of evidence of the deeper stages of sleep.  Sleep is also somewhat disrupted.
Interictal epileptiform detections:  None.
Electrographic seizures:  None.
Push button events __________ 5:36 p.m.:  This is a practice pushbutton.  The patient was awake.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This section of 24-hour video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:
Left temporal focal slowing, improving over the course of the record.
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Additional EEG monitoring will be performed.
