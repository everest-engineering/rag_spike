History:	35 year old man who found having seizures.  PMH is notable for dialysis, HTN,
Medications:	Depakote, Ativan, propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude theta and delta activity with diffuse overriding alpha activity that is seen predominantly
in the anterior leads.  Occasional periods of discontinuity are seen.  There is intermittent movement
artifact and there is nearly continuous right hemispheric low amplitude EMG artifact.
No electrographic seizures are seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of  moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  However,
based on the waveforms seen, at least some degree of slowing is medication induced (propofol
specifically).  These findings were conveyed to the neurology resident on-call.
