CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old who presented to the hospital on the 1st with repetitive seizures, incontinence, and twitching on the left.  Obtunded afterwards with serum glucose of 600.
MEDICATIONS:  Cogentin, Keppra, insulin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a very drowsy patient.  In maximum wakefulness, there is a glimpse of an eye in its alpha rhythm.  Then the patient drift off to sleep , and there is an increase in background theta.  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage.  The patient's transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep.
Heart rate 104 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for
A low voltage pattern.
An excessively drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This may will be a normal EEG in a very sleepy patient.  The background theta appears in a minute the patient was unstimulated.  No focal or epileptiform futures were identified.  There were no specific hallmarks of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy in an low voltage pattern, is not pathological in an adult of this age.
