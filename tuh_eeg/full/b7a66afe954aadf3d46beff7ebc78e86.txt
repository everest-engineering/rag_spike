CLINICAL HISTORY: 95 year old woman with epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer disease, evaluated
for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
Â·
left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG when the patient is resting quietly is
a low voltage, rhythmic, slow 3. 7 to 4 Hz pattern. There are bursts of shifting asymmetry with more arrhythmic delta activity on the right compared to the left In addition, with arousal, there
is an increase in faster frequency activity. With tactile stimulation, the patient has an arousal
which produces muscle artifact which essentially obscures the EEG and then she drifts off to
sleep.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
.
Replacement of normal background with primarily a rhythmic theta frequency pattern.
2.
There are portions of the record with a clearly defined asymmetry with slower delta on the
right compared to the left and some sharp wave contoured activity in the left frontocentral
region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Due to the improvement in the patient's cooperativity, this EEG
provides a much more complete picture than the study performed in 2009. Consequently, there
can be no assumptions made as to whether one study is better or worse than the other, but both
support a severe disturbance of cerebral function. Seizures in this case may localize to the left
frontocentral region. but the right hemisphere is slower.
