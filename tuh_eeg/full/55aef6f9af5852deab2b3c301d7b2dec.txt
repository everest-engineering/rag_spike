History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON 38 YR MALE S/P LIVER TX WITH COMPLICATION.  PT
WITH CHANGES IN MS.  PMHX: ESLD/ TX, HEP C, ADRENAL INSUFF, HTN,
MULTI INTUBATIONS PT GOING FOR TRACH TODAY
Medications:	MORPHINE PRN, INSULIN, URSODIOL, CEFEPIME, HEPARIN, VANCOMYCIN,
CELLCEPT, PROGRAF, PREDNISONE, PROTONIX, MYCAMINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 108
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
