CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old man with new onset dizziness and drowsiness of 1-month duration, each episode lasting about 1 hour.  This is associated with pressure on the right side of the head.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement at the bedside and one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a bilaterally symmetric alpha rhythm of 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.
Drowsiness is characterized by increase in beta, attenuation of alpha and some rhythmic central theta.
Photic stimulation did not elicit any abnormalities.
Heart rate 62 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
