History:	40 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CP SZ IN 7/2013 ALONG WITH LTM,
NOW FOR FOLLOW UP EEG, PT DENIES ANY RECENT SZ ACTIVITY.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-8 Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Excessive or inappropriate sleep patterns, Excessive theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
