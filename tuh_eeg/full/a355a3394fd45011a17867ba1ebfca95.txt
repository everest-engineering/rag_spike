CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old ambidextrous woman with refractory seizures right sided shaking, and right facial twitching.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Phenobarbital, Keppra, Zoloft, Levothyroxine, Isordil, Lipitor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly cooperative today.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates almost exclusively muscle and a slow background. There are brief sections where a discernible underlying left anterior temporal sharp wave is noted with a generous field of spread in the left hemisphere. The epileptiform activity is not monomorphic, some of it has more of an anterior spread, mid temporal spread, and it clearly involves even the left parietal region. Epileptiform activity is likely, easily under recognized because of the muscle artifact. At the close of the record there are a few more sharp waves.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing with more of a rhythmic theta pattern.
2. Beneath the muscle artifact there is epileptiform activity which at least at the close of the record is actually periodic in nature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Ongoing observation is important because this patient's muscle artifact can be obscuring epileptiform activity although no definitive seizures were observed.
