CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 94-year-old resident of Caring Heart Nursing Home with previous stroke, encephalopathy, and seizure, evaluated March 22 for an episode where the patient was staring, nonverbal with eyes deviating to the left and moving the right arm.  EEG at that time demonstrated diffuse slowing on the left and a handful of left frontal sharp waves.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was very uncomfortable sitting up.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a 7.5 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, generous beta, and a modest amount of theta.  Occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta were noted.
Photic stimulation was difficult as the patient was very uncomfortable, but no definitive driving response was noted.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In contrast to a previous EEG, no focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The background slowing is a nonspecific finding, particularly in an adult of this age.
