CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old right handed male with a history of head trauma following MVA in 1980s, post traumatic epilepsy for the last 30 years, seizures out of sleep characterized by shaking, also history of sleep walking, right frontal gliosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  There is excess muscle artifact noted throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage EEG.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record which increases the amplitude of the background and then an 11 Hz alpha rhythm can be identified. As the patient drifts off to sleep there is some bursts of shifting slowing from the left or the right. There is a glimpse of a photic driving response.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically unsatisfactory EEG due to:  Problematic electrode issues with excess muscle which would not resolve throughout the EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were some bursts of shifting slowing.  No epileptiform activity was noted.  A repeat tracing, perhaps a more prolonged tracing is suggested to more completely evaluate this patient.
