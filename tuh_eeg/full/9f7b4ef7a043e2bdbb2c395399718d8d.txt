History:	52 YR MALE WITH EPISODE OF GTC SZ. FOUND USING K2 SYNTHETIC DRUG.
IN ED WITNESSED GTC. LIP BITE. AGGRESSION POST ICTAL. X30 MIN.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal sharp waves with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F7.  At times this appear to become slightly periodic.  Independent rare
focal sharp waves with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F8.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent frontotemporal
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
seen independently in the left more than right fronto temporal regions.  These findings are
indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this regions. In addition there is  intermittent focal
slowing in the left fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.
