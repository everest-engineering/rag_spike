CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old right handed male, seizure free for 7 years, applying for driver license.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable record capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity, and lambda was noted.  Features of drowsiness including increase in beta followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, POSTS, and stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces scant increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Normal EEG.  Does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
