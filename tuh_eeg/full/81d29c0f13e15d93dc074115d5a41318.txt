CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old male with migraine headaches with loss of vision, aphasia, and allodynia, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Fioricet, Elavil, codeine, and Maxalt.
INTRODUCTION:  A one-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. It is one-hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a background that has excess theta and a small degree of disorganization.  In wakefulness and in drowsiness, there was intermittent, subtle focal slowing noted with a bit more irregular theta from the left temporal region in comparison to the right.  Brief sleep includes vertex waves with scant spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited scant, bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta and does subtly accentuate the left focal features.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Excess theta.
Mild background disorganization.
Subtle underlying slowing from the left hemisphere primarily left temporal region and primarily in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings should be correlated with clinical history in this individual with complex polypharmacy.  The subtle focal features may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.
