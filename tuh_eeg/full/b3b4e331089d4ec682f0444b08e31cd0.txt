CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman, who had a single seizure last week, found on the ground with generalized shaking, no tongue biting or incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Ambien, Zoloft, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour and 20-minute EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.  The patient was primarily awake or drowsy throughout the EEG.  We did hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In relaxed wakefulness, there is rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity seen in the left or right central parietal regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
In relaxed wakefulness, the rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity was noted in the left or right central parietal regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the activity slows slightly into the 3-4 hertz range.
The patient was tested with each discharge and was consistently responsive.  In addition, tactile or auditory stimulation of the patient consistently produced an elimination of the rhythmic discharge.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for,
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic discharges seen in the central regions are most compatible with SREDA of the elderly.  Although this is typically a 5-7 hertz discharge, it can be seen as a 3-4 hertz discharge as noted in this record.  In addition, consistently, activating the patient produced cessation of the discharge, which would again be characteristic of this normal variant.
