History:	55 YO FEMALE WITH PRIOR EEG. HX OF ? SZ EPISODES. NO EPISODES SINCE
LAST EEG 2/5/2015 NO CHANGES PER PT
Medications:	KEPPRA, NEURONTIN, ELAVIL, FLEXERIL, VALIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.
