CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed male with increasing seizures, the last seizure 2 weeks ago, epilepsy since infancy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation produces a small degree of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this EEG nor in the previous study. To further characterize this individual's epilepsy, an outpatient ambulatory study or a more prolonged study with sleep is suggested.
