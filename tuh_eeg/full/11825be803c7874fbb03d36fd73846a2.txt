CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old woman with frequent falls, history of brain aneurysm,vertigo, MI and COPD.  Please evaluate for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax and Flexeril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  No mention of a previous craniotomy was made.  Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1-T2 electrode.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.
In drowsiness, there is a scant, shifting slowing in the temporal regions.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to a small degree of shifting slowing noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  In this individual with a history of previous aneurysm repair, the shifting slowing may be part of this clinical picture.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing some of her symptoms may be of value.
