History:	73 yo male p/w status epilepticus. Pt was in the car with his with when his L leg
began to twitch, then progressed into generalized convulsions. Eyes rolled up.
Versed x3, Ativan 2 mg broke SZ. 30 mins duration. Non-compliant on meds. Head
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present and at best reached 8 HZ with a very low amplitude..
Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta/ theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  At times some central faster frequencies were noted.
No normal sleep architecture was present but state changes were noted with lack of muscle artifact.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
