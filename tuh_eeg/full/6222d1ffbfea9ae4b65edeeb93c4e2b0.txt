CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 28-year-old woman who experienced a single, generalized tonic clonic seizure in September 2012.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Intermittent MU rhythm and lambda are captured.  During sleep POSTS (posterior occipital sharp transients of sleep) vertex waves, K complexes, and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Heart rate below 60 beats per minute is captured during sleep.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Heart rate fewer than 60 beats a minute during sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 23 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
