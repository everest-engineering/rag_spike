CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old male status post double lung transplant January 17, 2015, status post recurrent cardiac arrest, shock more than 50 times in the evening of January 30th through January 31st, unresponsive on multiple pressors and ECMO.
MEDICATIONS:  Vasopressin, epinephrine, meropenem, no sedative hypnotics.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient was intubated, on a re-warmer with body temperature 37, comatose with unreactive pupils and absent corneal responses.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a very low voltage pattern.  While there may be some ICU artifact, there does appear to be scant, low voltage, cerebral activity was some theta and delta which cannot be considered artifactual.  There is no reactivity or variability.
EKG lead N/A.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Low voltage, suppressed pattern.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although there may be some rhythmic theta frequency ICU artifact, in this record  there is discernable  low voltage cerebral activity.  Individual with multiple cardiac arrest over the last 24 hours, this is a very worrisome prognostic pattern.  Ongoing clinical evaluation may be helpful to further assess cerebral function.
