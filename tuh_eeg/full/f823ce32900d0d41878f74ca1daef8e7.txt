History:	72 year old man with a history of left sided twitching.  Patient has a history of right
sided GBM.
Medications:	Dilantin, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
During maximal arousal there is fragmented unstable 9-10 Hz PDR with some expected AP
gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic theta activity.  Voltages are diffusely very low.  Patient
transitions rapidly into sleep.  Sleep is characterized by diffuse theta and delta activity with spindle-
like waveforms.  There is subtle underriding polymorphic delta activity over the right with subtle
underriding fast activity over the right (breach rhythm).  Several blunted broad sharp waves are
captured during sleep over T4/T6/C4 electrodes.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is continuous EKG artifact.
Heart rate increases to 110-120 bpm during arousals/ periods of agitation.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric
Breach artifact, right
Sharp waves, few, right, midtemporal- central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 23-minute EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing; (2) subtle
continuous moderate right hemispheric slowing and (3) several right midtemporal-central
epileptiform discharges. Diffuse background slowing indicates etiologically non-specific mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction that in this case could at least partially be related to excessively tired/ drowsy
patient (given rapid transitions to sleep).  Continuous focal slowing and several epileptiform
discharges over the right (specifically midetmporal- central region) are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the that region.  Breach rhythm is secondary to a skull
