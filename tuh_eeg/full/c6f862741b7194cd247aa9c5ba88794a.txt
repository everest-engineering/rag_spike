CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right handed man with known history of epilepsy, diabetes, hypertension and pineal cyst. The patient has a history of left temporal lobe complex partial seizures. This is a follow up EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Oxcarbazepine, Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Insulin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness the background EEG shows an 8.3 hertz alpha rhythm. There is slowing seen bilaterally of low amplitude. There are occasional left temporal sharp waves seen on the study. Also seen in stage I sleep are vertex waves. Also seen on the study are bilateral temporal delta.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excessive background slowing.
2. Bitemporal slowing.
3. Small left temporal sharps intermittent.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: As compared to previous studies, there is less epileptiform activity seen. The bitemporal slowing is a nonspecific finding in an adult of this age. It may be related to the epilepsy or his underlying atherosclerotic disease.
