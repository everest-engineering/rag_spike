CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old right handed woman with Dandy-Walker abnormality, perimenstrual seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized.  It is primarily an alpha and theta frequency mix of activities.  There is a suggestion of a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall background is quite sharply contoured and there seems to be a sharp wave in the central parietal regions which is nearly isoelectric at CZ.  Sharply contoured activity is also picked up at PZ. Hyperventilation produces an increase in slowing.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit more arrhythmic delta noted in the right hemisphere with sharply contoured slowing on the right. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Sharp waves which are at the midline or sometimes to the right or left of the midline and which may be at PZ or FC.
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Sharply contoured slowing with some sharp waves in the right central temporal region.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous studies.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as more than 1 mechanism for this patient's seizures.
