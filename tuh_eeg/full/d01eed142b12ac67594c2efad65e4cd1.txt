CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old male with a seizure August 19th, characterized by shaking of left arm, eyes rolling up, incontinence, and then generalized shaking.  Left parietal infarct.  Acute left hemispheric stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.  Tactile stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with bihemispheric mixed theta and delta.  The patient is restless with head rocking artifact.  Stimulation of the patient does not particularly activate the record.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG is most supportive of a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  If additional information is needed, a follow up test may be performed.
