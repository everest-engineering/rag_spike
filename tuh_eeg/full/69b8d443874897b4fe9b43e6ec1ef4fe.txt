CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old male, found unresponsive with a large pontine bleed.
MEDICATIONS:  Generalized background slowing.
2. Occasional shifting slowing.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Found unresponsive.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal lead and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while comatose.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm, no normal frontal central beta and no normal sleep architecture seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There is generalized slow waves at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  Intermixed with the delta there was bursts of spindles seen throughout the recording almost continuously.  At one point during the recording the patient stimulated and there was no reactivity on the EEG.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Frequent spindles in an unresponsive person.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the pattern seen in a spindle coma and reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  A spindle coma in relationship to a brainstem lesion carries a poor prognosis.
