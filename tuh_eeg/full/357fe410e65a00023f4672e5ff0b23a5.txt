CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old man with a history of multiple strokes and septic shock, now with tonic-clonic seizure this morning.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, Insulin, Reglan, Heparin, Pantoprazole, Colistimethate
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and no activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Multi-electrode artifact due to continuous movement and muscle artifact seen in all electrodes throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals at best a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 6-7 Hz.  There is some minimal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the right anterior temporal region and left anterior temporal region independently, slightly more pronounced over the left.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and independent bilateral (left more than right) anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This very limited EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction as well as independent bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.  Please note that this was a poor quality EEG due to agitation of the patient and no clear definitive statements can be made, however, a repeat EEG with deeper sedation may aid in clarifying or confirming a diagnosis if clinically desired.
