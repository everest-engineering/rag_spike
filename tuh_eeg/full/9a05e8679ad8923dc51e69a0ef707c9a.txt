AGE: 74 y.o.
SEX:male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma study EEG #: 15-1392
HISTORY:
74 y.o. male with a pontine infarct, weakness, unresponsiveness, and worsening shortness of breath referred for routine EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is continuous, symmetric, and consists of a poorly organized mixture of alpha, theta, and delta.	Although spontaneous movements are noted on video, there is no definite reactivity to noxious stimulation. Sleep transients are not captured.
There is moderate to severe generalized slowing.
No definite focal slowing is present, though there is low amplitude muscle artifact over the right fronto-temporal leads
for the majority of the study. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES : There is no reactivity to visual , auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 95 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:
Moderate to severe generalized slowing
Suboptimal organization
Lack of definite EEG reactivity despite noxious stimuli and patient-initiated movements
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
These findings are nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
If clinically indicated, a longer study can be obtained to re-assess for reactivity and variability.
