CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with shoulder pain, depression, past history of cocaine use and recurrent syncope.  The patient with episodes of loss of consciousness proceeded by a sense of impending doom and chest pain.
MEDICATIONS:  Zolpidem, Xanax, Desyrel, Prozac, Motrin, and Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  It is a routine, 20-minute technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  At times, there appears to be an alpha harmonic.  In the waking background, there is a subtle, underlying arrhythmic delta activity noted in the occipital temporal regions bilaterally.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate rhythmic slowing from the left hemisphere particularly mid and posterior temporal regions.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous driving response bilaterally, but a much more defined response on the right in comparison to the left.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent irregular slowing noted in the posterior temporal regions bilaterally.
Intermittent focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere particularly temporal regions accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although no epileptiform features were seen, consideration for a structural or functional process on the left is appropriate.  In addition, given the bilateral posterior temporal features, correlation with imaging is suggested.
