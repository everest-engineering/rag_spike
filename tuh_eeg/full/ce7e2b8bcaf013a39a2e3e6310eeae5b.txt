AGE: 44 y.o.
DATE OF STUDY: 11/17/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1682
HISTORY:
44 y.o. male with a history of seizures, as well as drug and alcohol abuse, referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
docusate sodium (COLACE) 100 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth
2 times daily as needed for Constipation.
hydrocortisone (ANUSOL-HC) 2.5 % rectal cream, Use as directed SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythmÂ·(PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During brief periods of drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements , attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy one-hour EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and (briefly) drowsy EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy . Of note, this is the patient' s third normal EEG.
