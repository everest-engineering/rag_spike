History: 64 YO RH MALE WITH LEFT LEG TWITCHING AND LEFT ARM POSTURING DURING SLEEP. EVENT HAS OCCURRED 2X IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS
Medications: None
Sedation:
EEG Type: Extended, 40-60 m1n
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. awake. drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV. 18-25Hz activity is present. maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent. and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. No focal slowing Is present No epileptiform discharges are present Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
