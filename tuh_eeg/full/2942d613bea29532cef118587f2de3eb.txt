CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right handed female with post-traumatic epilepsy
currently seizure-free for many years off seizure medications.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm
with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of
drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and on rare occasions some
theta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does elicit a
driving response.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The background
EEG is rich in beta frequency activity, however, this is not a pathological finding.
