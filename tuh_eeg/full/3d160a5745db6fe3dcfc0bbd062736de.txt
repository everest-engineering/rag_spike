CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old right handed male with past history of epilepsy. The
patient had a seizure one week ago, fell and hit his head.
MEDICATIONS: Novolin, Keppra, Plavix, lisinopril, Carvedilol, Metformin, Simvastatin,
Omeprazole, Ferrous Sulfate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.
Mu activity is identified. There is a very subtle asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic theta
noted in the right central temporal region compared to the left. In addition, occasional
well defined 70 microvolt sharp waves are noted, maximum at T2 and FS. These seem
to be accentuated by drowsiness. As the patient becomes drowsy, some sections of the
drowsy record include a more synchronous background. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
2. Rhythmic slowing from the right central temporal region.
3. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to two previous studies, this is the first EEG
which demonstrated epileptiform activity. The overall background is perhaps slightly
slower and disorganized compared to the previous study in 2007.
