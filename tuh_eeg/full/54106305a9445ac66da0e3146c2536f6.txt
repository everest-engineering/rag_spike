CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since children
with increasing tonic-clonic seizures which can occur in sleep with loss of
consciousness and tongue biting. Strong family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Carbamazepine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 50 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity.
There is a small amount of background theta and a small amount of shifting slowing.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing bursts of frontally
predominant high amplitude 3 Hz to 5 Hz polyspike and wave activity with bursts of
paroxysmal slowing which follow. There are some isolated spike and wave complexes
or pairs of discharges. Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, again
high amplitude spike and wave and polyspike and wave complexes are noted
particularly in the frontal regions with activity exceeding 300 microvolts. Features of
drowsiness include an increase in background slowing as well as POSTS and vertex
waves. The majority of the epileptiform activity is present bilaterally but as the patient
transitions to sleep, there are occasional discharges which may be maximum in the right
or left frontal region. The later sections of the record including just prior to photic
stimulation demonstrate a little less disorganization background theta. Photic stimulation
does not appear to accentuate the spike and wave activity although the spike and wave
activity occurs either pre or post photic stimulation.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3 Hz to 6 Hz spike and wave and polyspike and wave activity
in wakefulness, hyperventilation and early drowsiness.
2. Excess background theta.
