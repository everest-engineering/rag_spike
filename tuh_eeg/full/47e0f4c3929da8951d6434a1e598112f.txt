CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed woman with mental retardation,
deaf/mute, psychiatric history.
.

MEDICATIONS: Thyroid, Sertraline, Depakote

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a symmetric, reactive 10.7
Hz alpha rhythm. In drowsiness, there is very subtle focal slowing in the right central
temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving with harmonic and
supraharmonic driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very subtle focal slowing in the right central temporal region and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today.
Comparison with the patient's previous EEGs may be of benefit. These findings may be
correlated with imaging and clinical history.
