SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background	consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by an asymmetric but reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. The alpha seems to be disrupted on the right, and ·there is occasional right occipital
frontal slowing.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Shifting occipital slowing is seen in drowsiness
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
Focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There·are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm, irregular is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal Awake and asleep routine EEG but does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
For this adult with significant carotid disease but no prior R occipital or parietal infarcts, these finding should be correlated with exam and imaging.
