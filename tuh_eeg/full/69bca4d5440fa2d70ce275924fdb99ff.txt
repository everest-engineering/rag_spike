History:	47 year old woman with an episode of bitterness/ feeling cold/ tired in the setting of
not eating.  Patient has a history of DM.
Medications:	COUMADIN, CYMBALTA, DIOVAN, FOLIC ACID, METFORMIN,ROPINIROLE,
ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
flash rates.  Heart rate of approximately 60 bpm is noted on a  single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minutes EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
