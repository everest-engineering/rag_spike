CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old woman with a 2 week history of episodes of paralysis.  She states that she can't talk or move.  Her eyes are open and she is aware of what is going on.  The spells last 10 minute.  Past history of asthma, dysthymia, DVT, cocaine addiction and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Flonase, Proventil, HydroDIURIL, insulin, Neurontin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This was a routine 20 minute outpatient EEG.  It is technically satisfactory, although there was a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact noted.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In wakefulness, there is a fair amount of chew artifact.  Lambda was noted.
As the patient drifts off to sleep there is an increase in beta.  There is the appearance of posteriorly predominant slowing as well as electrocardiogram artifact and as the patient becomes drowsy there is a bit more head rocking, but a suggestion of slowing in the right occipital region relative to the left.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
HEART RATE 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is likely within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  There were no major abnormalities and the asymmetry noted in the occipital regions may represent head rocking artifact as the patient drifts off to sleep.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged sleep EEG may be of value.  In addition, if this patient is thought to have sleep paralysis, a formal sleep study may be helpful.  Alternatively, consider a 1 hour EEG in the lab with a muscle monitor to look for evidence of reduced muscle tone in states other REM sleep.
