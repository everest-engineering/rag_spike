History:	48 FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SEVERAL SZ POST MVA 25 YRS HIT HER HEAD.
PER PT SHE STOPPED HER MEDS DILANTIN MORE THAN 10 YRS AGO.  EEG
FOR CLEARANCE FOR FOOT SURGERY.
Medications:	Percocet PRN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
