CLINICAL HISTORY:  Paranoid mood disorder with agitation and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Albuterol, metoclopramide, Benadryl, simvastatin and many others.
HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with renal failure, on dialysis.  Intermittent episodes of shakiness with tongue biting. The patient reports that she knows when these spells are coming on and takes Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and drowsy record. Impedances were acceptable with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is generous 13 Hz beta activity noted in the background.  There is intermittent arrhythmic slowing in the occipital regions in addition to the faster frequent activity.  The technologist attempts to get the patient relaxed, but the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic slowing.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Intermittent rhythmic slowing in occipital regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  There is excess beta which suggest that this patient maybe receiving benzodiazepines.  There is intermittent rhythmic posterior slowing which may represent a metabolic phenomena.
