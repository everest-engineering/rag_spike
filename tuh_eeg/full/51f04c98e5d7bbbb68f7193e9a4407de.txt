EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background demonstrates no discernable cerebral activity.
Continuous EKG artifact is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no reactivity to visual,
auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:

Burst-suppression pattern, marked
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute portable EEG due to lack of discernable cerebral activity. This
finding is indicative of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  This
EEG was not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral
