CLINICAL HISTORY:	2 day old infant born to mother with Pres/eclampsia. Significant magnesium exposure. Child initially limp. Apgar of 7, now has increased tone, but is otherwise poorly responsive.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard neonatal montage with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is a 1 hour EEG. The infant is stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial EEG is somewhat suppressed. There is intermittent, rhythmic activity picked up in the right occipital region with a right occipital sharp wave. When the child is resting comfortably, there are portions of the record where it is relatively suppressed. With tactile stimulation, movement is observed particularly  on the right. The child is receiving no intravenous lines. She is noted to have a small amount of scalp edema on the left. The technologist  works to assess electrode integrity. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces a change in the EEG and dramatically produces an increase in activity in the background.
Although there are always concerns bout artifact, there does appear to be a relatively well
defined right occipital sharp wave which waxes and wanes, but does not evolve into seizures. HR:	150 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
1. 	Intermittent  sections of the record which are much more attenuated and suppressed than one would anticipate.
2. 	Right occipital sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The infant's response to tactile stimulation with the reappearance of a more normal continuous pattern for an infant of what is thought to be 35 weeks gestational age are encouraging factors. The sharp waves and the intermittent discontinuity described, the sharp waves may be correlated with MRI imaging. The discontinuity may be part of a sick infant pattern. Ongoing evaluation will be essential. These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
