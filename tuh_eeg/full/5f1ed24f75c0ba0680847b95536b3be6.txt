History:	70 year old woman with a recent right parietal tumor removal, now with an episode
of head turning to the left and left arm shaking.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a polymorphic 7 Hz theta with
weak AP gradient.  Additional polymorphic theta activity is noted over left.  There is no clear PDR
or AP gradient over the right.  The background over the right consists of polymorphic continuous
theta <<delta activity.  Occasional FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is noted, more
pronounced over the right.  Sleep spindles and vertex waves are captured with sleep architecture
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 24 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
continuous right hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal
structural lesion in this region and is consistent a history of right parietal tumor status post resection.
The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
