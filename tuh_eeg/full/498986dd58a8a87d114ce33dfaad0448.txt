MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Gabapentin, Lovenox, Protonix, Hydroxychloroquine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. Vertex waves and spindles as well as posts were seen in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. Normal EEG. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study is advised.
