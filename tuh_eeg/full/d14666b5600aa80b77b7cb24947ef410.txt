History:	71 YO FEMALE WITH COPD AND PREVIOUS SZ HX FOLLOW UP TO WEAN OFF
KEPPRA.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Diffuse EMG artifact is noted during
wakefulness.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EMG
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of Occasional focal slowing in the
left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG artifact during wakefulness.  If clinically
indicated, suggest repeat EEG with sedation.
