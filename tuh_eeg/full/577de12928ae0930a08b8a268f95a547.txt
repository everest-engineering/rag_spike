CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old male with left hemiparesis, epilepsy, alcohol abuse,
right-sided stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Lovenox, Protonix, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed and the patient is relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
pattern of generous beta frequency activity and smaller amounts of theta. There is an
underlying alpha rhythm of 9.2 Hertz but there is some excess slowing mixed with the
alpha. In addition there is a small amount of intermittent, bilateral delta. Features of
drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta. Photic
stimulation elicits a brief driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small degree of background slowing
2. Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features identified. Consider repeat in the
lab.
