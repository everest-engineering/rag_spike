CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old female with change in mental status x1 0 minutes. Subsequent confusion. Past medical history: Hypertension, diabetes, and others.

MEDICATIONS: Percocet.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background alpha is 8.5 Hz. There is an excess theta activity. There is also a left/right asymmetry with better organization on the right especially in the frontocentral regions. There is a mild difference in coherence between the two hemispheres but the frequencies are rather similar. The patient falls asleep during hyperventilation and presence of POSTS is present. During stage 2 sleep, there is symmetry of the two hemispheres. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. The patient is sleeping during this. The asymmetry seen during wakefulness may be related to electrode placement.

HR: N/A

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity. A normal EEG does not exclude the presence of epilepsy. Clinical correlation is further recommended. The background 8.5 alpha rhythm may be impacted with her use of Percocet.
