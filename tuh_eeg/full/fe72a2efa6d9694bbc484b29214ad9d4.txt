Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. awake, hyperventilation. photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity Is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness. the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No local slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed IO< 240 seconds with half cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
