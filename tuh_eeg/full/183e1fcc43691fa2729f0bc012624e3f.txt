CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 36-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis, status post recurrent neurofibroma in lower extremity, patient presented 12/11/2014 with respiratory arrest and collapse of the right lung with coma followed by seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, Lasix, Celexa, baclofen, diazepam, opioids.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was intubated, comatose with occasional whole body jerks, maximum with the abdominal muscles.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilohms, but not exclusively so.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with periods of suppression lasting as long as 9 seconds, but more typically 3-4 seconds in duration.  Bursts of high amplitude activity were noted typically under 1 second in duration was a high amplitude myoclonic spike, essentially obscured by muscle artifact and then some brief beta or mixed frequency activity.  Most bursts were isolated discharges, but some occurred with pairs.
Tactile stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Over the course of the record, the EEG pattern was relatively stable.
Heart rate 95 BMP.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to,
Acute burst suppression pattern for this individual recorded approximately 7-9 hours after cardiac arrest.
Absence of reactivity and/or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the clinical team including the gravity of this hyperacute pattern.  This patient will go on to long-term EEG monitoring.
