AGE: 62 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/01/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE: routine awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1275
HISTORY:
62 YO FEMALE WITH A HX OF ALCOHOL ABUSE, STOPPED DRINKING FOR 2 DAYS. P/W SZ AND AMS. CTH NEG.
PRIOR EEG 2013
MEDICATIONS:
Thiamine Protonix Heparin Ativan
SEDATION: Ativan as above TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of low voltage alpha and a moderate amount of low voltage bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11-12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm
(PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed Photic Stimulation: Not performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 108 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an essentially normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.	Low voltage tracings may be seen in patients with chronic alcohol use.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
