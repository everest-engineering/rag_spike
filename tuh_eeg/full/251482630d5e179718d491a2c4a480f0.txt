History:	33 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Voltages are lower over the right hemisphere but not by more than 50%.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces mild symmetric photic driving
at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This awake and asleep 27-minute EEG is within normal limits. Up to 50% of voltage asymmetry
between the two hemispheres is considered within normal limits.  However, voltages are generally
lower over the left and not right (like in this patient).  Additionally, slight imprecision in lead
placement between the two  hemispheres could result in voltage asymmetry that is seen here.
