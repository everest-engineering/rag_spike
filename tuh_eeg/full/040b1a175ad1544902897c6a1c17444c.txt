History:	39 year old woman with Down syndrome and seizures.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  Patient remains
awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is attempted but patient is uncooperative with it.  Stepped photic stimulation from
1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Nearly
continuous lateral eye movement artifact is present in bilateral frontal leads.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, eye movement
No stage 2 sleep
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal awake-only 26 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Nearly continuous lateral eye movement artifact is present in bilateral frontal leads -
that could mask subtle anterior slowing and epileptiform discharges.
