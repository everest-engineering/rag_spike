History: 40 Y 0 F W/HX SEIZURES LAST SZ YESTERDAY11Â·15-13 WI FIXED STARE,FALL
Medications: Proventil, Albuterol
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy Technique: international 10.20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation. Photic.
Description
Waking background Is characterized by a 25-10uV. 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz beta activity Is present. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent. and tile alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4 hz  activity. and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear
No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect HR is 84 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Normal
Diffuse beta activity
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
