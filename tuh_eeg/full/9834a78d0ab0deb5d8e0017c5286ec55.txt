REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, thiamine, heparin.
HISTORY:  A 76-year-old man with history of GERD and abdominal pain, now confused and disoriented, with lung masses and metastases and left MCA subacute infarction.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient reveals no normal sleep architecture and photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Heart Rate:  114
Abnormal Discharges:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz, amplitude 20 microvolts seen continuously throughout the EEG.
Focal slow waves seen continuously over T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen frequently throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing and rhythmic temporal continuous focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction, over the right mid temporal region which has a high correlation with a structural lesion or an abnormality in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No clear abnormalities could be seen over the left hemisphere, despite the known history of stroke.  This may be due to the overall cerebral dysfunction.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
