CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old right handed woman with Down syndrome, recent onset of seizures in the last month.  Seizures characterized by eyes rolling back, oral automatisms, and poor responsiveness.  Seizures were associated with bilateral hand shaking and lasted 30-60 seconds.  Abnormal EEG at an outside hospital.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamotrigine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is very high in amplitude.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 6 Hz which is higher amplitude on the right and has a more generous field within the right hemisphere.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Drowsiness is characterized by a prominent increase in beta in the frontal central regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are rare, isolated sharp waves observed at C3 and C4 (one of each).  Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.  This was an unusual appearing EEG
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Very high amplitude, slow alpha rhythm.
In this high amplitude record with high amplitude paroxysmal theta, rare isolated left or right central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing is supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as might be anticipated in this genetic syndrome.  When epilepsy occurs in adults with Alzheimer's disease, sharp waves have been described in the frontal or central regions.
