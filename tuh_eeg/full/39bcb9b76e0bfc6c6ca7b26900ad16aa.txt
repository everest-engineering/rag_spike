CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed female with history of generalized tonic
clonic seizures with onset 6/09, last seizure one month ago. Past medical history
psychosis and hypertension.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely
slow with a 6.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Occasional paroxysmal generalized slowing is seen.
Drowsiness is characterized by increase in rhythmicity of the background. In the
sharply contoured background, occasional left temporal sharp waves are observed.
There is a single left posterior temporal sharp wave and one right anterior temporal
sharp wave. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in the background.
Photic stimulation Is remarkable for beta accentuation in the left parietal region.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Background slowing is a nonspecific finding. Could be
due to the patient's medications or any other generalized process and the focal sharp
waves support a focal mechanism for seizures.
