2010, ONSET CONSISTED OF TWITCHING,  AND FALL.  DX WITH LUPUS ABOUT
2 YEARS AGO. FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	TOPAMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to a central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
In drowsiness there are intermittent bursts of high amplitude irregular theta with a slightly sharply
contoured morphology that is not clearly epileptic. These last 1-2 seconds.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The bursts described above are not clearly
epileptic. Please note that previous reports have identified irregular spike and wave as well as focal
slowing which was not seen during this study.
