History:	65yo woman who presents with a history of 2 seizures that occurred 2 years ago, since
then has been seizure free. Patient had another seizure 6/21/15 after not taking her
medications correctly.
Medications:	Neurontin, Tegretol, Oxycodone, Lipitor, Aspirin, others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and mostly asleep. Patient very rapidly
transitions to sleep and is unable to stay awake even with stimulation - please correlate clinically
with an underlying sleeping disorder.
