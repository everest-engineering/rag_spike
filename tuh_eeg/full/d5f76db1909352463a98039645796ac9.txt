CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed man with a history of post traumatic epilepsy after a fall at the age of 18, frontal lobe epilepsy. Patient has auras of facial flushing which radiate down left arm and recent atypical headache.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record demonstrates a well-organized EEG. There is background alpha activity at 10 Hz with 50 microvolt When the patient becomes drowsy, there is some increased theta activity. Vertex waves and K complexes are seen when stage 1 sleep is entered. Photic stimulation elicits paroxysmal driving. Hyperventilation which did not activate the record all that much. Also seen during drowsiness is an increased beta activity on the right as well as an increased theta activity on the left.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG because of:
1. Asymmetric beta and theta activity on the right and left respectively in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen on this EEG. The discrepancy in frontal asymmetry may be correlated with imaging.
