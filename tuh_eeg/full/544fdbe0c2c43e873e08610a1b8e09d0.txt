History:	53 YR MAN WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  PT CONFUSING HISTORIAN. CONFLICTING
STATEMENTS.  MANY SEIZURES DESCRIBED AS LOC.  PT VERY ANXIOUS.
WAS IN REHAB  PER PT STILL DRINKS
Medications:	ATIVAN, DILANTIN, SEROQUEL, ALPRAZOLAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Limited drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
72  Technical difficulties: Continuous eye fluttering artifact seen during most of the study.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.
