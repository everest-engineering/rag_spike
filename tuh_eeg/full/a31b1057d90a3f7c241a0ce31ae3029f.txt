CLINICAL HISTORY: A 30-year-old woman with developmental delay after fever as a toddler.  The patient has episodes of staring, twitching, and aggressive behavior with hallucinosis.
MEDICATIONS: Ability, Cogentin, Haldol, trazodone, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a 22-minute EEG. Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake background EEG is abnormal for an adult of this age. The awake pattern includes 1 of 2 patterns, one of them is a lower voltage pattern with excess theta and a 4 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The other pattern is a pattern with diffuse beta.
It was not possible to obtain sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving response at 9 and 1O Hz. Heart rate: 96 bpm, EKG lead not functioning well.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to replacement of normal background,
primarily with 1 of 2 way patterns, one diffuse beta; two, background slowing with slow posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified . This EEG is supportive of a diffuse, bihemispheric process. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged record capturing sleep is suggested.
