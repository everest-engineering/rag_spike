HISTORY:
A 56-year-old male w1th epilepsy found on the floor in the nursing home unresponsive Past history of chronic frontal encephalomalacia
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin, Lamictal, Abilify, lovastatin.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG 1s performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 1 0-20 system of electrode placement w1th one channel EKG. The patient 1s quite drowsy

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The background EEG IS markedly slow. This is an acute bedside EEG and, as the recording continues faster frequency activity emerges Notable features 1n th1s record Include an initial background of delta and theta w1th intermittent bursts of delta from either hemisphere intermittent sharp waves are observed maximum in the right mid to anterior temporal region, but with variable maximum Some are maximum at Fp2. Others are T4, T2 or F8 stimulation of the patient, as the EEG
continues, again demonstrates additional faster frequency activity, but when unstimulated, the patient drifts off to sleep. There are occasional morphologies of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindle.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A pattern of generalized background slowing
2. Gradual improvement over t1me.
3. Sharp waves seen primarily from the right hemisphere, particularly frontal, temporal and frontotemporal regions
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The patient's previous cranial deformities may accentuate epileptiform activity. This EEG supports a focal mechanism for
seizures.
