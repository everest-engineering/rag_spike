History:	44 year old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 11 years old.  Patient
has 2 seizure types.
Medications:	ZONISAMIDE, CARBAMAZEPINE XR, PHENYTOIN SOD EXT, LAMOTRIGINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of low amplitude diffuse excess beta
activity.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.  Towards the end of the study several spikes
with aftergoing slow waves are captured.  Several discharges are generalized with frontal
predominance, consisting with polyspikes with aftergoing slow wave.  There is ~2.5 second run of ~
2 Hz right anterior temporal (F8/T2 maximal) rhythmic spikes with aftergoing slow waves.
Additionally, several generalized broadly based sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are
captured.  Patient moves her legs frequently during the recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Disorganization
Spikes, right ant temporal and generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 26-minute EEG due to lack of normal organization and several
epileptiform discharges that occur independently over the right anterior temporal region and in the
generalized fashion. This EEG is suggestive of focal and generalized mechanisms of seizures.
However, focal epileptiform discharges could be seen in treated generalized types of epilepsies.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
