LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Almost 24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma status post evacuation, now with a brief episode of right arm shaking several days ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lovenox, multivitamin and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system, additional T1 and T2 electrodes and single EKG lead.
Hyperventilation is not performed and Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9 to 9-1/2 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  This AP gradient is unstable over the left hemisphere.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and focal left hemispheric slowing becomes more pronounced.  There is nearly continuous polymorphic delta greater than theta activity over the left hemisphere that is most pronounced over the frontotemperocentral region.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple fast frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left frontotemperocentral region.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy nearly 24-minute EEG due to continuous moderate focal left hemispheric slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of subdural hematoma status post evacuation.
