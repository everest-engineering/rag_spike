CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, last seizure 3 days ago described as tonic clonic activity with eyes rolling to the left and post ictal confusion.  Past history of frontal temporal craniotomy at birth.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Very discrete right frontotemporal sharp waves are also noted in stage 2 sleep.  As this prolonged sleep recording continues, additional sharp waves are higher amplitude and a little bit more clearly defined from the right frontotemporal region. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing with disruption of the alpha rhythm and the appearance of rhythmic theta identified in drowsiness and relaxed wakefulness as well as sleep.
Right frontal or mid temporal sharp waves primarily noted in sleep.
Rare sharp waves on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG differs substantially from a previous EEG. This was as a longer, sleep study and/or sleep deprived record may explain the more prominent appearance of epileptiform activity and sharp waves. EKG artifact persists into the temporal regions in sleep.  In sleep, there is a single T4 sharp wave.   This EEG is congruent with a structural process on the right as well as a focal mechanism for seizures.
