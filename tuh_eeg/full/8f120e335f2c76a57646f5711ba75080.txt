EEG Type: Technique:


Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. No sleep architecture was present

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is not performed. No tests of reactivity (visual, auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli) are performed. HR 66 technical difficulties: There was almost continuous muscle artifact throughout the study.

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
