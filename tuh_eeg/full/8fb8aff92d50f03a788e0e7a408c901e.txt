CLINICAL HISTORY:  88 year old male who fell down the stairs, found unconscious.  Posttraumatic period of encephalopathy which improved after morphine was withdrawn.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lopressor, famotidine, Protonix, Morphine

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient seems to be a little edgy and startles easily.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  It is recorded with the patient wearing a hard collar.  There are some posterior artifacts and some shifting slowing in the posterior regions but the alpha rhythm is a bit slow, 6 Hz.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in stage II sleep.  The EEG is recorded with the patient sitting up in a chair and snoring awakens him from sleep.  He is somewhat restless when awake.

HR:    66 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Shifting slowing identified in the subject in a hard collar is of unclear significance.  The background slowing is a nonspecific finding and may be due to this patient's medications, posttraumatic state, or underlying CNS pathology.
