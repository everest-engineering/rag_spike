Medications:	Ativan, morphine, Cipro
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
At best a posterior dominant rhythm was seen at 8 Hz.  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
