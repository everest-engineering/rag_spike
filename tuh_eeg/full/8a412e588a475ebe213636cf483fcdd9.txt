HISTORY:
A 28-year-old male with recurrent seizures in 2007, subsequently seizure-free and off seizure medications since 2008.

INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In Maximal wakefulness is 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta Mu rhythm was
identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this. There appears to be lambda.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and subsequent slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate 70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No focal nor epileptiform seizures were identified. The patient's previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
