CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old female with memory loss, epilepsy, right intracerebral hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Ultram, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm. In the transition to drowsiness there is subtle slowing with a little bit of arrhythmic theta and drop out of faster frequency activity. In stage 1 sleep there is a slight asymmetry of vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due:
1. Subtle focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in either this EEG or the one 10 months ago. This study is similar to the first study.
