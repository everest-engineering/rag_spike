CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 40-year-old male with long history of epilepsy, poor historian but recent increase in seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax. Others?

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient appeared to be quite drowsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is asleep with stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, POSTs.  Electrode artifacts were noted in the early part of the record.

In the transition and out of sleep, brief, bursts of rhythmic 7 Hz activity are noted from the left temporal region lasting typically 1 second in duration but on one occasion 4 seconds in duration.  These are seen exclusively on the left.

Hyperventilation serves to awaken the patient, which is symmetric, reactive, 10 Hz alpha rhythm.

Photic stimulation did not specifically activate the record but following hyperventilation, the patient had a brief burst of 3-5 Hz spike-and-wave activity of 1.8 seconds in duration.  This is noted just after the 7 Hz stimuli.

Heart rate is 50-78 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to
1. brief burst of generalized spike-and-wave with polyspike-and-wave activity lasting less than 2 seconds.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic 7 Hz activity describes the left temporal region to likely represent a normal variant such as rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness.  Sleep deprivation or other cause may explain the patient's hypersomnolence.  The generalized spike-and-wave activity suggest a generalized mechanism for epilepsy and has been seen in previous studies.
