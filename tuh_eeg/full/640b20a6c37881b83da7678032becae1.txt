History:	72 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O PULMONARY HTN, DVT/PE, CAD P/W
SOB, COUGHING FITS LASTING 5 MIN. PLACED ON BI-PAP IN ED- RESISTANT
TACHYPNEA AS WELL AS INCREA WOB. R/O SZ S/P PEA ARREST LASTING 2
MIN. NOTED WITH MYOCLONIC JERKING
Medications:	VASOPRESSIN, EPINEPHRINE, MIDAZOLAM OFF for ~50 minutes
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse almost
complete attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
There were very infrequent bursts of diffuse frontally predominant very low voltage (<20uV) theta
(~6HZ) activity occurring for 2-3 seconds. These bursts where at times asymmetric.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84 on single lead EKG.  Technical issues: Vecuronium was used
due to marked diffuse myogenic artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, nearly continuous, severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background attenuation and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which
may be due at least in part to medication effect.
