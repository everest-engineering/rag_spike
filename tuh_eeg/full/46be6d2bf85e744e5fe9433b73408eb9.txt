CLINICAL HISTORY: A 56-year-old male with left frontal stroke, found down, requiring
ICU care for recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, methadone, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, slow, with
generous beta activity. There Is some shifting slowing observed. There is also some
occipitally predominant slowing noted and bursts of FIRDA, as well as some shifting
FIRDA On occasion the frontal stowing is a bit more remarkable on the left.
Heart rate: 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern rich with beta.
2. Shifting slowing , a bit more slow on the left.
3. Disorganized background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. Medications, such as benzodiazepines, could produce the beta activity
described above. No epileptiform features were noted. To further characterize
epilepsy, a repeat study in the lab when the patient recovers may be helpful.
