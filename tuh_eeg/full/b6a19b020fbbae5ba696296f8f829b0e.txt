History:	69 year old woman with change in mental status.
Medications:	Oxycodone and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists primarily of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta
activity.  Rarely, with stimulation, PDR reaches 9 Hz.  The AP gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse
admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  Occasional brief bursts of
frontally predominant diffuse delta activity are noted (FIRDA).
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior temporal region during wakefulness.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left temporal, anterior
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), occasional
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing and
intermittent moderate left anterior-temporal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing indicative of mild to
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing
is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural
in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~120 bpm.
