History:	57 YR MALE FOUND UNRESP.  FOUND TO HAVE PONTINE HEMOR WITH
NONCOMMUNICATION HYDROCEPHALY S/P EVD.  PT BREATHES OVER VENT AND
COUGH NOTHING ELSE NEURO EVAL
Medications:	VERSED DRIP, PROTONIX, LISINOPRIL, LIBRIUM,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. This occurs in burst that have and interburst interval of 1-3 seconds.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Burst-suppression pattern
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing, absent alpha rhythm and burst
suppression.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction which may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No clinical or electrographic
