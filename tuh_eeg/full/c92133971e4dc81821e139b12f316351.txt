History:	37 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY, MENTAL
RETARDATION, SCHIZOPHRENIA, ADMITTED EARLIER THIS MONTH WITH
STATUS EPILEPTICUS ( LTM ), FOLLOW UP
Medications:	DILANTIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
polymorphic delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There were intermittent bilateral frontally-predominant sharply contoured delta
activity.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional epileptiform discharges in the form of spikes noted in left
frontotemporal region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, occasional, left frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse, disorganized background
Artifact, EMG
Artifact, movement
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing with frontally-predominant
sharply contoured delta activity.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Occasional epileptiform discharges in the left
frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG and movement artifact.  If clinically indicated,
