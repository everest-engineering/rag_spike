CLINICAL HISTORY:  45-year-old male with history of bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, alcohol abuse. Nursing home resident.  Occipital scalp scars.  No description of recent seizures, but frequent falling.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Depakote, Zovirax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, diffuse beta.   Scant drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In addition, in this individual with frequent falling, additional evaluation may be helpful to determine management strategy.
