CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old man presenting, was found down unresponsive.  The patient was found to have a large pontine bleed.  Previous EEG showed awake-sleep patterns with diffuse slowing, nonspecific in regard to etiology.
MEDICATIONS:  Folic Acid, Acetaminophen, Pantoprazole, Vancomycin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a very diffuse slow background on both sides, maximum on both frontal regions.  There is a loss of beta activity on both sides throughout the recordings.  The patient appeared to be comatose.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not seem to change the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Diffuse slowing maximum on frontal regions.
Intermittent bursts of attenuation throughout recordings.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse background slowing maximum in the bifrontal regions.
Intermittent bursts of attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG showed a diffuse slowing within intermittent bursts of attenuation consistent with generalized encephalopathy and nonspecific in regards to etiology.  There were no seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
