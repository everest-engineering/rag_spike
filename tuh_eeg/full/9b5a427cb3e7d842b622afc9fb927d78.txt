CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old woman with new onset epilepsy starting 7 months ago with tonic clonic seizures less than 2-3 minutes followed by 3 hours of postictal confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Zyprexa, Xanax

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background is reasonably well organized, but there is an alpha rhythm which ranges from 8-9Hz. Features of drowsiness including increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG is a little bit more synchronous, but the overall alpha rhythm remains somewhat slow. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Very mild disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be due to this patient's medications, epilepsy or other processes. A follow-up EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful and to characterize epileptiform activity.
