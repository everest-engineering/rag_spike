LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of epilepsy who presents with a seizure on 08/06/2013.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and brief diffuse delta activity is observed.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving has multiple flash frequencies.  Lambda is noted during wakefulness.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
