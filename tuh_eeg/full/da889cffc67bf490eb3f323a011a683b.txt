52 YO MALE PRESENTS TO OSH AFTER FALL W/ LOC. WITNESSED GTC SZ IN ED. CODE + CPR. PT CLAIMS FEELING WEAK LAST FEW DAYS. PMHX: VPRF, COPD, HEP-C, DECU-ULCER. FENTANYL, HALDOL, AMITRIPTYLINE, LORAZEPAM, ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, asleep, lethargic
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by an alpha rhythm that at best reaches 8Hz, which attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is during limited wakefulness.  Patient requires verbal and tactile stimulation to arouse.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  The record is mainly in sleep and the patient has a very short sleep latency.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.   Hr was 116  During limited wakefulness the right hemisphere had a diffuse myogenic artifact which impeded a full evaluation of the region.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG mainly in sleep because of mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Please note that the patient was recorded mainly in sleep and this may represent a sleep disturbance or may be related to sedative medications.
