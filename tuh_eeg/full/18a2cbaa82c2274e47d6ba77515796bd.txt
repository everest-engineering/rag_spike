History:	52 YR OLD FEMALE R/O ECS DX SEPSIS PT. FOUND INCREASED LETHARGY
AND UNRESPONSIVE PMHX.MS SJOGRENÕS OSA.
Medications:	MEROPENEM,
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Focal slowing in the central (Cz, C4) region, which at times are sharply contoured.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 110
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral (R>L) central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent focal slowing in the central region.  This finding
is nonspecific with regards to etiology. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
