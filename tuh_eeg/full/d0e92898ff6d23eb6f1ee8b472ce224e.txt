AGE : 69 y.o.
SEX: female
START DATE OF STUDY: 12/09/2015 at 12:06 END DATE OF STUDY: 12/10/2015 at 15:02
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : inpatient EEG TYPE: long term monitoring EEG #: 15-347
HISTORY:
69 y.o. female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to brain and localization related epilepsy referred for EEG for assessment of mental status change.
MEDICATIONS : Keppra, recently increased to 1500 mg q12h SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram {EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
DAY 1 (12/9/2015, 12:06 - 12/10/2015, 06:00) BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous, symmetric , well-organized, and consists predominantly of alpha with admixed beta.
Posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5 Hz.
The background is reactive and variable. Â·
There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude.
There is continuous bilateral temporal polymorphic slowing, which at times appeared quasi-rhythmic.
Sleep was not captured on this day.
Of note the study is grossly contaminated by diffuse lead artifact by 12/9/2015 23:41.
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY {NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
EVENTS : No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single EKG lead captured tachycardia to the 100s.
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Continuous bilateral temporal polymorphic slowing, which at times appeared quasi-rhythmic .
Tachycardia captured on a single EKG lead
These findings are significant for bitemporal cerebral dysfunction and possible bitemporal epileptogenic potential from these regions.
Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
DAY 2 (12/10/2015, 06:00 - 12/10/2015, 15:02)
BACKGROUND : No change
Note that leads were reapplied at 12/10/2015 09:03. Sleep still not captured on this day.
GENERALIZED SLOWING : No change
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) : None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
EKG: A single EKG lead captured tachycardia to the 120s
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Unchanged from Day 1. Sleep still not captured.
FINAL IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Continuous bilateral temporal polymorphic slowing, which at times appeared quasi-rhythmic .
Tachycardia captured on a single EKG lead
FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are significant for bitemporal cerebral dysfunction and possible bitemporal epileptogenic potential from these regions.
There were no clinical or electrographic events reported or
detected.
Tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
Sleep was not captured during this study; leads were contaminated by lead artifact from 12/9/2015 23:41 till 12/10/2015 at 09:03.
