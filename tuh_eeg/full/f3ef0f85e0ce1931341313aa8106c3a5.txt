CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right-handed man with a syncopal event.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Hydrochlorothiazide, Zelia (?), Cozaar. Metoprolol
IMPRESSION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed. This is an awake through stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.
There i s occasional right or left temporal theta but more so on the left. The temporal
theta on the left is at times sharply contoured. Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep
with spindles in stage II. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to: .
1. . Occasional temporal focal slowing with theta/delta left greater than right greater
than anticipated for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in
underlying cerebrovascular disease. No epileptiform features were observed. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing either the patient's
clinical events or additional sleep can be useful.
