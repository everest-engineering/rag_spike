History:	26 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O EPISODE OF LOC (SEEN AT OSH) W/

SHAKING. PT HAS NO RECALL OF EVENT. REPORTED WIT SZ AT OSH,

RECEIVED ATIVAN/VERSED. EPISODE AS LT ARM EXTEND, STARRING AND

UNRESPONSIVE FOLLOWED BY CONFUSION. PMHX SIG FOR PCP, BENZO,

Medications:	No AED, Ativan, Versed OSH

Sedation:

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG

electrodes, drowsy, photic

Description:

Limited waking background is characterized by an alpha rhythm, which at best reached 6Hz

Limited waking background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the

expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  The majority of the EEG was recorded in

stage 2 sleep.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear

diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to

moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic

seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,

tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84

Summary of Findings:

Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse

Interpretation:

This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of a limited wakefulness  which revealed moderate diffuse

background slowing and slowed alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific

indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The majority of the record was recorded during
