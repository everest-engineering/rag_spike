CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 4-week-old infant born at 25 weeks gestation to mother with preterm labor, cocaine abuse, HIV positive, the patient suffered intraventricular hemorrhages.  Previous pulmonary pathology.  Previously hypothermic.  Evaluated for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital EEG was performed at bedside in the neonatal ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The EEG was recorded with the neonatal montage and was reviewed with our standard neonatal montage.  The record captures wakefulness and sleep.  Because of the nature of this patient's fragile medical condition,  the camera was moved away from the patient and tactile stimulation had to be minimized for this patient with fragile hemodynamics status.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This 1-hour EEG captures multiple patterns as would be anticipated in an infant of this age with continuity and discontinuity as well as some active movement.  When the baby is active, the EEG is generally continuous with occasional sharp waves noted from either hemisphere as well as delta brushes.  There may be an excessive sharp waves noted from either hemisphere, left or right, noted independently.  Occasional brief bursts of paroxysmal theta frequency activity were noted, but these are not as remarkable as the initial study.  In quiet sleep, the EEG demonstrates an attenuation without frank discontinuity with periods of attenuation lasting close to 20 seconds.  The electrode positive bursts were noted again in this record, but lasting typically less than 1 second.
Heart rate 150 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 1-hour EEG is remarkable for:
Achievement of some developmental milestones as would be expected for an infant of now 28 weeks.
An EEG that, will not demonstrate __________ frank discontinuity, has intermittent attenuation, somewhat more remarkable than expected for age.
Small excessive sharp waves for age.
Intermittent, electropositive discharges seen primarily from the left hemisphere, which may represent a brief ictal pattern or an electrographic discharge.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to the previous study, the electropositive activity seen from the central and temporal regions on the left is much more constrained and is briefer.  __________ intermittent attenuation pattern is somewhat more remarkable than might be expected for an infant of this early gestational age.
No seizures were recorded.  The brief electropositive discharges in this record seem to be resolving.  This EEG does demonstrate a small __________ and sharp waves in this individual with previous
intracerebral hemorrhage.   A sick infant as described above may have a somewhat more discontinuous EEG as was noted.
