CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 51-year-old woman, admitted with COPD exacerbation. The patient had a rapid response for tonic-clonic seizures with jerking and apnea. Evaluated for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Percocet, Valium , morphine, Wellbutrin, theophylline, Solu-Medrol, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was drowsy and tearful.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a drowsy pattern that is remarkable for both excess beta and excess theta, as well as rhythmic temporal theta.  The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep with spindles. Stimulation of the patient does elicit a brief driving response.
Heart rate: 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The excess beta and excess theta may be associated with this patient's medications. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
