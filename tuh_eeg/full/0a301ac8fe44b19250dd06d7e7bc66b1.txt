CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 78-year-old gentleman, previously evaluated for possible seizures characterized by tremulousness and general malaise, now with episodes of dizziness lasting approximately 1 hour without falling.  History of tremors, stage IV chronic kidney disease, hypertension, heart disease, and shortness of breath.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is medium amplitude with a 10-Hz alpha rhythm and generous low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient seems anxious with frequent eye blinking.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for photoelectric artifact but a scant driving response.  Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features are identified.  The generous beta activity and frequent eye movements may be part of nervousness.  This is similar to a previous EEG obtained October 2012, which was also normal and did not identify epileptiform activity.
