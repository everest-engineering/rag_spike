History:	PT.  FOUND DOWN IN FRONT OF HIS HOME TAKEN TO ED.PMHX NO H/O SZ.56
CM HEAD
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, VALPROATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Very frequent  polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60bps.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of very frequent focal slowing in
the left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this
region, likely structural in origin.
