History:	32 year old female with a with a history of seizures since the age of 16 year old.
Seizures are nocturnal and tend to occur in clusters.  Patient had 3 seizures last
Medications:	Keppra, Trileptal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Frequent 50-75uV, 4-7Hz waves are interspersed throughout the recording.
This activity is similar to theta activity seen during drowsiness.  During  drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 31-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, in this case,
could be related to excessively drowsy patient.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
