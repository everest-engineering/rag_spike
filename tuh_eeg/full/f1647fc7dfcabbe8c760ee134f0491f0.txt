CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old man, who presents with left-sided weakness and altered mental status.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for ethanol abuse and high blood pressure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU setting using standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring, hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed, paraaortic tracing captures, the patient in a lethargic/stuporous state.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In the lethargic state, there was seen diffuse attenuation of the background with generalized slowing consisting of 2-3 Hz delta activity intermixed with 4-5 Hz theta activity.  There is spontaneous variability seen with increase in background frequency intermittently.  There was also some reactivity seen in the form of increased background frequency on stimulating the patient.  Heart rate is 100 to 120 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a lethargic/stuporous state due to diffuse slowing and attenuation of the background activity.  No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to severe metabolic, toxic, anoxic or infectious encephalopathy or a postictal state.  Alternatively it could be due to the effects of sedating medications.  There are no epileptiform activities or seizures that captured during this recording.  It does not exclude intermittent seizures or epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
