History:	45 yr old female undergoing cerebral angiogram and right aneurysm coiling.
Medications:	Induction Meds: Midazolam, Fentanyl, Fentanyl, Propofol, Desoflurane, Vecuronium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Patient is awake early in the recording.  PDR is 11 Hz and normal AP gradient is present.  Once
anesthesia is administered, patient falls asleep with normal sleep architecture observed.  As the
recording progresses, there is general attenuation of the background with some periods of
discontinuity.  It corresponds with increase in anesthetic doses.  There is no change in
interhemispheric symmetry throughout the recording.
Summary of Findings:
Other, unremarkable coiling
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable ~90 minute EEG performed during angiogram and right ICA aneurysm
