CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 77-year-old male, status post right temporal tumor resection, history of atrial fibrillation, now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lovenox, and metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record in a somnolent patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern in a relatively somnolent adult.  The EEG is slow bilaterally with primarily a theta-frequency pattern from the left.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the temporal regions.  Features of drowsiness include some bursts of bilateral frontal slowing as well as an increase in beta in the central regions.
Rare right central sharp waves were noted.
Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
Heart rate:  Irregular, 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with more arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, particularly temporal regions and posterior temporal regions.
Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
Rare sharp waves noted in the right hemisphere, particularly in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous study, this EEG demonstrates significantly more bilateral background slowing.  The epileptiform activity noted in the first study is not as prominent today.  This EEG is more supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy superimposed to a structural lesion may be considered.
