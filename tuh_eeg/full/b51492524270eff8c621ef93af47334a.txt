History:	54 YO FEMALE WITH SZ HX SINCE AGE 9 - 10. PT HAD BRIEF EVENT OF TONIC
LEFT ARM POSTURING LASTING 4 - 6 SEC'S WITHOUT RESPONSE TO
QUESTION AND BEFORE ELECTRODE PLACEMENT. PT DOES NOT RECALL
THE EVENT.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the
central region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from ___ to ___ fps.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of
