CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, 2-3 seizures per
month, last seizure yesterday. Multiple prior EEGs.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra and Lamictal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing
an increase in theta, particularly in the temporal regions, somewhat more so on the left
than the right. As the patient becomes drowsy, there are somewhat asynchronous
bursts in the temporal regions. Typical duration of bursts is less than a second.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. At the close of photic stimulation, somewhat
irregular bursts of theta are observed again, a bit more so on the left than the right.
Some of these are sharply contoured, but there is no definitive epileptiform activity.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Asynchronous bursts in the temporal region in wakefulness and in relaxed
wakefulness early drowsiness and photic stimulation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Definitive epileptiform activity was not identified, but the
activity is sharply contoured in the left posterior temporal region. An additional EEG
recording or recording in sleep may be helpful to elucidate an epileptiform focus. Prior
EEGs were not available at this time.
