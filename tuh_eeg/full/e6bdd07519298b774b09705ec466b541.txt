CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 71-year-old woman presented on the 18th with stroke and vasogenic edema of the brain.
MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol, Keppra, and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was initially obtunded, but was in fact restless if not interactive during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere is moderately so with a mixture of 6-8 Hz activity and underlying delta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm with more of a pattern of continuous arrhythmic delta activity with smaller amounts of beta and theta.  With a brief arousal, there is a glimpse of a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, identified better on the right than the left.  As the recording continues, there is sharply contoured delta with a phase reversal noted at T5.
Heart rate: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
Moderate slowing from the right.
Although there is some head rocking artifact, there is sharply contoured delta noted in the left occipital region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left affecting both gray and white matter.  No clinical seizures were noted.  If additional information is needed, long-term monitoring may be considered.
