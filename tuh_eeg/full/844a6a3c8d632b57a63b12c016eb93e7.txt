History:	45 YO FEMALE WITH PREVIOUS LEFT SIDED STROKE, COILING ON RIGHT
SIDE.
Medications:	Isoflurane, propofol, Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a diffuse 1-4Hz frequency with an almost continuous
overriding 9-10Hz maximal frontal activity.  The faster frequencies are slightly attenuated over the
left temporal and central region.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Incision was at 9:53AM. The first coil
was placed at 10:56:29AM and a second coil 11:19:44AM. No changes to the background were
seen.  The entire study lasted 1:50 minutes.
reviewed the first 60 minutes.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
Other, No changes.
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG during cerebral vascular procedure.
