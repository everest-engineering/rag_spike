CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with bipolar disease, opioid addiction and seizures with aphasia, loss of consciousness, incontinence, and postictal agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Prozac, and methadone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is disorganized with a primarily theta pattern. There are intermittent bursts of irregular delta noted bilaterally.  The patient remains awake and interactive.  By the close of the record, the EEG is somewhat better organized with a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but bursts of paroxysmal irregular slowing are noted, particularly in the occipital regions.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, higher amplitude, irregular paroxysmal slowing is noted with a questionable underlying, posteriorly predominant, right greater than left spike and wave complex.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate: 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background disorganization.
Bursts of irregular paroxysmal slowing.
Questionable underlying occipitally predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's medications may play a role in the pattern described above.  No electrographic seizures were identified.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study may be of value.
