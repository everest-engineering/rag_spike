History:	47 year old man with a questionable seizure.  Patient presented with left arm
shaking with subsequent secondary generalization.  PMH is notable for CHF,
pacemaker, atrial fibrillation, ESRD.
Medications:	Keppra, Xanax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal arousals the background consists of 9-10 Hz alpha posteriorly with preserved AP
gradient.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  During drowsiness, there is increase
in the amount of diffuse theta and delta.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is captured over the right anterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate
and QRS complexes of various morphologies.
Summary of Findings:
Cardiac arrhythmia
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, moderate, right temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 26 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
rare moderate right anterior temporal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Rare focal slowing is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate and QRS complexes of various morphologies.
