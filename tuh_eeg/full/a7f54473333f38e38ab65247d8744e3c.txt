CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old male with adult onset complex partial epilepsy, refractory, tonic-clonic, and secondarily generalized medicines.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory routine EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, but there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Alpha squeak was noted.
Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, spindles, K complexes, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage II sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Low voltage, otherwise normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in the routine EEG.  Additional EEG recording was undertaken to characterize this patient's epilepsy.
