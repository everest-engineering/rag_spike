HISTORY:  A 33-year-old male with 2-3 year history of epilepsy, perhaps, only 3-4 seizures in his life.  Most seizures began with an aura, but recent gastroenteritis with vomiting, could not keep down medicines and had a seizure without warning.  Was noted in the ER to have transient left-sided weakness.
MEDICINES:  Aspirin, Lovenox, Depakote, Topamax, and Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:  1 hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the frequency of the overall background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were seen.  This is a third EEG without epileptiform features noted for this individual.  Of note, at least 1 study was a postictal study, which did identify some background slowing.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged EEG may be of use.
