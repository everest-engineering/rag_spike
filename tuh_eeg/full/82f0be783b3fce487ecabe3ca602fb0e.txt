REASON FOR STUDY:  Intractable seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation due to a complicated pregnancy and hypoxia during birth with recurrent refractory seizures, here for differential.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran and albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7-8 Hz and appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  Overall, the background is slow and does not have normal organization and has intermittent bursts of generalized spike and wave, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded only during wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Bursts of slow spike and wave with anterior predominance and symmetric onset lasting for up to 10 seconds with no clinical correlate seen at 2 to 2.5 Hz intermittently.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bursts of slow generalized spike and wave and diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
