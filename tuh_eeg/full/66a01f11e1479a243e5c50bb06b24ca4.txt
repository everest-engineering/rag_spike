Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region (Maximum at F7-T1)
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of Occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
