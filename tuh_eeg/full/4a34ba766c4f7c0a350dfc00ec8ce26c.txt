CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old female in to evaluate for complex partial seizures. A 33-year-old woman with migraine headaches with dizziness, visual disturbance, short term memory impairment.
MEDICATIONS: Prednisone, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm with an increase in beta and then rhythmic slowing. POSTS are noted in stage I sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through brief stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
