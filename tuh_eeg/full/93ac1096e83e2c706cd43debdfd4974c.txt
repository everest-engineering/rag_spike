CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness or presyncopal.  All occur from standing.  May have associated left-sided headache, prolonged impairment of awareness or bilateral distal paresthesias.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha rhythm which is relatively low voltage, 10 microvolts.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and the appearance of rhythmic theta.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes and spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.  Slight electrode placement symmetry was suggested in stage 2 sleep based on the field of the sleep morphologies.

Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 90 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A low voltage alpha rhythm is a normal finding.
