History:	32 YO FEMALE FOUND DOWN BY MOTHER WHO CALLED EMS. EMS ARRIVED
10 -15 MIN, PEA, IN AMBULANCE, CHEST COMP FOR 3 MIN , PLUS 2 ROUNDS
Medications:	None
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation of activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Intermittent burst of generalized but frontal predominating complex
polyphasic sharp waves at 4Hz lasting 10-20seconds are present.  During this discharges some eye
twitching can be seen on the video.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90.  Please note that there was a diffuse multiple electrode
artifact that affects the interpretation of the background.
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), frequent generalized, Frontal predominant
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges and diffuse
background attenuation with absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are indicative of severe diffuse
cortical dysfunction and irritability, which can be seen as a consequence of anoxic brain injury.
The eye twitching seen associated with the discharges is consistent with myoclonus. The overall
findings along with the clinical history of hypoxia suggest a poor prognosis.  Primary team was
informed about the findings after the EEG was completed.
