History:	65 year old woman who presented with status epilepticus.
Medications:	Dilantin Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 10/09/2014 till 10/10/2014.  NursingÂ­ initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.  All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a mixture of low to moderate voltage theta and delta activity. A PDR that reaches at best ?Hz can be seen over the right hemisphere. No clearly normal sleep architecture is present, but periods of quiescence are noted.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the C3 region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness and sleep. No electrographic seizures are observed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left central No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL -24 hour continuous video EEG due to continuous focal left central moderate slowing and mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing. These findings indicate a structural left central abnormality and  mild-to-moderate diffuse background slowing that is etiologically non-specific. No electrographic seizures are captured. These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
