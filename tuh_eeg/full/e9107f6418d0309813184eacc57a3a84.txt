CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of likely complex partial seizures for several years that have been refractory to multiple medications.  MRI of the brain showing left mesiotemporal sclerosis.  The patient is currently undergoing surgical evaluation for epilepsy surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Lyrica off and Vimpat off.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed continuously.  Video, audio-visual capabilities were implemented.  Spike and seizure detector were activated.  The recording was performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The patient was equipped with the event button.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetric sleep spindles, vertex waves, K-complexes, slow wave sleep, and several __________of REM sleep are captured.  Occasional minimal polymorphic theta activity is observed over the left temporal region.  No events or seizures occurred.
FINDINGS:
No events or electrographic seizures.
Minimal occasional left temporal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal 24-hour continuous audio-video EEG monitoring due to minimal occasional left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  No typical events or electrographic seizures were captured.  When compared to the prior days of the recording, there has been no significant change in the EEG background.
