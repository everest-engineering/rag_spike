History:	23 year old woman who presents for an evaluation of recurrent episodes of bilateral leg shaking/ jerking that can last for minutes. There is no associated loss of awareness.
Patient also has staring spells during which she is aware but unable to move or respond.
Medications:	no AEDs Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse excess beta activity is present. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present. No clear epileptiform discharges are present. Two sharp transients are captured over the right midtemporal region.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges No stage 2 sleep
Sharp transients, two, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL -71 minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. Two sharply contoured waveforms are of unclear clinical significance.
