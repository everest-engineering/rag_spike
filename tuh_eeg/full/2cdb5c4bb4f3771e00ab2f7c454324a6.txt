History:	48 year old woman who is poorly responsive.
Medications:	Propofol - off ~ 24 hours ago.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
The quiescent background consists of low amplitude 7-8 Hz very low amplitude theta activity
posteriorly, attenuated diffuse delta activity and bursts of K-complex-like waveforms.  With
stimulation, diffuse EMG artifact appears and the background is replaced by diffuse attenuated
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Attenuation
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 23 minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  The background is subtly reactive.  When compared to the EEG from 10/2014, the
degree of the background slowing is more severe.  No electrographic seizures are present.
