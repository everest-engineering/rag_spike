MEDICATIONS:  Advair nebulizers, inhalers, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, hyperventilation was deferred. This EEG captured abundant stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  This EEG captures mostly stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The few seconds of an awake EEG demonstrated 9 Hz alpha
The patient is in stage II sleep during photic stimulation.  There is no definitive driving response.
Heart rate 72 bpm, somewhat irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits primarily in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  .  The hypersomnolence noted may be evaluated clinically and may be the result of sleep deprivation.  The irregular heart rate may be evaluated with conventional EKG.
