CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old right handed gentleman with post traumatic epilepsy, 4 to 5 seizures a months, sometimes with an aura but frequently with injury.  Past long term EEG monitoring in 2005 with discreet right frontal/frontotemporal sharp waves but no seizures recorded so far with inpatient EEG monitoring or digit trace monitoring.  Recent seizure on the 26th with fall with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing but a little bit more prominent than the right posterior temporal region.  There is also some head rocking artifact in this region.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate some focal slowing in the right and there is a questionable right frontotemporal sharp wave noted in hyperventilation.
There are rare, right frontal sharp waves at SP2 (2).
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A small amount of shifting slowing.
Subtle right posterior temporal focal slowing.
Rate right frontal sharp waves.
The right mid temporal sharp waves were seen on only 1 occasion and therefore cannot be considered definitively pathological.  The findings described above are similar to previous studies.
This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  Of note, the patient's epileptiform activity was more prominent in the past.
