CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed female with status post generalized tonic/clonic seizures with facial laceration and history of thyroid dysfunction, hypertension, and bulbar cancer.
MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Norvasc, Ambien.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Sleep in stage I and stage II is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and T4, occurring at times in drowsiness but also in wakefulness.  At times they become monomorphic, especially in drowsiness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bilateral anterior temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of intermittent bilateral temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
