CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed male with seizures since 09/11, last seizure last Friday.  The patient is a poor historian with developmental delay.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures includes photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz and appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts seen throughout the recording mainly in wakefulness.
There is a single focal sharp transient seen at F3 throughout the recording which has a morphology very suspicious for a sharp wave, but not clearly definitive, only seen once throughout the recording. In addition, there is some frontal high amplitude and prefrontal sharply contoured discharges that appear to be more benign, but at times have a sharp morphology.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive theta during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards  to etiology.  The single sharp transient
seen in the left frontal region is suspicious, but clearly epileptic.  A repeat EEG with deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in confirming diagnosis.
