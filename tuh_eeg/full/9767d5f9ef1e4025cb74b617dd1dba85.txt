No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
Technique:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory bedside record and included a single channel of EKG, capturing wakefulness only.
EEG Background:
The waking background was characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude was present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements,Â·attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing were seen.
No generalized slowing was present. No focal slowing was present.
Paroxysmal Activity (non-epileptiform):
None
Epileptiform Activity:
No epileptiform activity was present.
Activation Procedures:
none
Clinical Events:
There were no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
Heart Rate:
A heart rate of 84 bpm was captured on a single EKG lead.
Impression:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG. There were no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
Clinical Correlation:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG without photic stimulation or hyperventilation . A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy .
