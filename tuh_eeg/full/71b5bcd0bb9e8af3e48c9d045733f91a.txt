History:	54 yo woman with h/o narcolepsy diagnosed over 10 years ago and reports hx of
seizures but has not had one in years. PMH DVTs.
Medications:	Adderall
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-50uV alpha rhythm reaching 11Hz, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Generous predominately frontocentral beta activity is present.
Wicket activity is noted.  As drowsiness progresses, the alpha rhythm becomes intermittent, diffuse
theta activity appears, POSTS and symmetric vertex waves appear.  No stage 2 sleep is recorded.
Intermittent delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness and hyperventilation.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces a strong symmetric photic driving response.  HR is 90.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information.
