CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old right handed woman, with right sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS:  Procardia, Glipizide, HCTZ, Simvastatin, Insulin, Metformin, Coreg.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background with vertex waves in stage I sleep. Age appropriate occasional bursts of right or left temporal slowing are noted. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.

Heart rate:  72 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The age related findings are not uncommon.
