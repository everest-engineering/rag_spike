REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Cipro, insulin, Famotidine, Zofran.
HISTORY:  A 73-year-old male with complaint of change in mental status found to be incoherent and confused, intubated and given Ativan and propofol last night.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the background is generalized slow at 2-4 Hz with intermittent suppression and an intermixed alpha frequency rhythm that is seen diffusely and at times maximally frontally and occipitally reaching anywhere from 8-10 Hz, in bursts.  There appear to be some reactivity to the EEG as well as some variability frequency with touch.
Heart Rate:  114.
Seizures:  None.
Abnormal Discharges:  Generalized slow waves with intermittent alpha rhythm burst and intermittent suppression.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slow waves with intermittent alpha and burst suppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to the etiology.  However, the intermittent alpha and suppression may be due to at least in part to medication effect.  No seizure or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
