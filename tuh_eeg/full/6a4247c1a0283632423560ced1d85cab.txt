DATE OF STUDY:  09/24/2013 through 09/25/2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman, admitted on September 21st, status post overdose with anoxic insult and prolonged resuscitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Ampicillin, Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Initial impedances were acceptable, but over the course of the recording, electrode integrity was a bit more challenged. The patient was stimulated on multiple occasions during the EEG monitoring session. She remains intubated and unresponsive.  Rare head rocking movement is noted with the ventilator.
Heart rate 126 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:  A markedly slow and featureless background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports severe disturbance of cerebral function.  In the absence of sedative hypnotic medications, these findings, 4 days status post cardiac arrest, are worrisome features.
