CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old right handed gentleman, past history of drug overdose in 2008, hypoxic brain injury with left sided weakness, bipolar disease, memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Xanax, Remeron, Abilify, Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG includes a pattern of generous beta. There is an 8.5 hertz alpha rhythm. There is also 10 hertz activity. There is scant background theta in apparent wakefulness. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in slowing. Photic stimulation does seem to elicit a driving response. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Scant theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record. This is the 3rd EEG for this individual. None have identified epileptiform activity. The other 2
identified more significant excess theta, but the primary feature in this record today is excess beta which may be due to the use of benzodiazepines.
