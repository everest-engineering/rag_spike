INTRODUCTION:
A routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode as well as anterior temporal electrodes. Photic stimulation was performed, but no hyperventilation. Sleep was recorded at stage I and stage II.
MEDICATIONS:
isosorbide, lisinopril and Zocor.
TECHNICAL PROBLEM:
Increased diffuse muscle artifact.
HISTORY:
A 79-year-old female with past medical history of CHF, hypertension, CAD, status post Ml, gout with episode of syncope described as feeling lightheadedness then slumped over the table and was unarousable for 3-5 minutes, back to baseline when regained consciousness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
The record opens to a well-formed 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with 20-70 microvolts amplitude, which is reactive to eye opening. There is normal amount of frontocentral beta rhythm. Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II . Activation procedures of photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges, but no hyperventilation was performed. The heart rate was 84.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
