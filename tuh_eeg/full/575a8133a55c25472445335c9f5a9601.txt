CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45 -year-old male with history of MVA with head trauma, September 2012.  The patient continues to have episodes of floaters spacing out for 10 seconds.  No additional falls.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a relatively high amplitude between 100 microvolts.  Drowsiness was characterized by rhythmic background slowing.  Brief paroxysmal slowing was noted as the patient transitioned into stage I sleep.  Sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.  Hyperventilation produced occasional bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second normal EEG for this individual.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, an additional study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.
