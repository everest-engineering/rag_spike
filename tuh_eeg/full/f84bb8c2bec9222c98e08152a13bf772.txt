CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old woman with multiple strokes and renal failure, admitted on the 31st after generalized seizure, remains confused.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Keppra, Synthroid, clonidine, and Zofran.
ROOM NUMBER:  775B
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was confused, with a feeding tube in place.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It waxes and wanes with a pattern that is somewhat disorganized with a 7-8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and some shifting slowing.  This oscillates between a pattern of higher amplitude, frontally predominant delta and theta.  Some of those bursts with delta and theta are asynchronous, others more synchronous, and some have a frontal sharp and slow wave complex.
At this time, an auditory stimulation of the patient do not appear to activate the record, and during the bursts, the patient is remains impaired.  Tactile stimulation or auditory stimulation when the patient is not experiencing the bursts was not performed.  Versed 2 mg was given towards the end of the EEG.  This produced dramatic improvement in the bursts of slow spike and wave activity as well as an increase in beta.
Heart rate 60-80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 20-minute routine bedside EEG is suggestive of an ictal pattern, although there are strong metabolic features.  There are clearly frontal sharp waves and spikes, and although some features may be metabolic, the paroxysmal high amplitude delta and epileptiform activity appeared to improve with the use of the benzodiazepine.  A 1-hour EEG was performed to follow this response.
