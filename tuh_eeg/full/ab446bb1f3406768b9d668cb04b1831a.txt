CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old female with history of substance abuse, asthma, with change in mental status and staring.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status and staring spells.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the entire recording, the patient continues to move causing multiple electrode muscle and movement artifact and a very limited recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures not performed.  No sleep is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording at 20-60 microvolts.
At times, there is a frontal rhythmic delta and theta seen in sort bursts consistent with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG reveals diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please note that if seizures or epilepsy are still a consideration, a repeat EEG with some sedation may aid in obtaining a better quality recording.  No definite conclusions can be made of this limited EEG.
