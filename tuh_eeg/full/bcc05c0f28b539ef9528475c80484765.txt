History:	52 year old woman who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	KEPPRA, CLONAZEPAM, QUETIAPINE, SERTRALINE, TRAZODONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is captured.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 27-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
