CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old left handed male with headaches associated with
cold sweats, left-sided weakness worse over the last 6 months.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm
which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Hyperventilation is performed early on
in the record producing an increase in amplitude and a small amount of slowing and
some movement artifact. This is followed by a drowsy pattern with rhythmic central theta
and then intermittent arousals from sleep. There is some snore artifact noted as the
patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed when the
patient is drifting off to sleep and does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no focal nor epileptiform features noted,
however, snoring and snore arousals were observed.
