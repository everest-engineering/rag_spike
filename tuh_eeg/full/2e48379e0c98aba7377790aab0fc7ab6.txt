History:	43 YO WOMAN WHO HAD AN EPISODE OF PASSING OUT. PT DOES NOT
REMEMBER THIS EVENT. AFTERWARDS SHE WAS CONFUSED. NO SHAKING
WAS SEEN. UNKNOWN DURATION. HX OF MIGRAINE. DAUGHTER AND MOTHER
HAVE EPILEPSY
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  A marked mu rhythm is seen on the left.  Alpha rhythm and background
activity are low voltage (10-25uV), but show normal reactivity to eye opening and attenuate with
drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, mild, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
