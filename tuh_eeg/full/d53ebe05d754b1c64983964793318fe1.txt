History:	33 year old man who had a syncopal event in 3/2015 at an OSH.  Work-up
reportedly normal except for an EEG.  So patient was placed on Keppra as a result
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces bursts of
moderate-to-high amplitude frontally predominant monormophic theta activity.  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Several brief bursts of
diffuse monomorphic diffuse theta activity are captured during hyperventilation and drowsiness.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2, brief
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Bursts of diffuse theta activity likely
represent drowsiness and are benign.
