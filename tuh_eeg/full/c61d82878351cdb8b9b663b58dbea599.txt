CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old woman with history of aneurysm resection, hypertension, TIA, epilepsy. Four previous brain surgeries and some form of thrombosis. Left-sided weakness. Evaluate for new cerebrovascular event. Bilateral aneurysm clips.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Essentially continuous focal slowing is identified from the right temporal region with right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes and sharp and slow wave complexes. There are 3 left anterior temporal sharp waves. The breech rhythm is most prominent in the right temporal region and to some extent the left frontal region. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in focal slowing on the right.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Few right temporal sharp waves.
3. Breech rhythm.
4. Rare sharp waves in the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural process on the right congruent with imaging. A localization related mechanism for epilepsy is suggested.
