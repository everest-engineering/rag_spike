History:	54YR OLD MALE  WITH PMHX OF S/P LT CRANIECTOMY/? DURAPLASTY,
SDH.PRESENTS NOW WITH H/O SZ.
PT TRANSFERRED FROM MCGEE RE-HAB AFTER BREAKTHROUGH SZ AND NOT
RETURNING TO BASELINE.
POST ICTAL 3/3/14 SZ
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some stage changes are noted.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal at C3 region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There are continuous monomorphic left hemispheric
delta sharp waves discharges occurring through the entire record. At times there is an associated
right hemisphere myogenic artifact.  This is consistent with an continuous electrographic seizure.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, left central, Electrographic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, fast, left central, With associated breach
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of focal left central electrographic
status epilepticus. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the left central region.  These
findings are indicative of a focal structural lesion. Lastly there is  diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
