CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old left handed woman with new onset seizures. The patient was watching television and saw a butterfly come out at her, screamed and then had a tonic, clonic seizure. Family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Vitamins.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background followed by rhythmic theta and vertex waves when the patient becomes sleepy. Photic stimulation elicits generous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generous driving response described above is not pathological. No epileptiform features are observed, but if epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study which may be sleep deprived or a 1 hour EEG may be valuable.
