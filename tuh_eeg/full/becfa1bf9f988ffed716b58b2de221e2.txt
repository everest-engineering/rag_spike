History:	64 yr old female hx of meningioma (right frontal), seizure, narcolepsy, headache,
htn. SZ: eyes rolling up, + LOC, shaking of legs and arms for minutes. - tongue bite,
- incont., 4 SZ in 2014. last SZ 10/2014
Medications:	VENTOLIN, NORVASC, NAPROXEN, FLEXERIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  Please note the patient has a history of a right frontal meningioma.
