CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old male, presented in asystole.  The patient has used IV heroin last night, was found gurgling, called EMS, in asystole, coded in ER, had return of pulses for unknown amount of time and then coded again in the ER for approximately 10 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Dopamine, Phenylephrine, Milrinone, Epinephrine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with frequencies at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  There is no normal frontocentral beta or posterior dominant rhythm seen.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  The patient was stimulated during the recording and no clear improvement of frequencies were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves of 5-7 Hz with intermittent bursts of diffuse attenuation seen.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Intermittent bursts of attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The periods of diffuse attenuation are likely induced by cortical damage, although sometimes can be seen due to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
