History:	76 year old woman status post cardiac arrest on 9/15/2015 and subsequent seizure.
Medications:	FENTANYL DRIP (FOR AGITATION), NOREPINEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
During maximal arousal, the background consists of 9-10 Hz alpha activity, expected AP gradient,
excess diffuse polymorphic theta activity and superimposed delta activity.  During sleep, posterior
dominant rhythm attenuates, amount of theta activity increases and EMG artifact disappears.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 25-minute portable EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
