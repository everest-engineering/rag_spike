Description:
Waking background is characterized by an alpha rhythm that reaches at best 7.5, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz
activity.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
Infrequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, few, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
In addition there is  rare focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or
