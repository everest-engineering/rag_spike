HISTORY: Refractory epilepsy for pre-surgical evaluation
MEDICATIONS:  CBZ &  ZON reduction
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software were utilized.  Intermittent problems with the right frontal electrode were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
Background:  The patient continues to demonstrate a disrupted sleep-wake cycle with abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles noted during the day.
Interictal Epileptiform Detections:  Sharp waves are notably rare in this record and can be seen independently from the left > right temporal region in stage 2 sleep.
In addition, on the morning of the 27th, there intermittent bursts of rhythmic left frontotemporal theta were noted.
Pushbuttons:  pushed button twice with no impairment of awareness, no EEG changes (12:49;2:59PM)  However at 12:49? Aura with increase in HR to 90 BPM from 78
Seizure:  A complex partial seizure occurred at 9:33 AM on June  27.  Characteristics of the seizures included vocalization, right hand and face deviation.  The patient had a prolonged postictal impairment and removed all of the EEG electrodes.  Unfortunately, the technologist was adjusting electrode integrity and the video and EEG for this seizure were lost.
Heart rate 70-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 24-hour section of EEG is remarkable for:
Rare sharp waves noted primarily in sleep.
Emergence of rhythmic left frontotemporal theta noted an hour before the clinical seizure.
Aura without clear ictal change but modest increase in heart rate
