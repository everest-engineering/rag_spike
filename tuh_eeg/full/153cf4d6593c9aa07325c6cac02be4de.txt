History:	60YR FEMALE WITH PMHX   OF MENINGIOMA RESPECT 2009. PT STILL WITH
SAME EPISODES AS FEELING ELECTRIC SHOCK IN BODY HAS IT WHEN
ELECTRICAL STORM, ANXIETY.  YESTERDAY LAST TIME.  ALSO STILL
VERTIGO, HEADACHES
Medications:	Topamax, Antivert, Celexa, Elavil, Toprol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive diffuse  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions. This can be seen with a higher amplitude over the left temporal region.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. There is also higher
amplitude in the sleep activity on the left consistent with a breach.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. There is increased beta and higher amplitude on the left consistent
with a breach rhythm.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
50  In the beginning of the record there was continuous muscle artifact at T3.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal
Breach artifact, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and the
known meningioma resection.
