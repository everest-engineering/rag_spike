AGE: 39 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/29/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1424
HISTORY:
39 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for new onset seizure. She was found to have nodular heterotopia on imaging study as workup.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL #3) 300-30 mg per tablet, levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet,
pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet,
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) â€¢ The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is occasional right hemispheric polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Occasional right hemispheric polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of right hemispheric cerebral dysfunction.
