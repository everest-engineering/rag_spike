CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with long-standing epilepsy, now with increasing frequency of staring spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, seizure medications on hold.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring, using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  During this 24-hour section, the patient's spouse thought she had 1 seizure and there was another practice pushbutton.  The clinical description of seizure was impaired awareness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POS.  Brief, probable stage 2 sleep was noted at 2 a.m.
Interictal Findings:  This EEG demonstrates almost continuous rhythmic right temporal slowing with frequent high to medium amplitude, right anterior temporal sharp waves.  Some of which have more of a posterior temporal field spread.  These were noted in wakefulness through all sleep states.
Seizure at 11:37:  The patient is awake.  Similar, focal slowing and sharp waves were noted as were seen in the patient's interictal background.  It is difficult to see that this EEG differs from the asymptomatic sections of the EEG.
At 7:57 p.m.:  The patient is awake, there are no additional paroxysmal changes noted with this pushbutton.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This 3rd day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Ongoing focal slowing and focal epileptiform activity.
A clinical event with difficult to define as differing from the baseline.
