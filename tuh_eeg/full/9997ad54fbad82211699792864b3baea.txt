CONTINUATION
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed on October 17, 2012 through October 18, 2012 using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is restless or obtunded.  He received 1000 mg of phenobarbital.  Levetiracetam and lacosamide were discontinued as the patient's thrombocytopenia was increasing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In this section of the record, the patient is intermittently somewhat intermittently agitated.  There is little in the way of a clear clinical seizure.
With stimulation, at times the theta pattern appears from the right.
Epileptiform activity on this day includes primarily higher amplitude, fast activity primarily from the left central region, more so than the left parietal region.  The record demonstrates intermittent improvement in this 24 hour section with improvement of the background bilaterally, but persistent left central parietal epileptiform activity with fast activity in the parietal occipital region.  The patient receives increasing doses of phenobarbital.  This produces an increase in the discontinuous pattern, but the complex epileptiform activity in the left occipital parietal region persists.  The epileptiform activity is relatively complex, some discharges are maximum more parietal occipitally, others more clearly central.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  None at this point.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  None at this point.
