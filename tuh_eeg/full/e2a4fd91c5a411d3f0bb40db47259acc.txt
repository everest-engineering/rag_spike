History:	58 YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH PMHX SIG FOR  HIV, HEP B. NOW ADMIT W/LEFT
SIDED WEAKNESS UPPER AND LOWER AND LEFT FACIAL DROOP.
Medications:	Levetiracetam and topiramate.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates but is seen
best over the right hemisphere.   5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present with a higher amplitude over
the right hemisphere.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal over the
midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric, maximal midtemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region.
