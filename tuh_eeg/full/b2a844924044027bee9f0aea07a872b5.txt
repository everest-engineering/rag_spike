REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old woman with history of childhood seizures.  Her last seizure was on 11/12.  Per mom, patient has had increasing urinary incontinence and forgetfulness and staring episodes.  Of note, her other past medical history includes agenesis of corpus callosum and right hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Ursodiol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulations were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is in 9-10 Hz in frequency in the posterior region and at times disrupted on the left side.  There is also frontocentral normal beta activity slightly less prominent over the left hemisphere compared to right.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by:  Vertex transient waves and posts.  The stage 2 sleep is characterized by sleep spindles and K complexes.  Sleep elements including sleep spindles are more pronounced on the left side at times.  Photic stimulation caused driving response.  Hyperventilation resulted in mild slowing of background.  There is focal slowing in posterior quadrants in theta range (5-7 Hz in frequency) during wakefulness.  There is no epileptiform discharges noted during this study.  Heart rate:  60-70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional left hemisphere slowing most pronounced in posterior quadrant.
Disrupted alpha rhythm on the left side.
A symmetric sleep elements more pronounced on the left side.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, which may have a correlation with lesion in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
