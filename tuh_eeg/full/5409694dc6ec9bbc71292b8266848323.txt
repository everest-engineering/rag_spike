CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old male with previous gunshot injury to thoracic spine, past history of ATV crash with posttraumatic seizures.  Four seizures since 2009, the patient is unable to describe or provide the most recent date of seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a routine 22 minute outpatient EEG.  It is technically satisfactory with impedances under 5 kilohms.  Frontal craniotomy defects were noted.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  A breach rhythm is noted with accentuation of amplitude of activity in the central regions particularly in the right central regions with beta accentuation.  In addition, there is some underlying focal slowing noted in the area.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing some subtle, frontal slowing with a bit more focal slowing noted on the right and clearly accentuating the breach in the right frontocentral region.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited a scant driving response.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right frontocentral region.
Mild background slowing with slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A prominent breach rhythm was noted which does accentuate sharply contoured activity.  These findings are similar to previous studies- none identified sharp waves.
