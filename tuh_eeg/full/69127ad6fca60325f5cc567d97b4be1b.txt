History:	57 YEAR OLD MALE R HANDED WITH ANOXIC INJURY. POST CARDIAC ARREST
FOUND DOWN. PMHX: HTN,DM
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was muscle reactivity to
auditory stimuli  HR 72  The second portion of the record is obscured by excessive EMG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
