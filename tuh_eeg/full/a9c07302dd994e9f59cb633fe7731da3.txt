CLINICAL HISTORY:  23 year old right handed woman, 30 weeks' pregnant with seizures in 2009 and 2010.  The patient recently restarted seizure medications.  Past history of premature birth herself, prenatal exposure to maternal drug abuse, learning disability and ocular disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, there are a handful of isolated, shifting delta or theta bursts.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in brief sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to
Occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no sharp waves or spikes, the "footprints" of epilepsy.  The occasional bursts of isolated focal slowing are nonspecific features and
can be seen in individuals with a preexisting neurological insult.  If additional information is needed, a follow-up EEG capturing sleep is suggested.
