History:	66 YR MALE WITH PULMONARY FIBROSIS ON BIPAP.  PT WITH CC OF
SYNCOPE EPISODES WHICH WHERE INITIALLY THOUGHT VASO.  TODAY WITH
EPISODE OF SYNCOPE ALONG WITH SHAKING.  CAME RIGHT BACK TO
BASELINE PER NURSE.
Medications:	NO SEDATION/ PHENERGAN WITH CODEINE, TESSALON PRN, SILDENAFIL,
LOVENOX, INSULIN, SIMETHICONE, PREDNISONE, SYNTHROID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 108  Technical difficulties:
There was a continuous myogenic and movement artifact throughout the record. The patient was
also on bipap and could not be disconnected.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and short sleep stage 1
