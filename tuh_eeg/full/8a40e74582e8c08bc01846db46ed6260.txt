History:	56 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FALL W/LOC, PRIOR TO PT FELT
LIGHTHEADED/DIZZY. PT PRIOR HX OF SZ. SZ VS SYNCOPE. PMHX SIG FOR
ASTHMA, ETOH ABUSE, COPD
Medications:	Lorazepam, Lovenox, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses,
symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta may be seen in the setting of
benzodiazepine or barbiturate use among other medications.
