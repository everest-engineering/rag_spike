History:	67 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O RT SIDED WEAKNESS AND DIFFICULTY
WITH SPEECH CT SHOWED LT THALAMIC IPH. EEG DUE TO CHANGE IN
MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:	No AED
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was seen to reach at best 6hz intermittently.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse high voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior
to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior and midtemporal region.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right mid and anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition
there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region and  diffuse background slowing .
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
