CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old male with cerebral palsy, microcephaly, profound mental retardation and ocular disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Depakote, lactulose, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake record in a challenging patient.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  The patient was entertained during the EEG to obtain cooperation
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with a mixture of theta and beta.  On rare occasions a 9 Hz alpha rhythm was identified.  Asymmetric eye movements and eye flutter were noted in the record.  In addition, there is a suggestion of intermittent, right or left frontotemporal mixed theta delta.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Challenging but abnormal EEG due to:
A background with excess beta.
Underlying theta noted in the background in wakefulness.
In some sections of the record when the patient is not moving about, there is intermittent focal slowing in the right or left frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  To more completely identify this patient's epileptiform activity a more prolonged study capturing sleep would be necessary.
