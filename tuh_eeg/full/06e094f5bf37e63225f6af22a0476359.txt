CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old woman with a left subdural hematoma, now with encephalopathy. The patient is also noted to have a skull defect on the left.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Cardizem, Labetalol, Cozaar, Metoprolol, Hydralazine, Zofran
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient seems to be very sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly slow, low voltage and featureless. There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the left hemisphere is slower, but slightly higher amplitude with 2-3 Hz delta activity. The right hemisphere has a bit more rhythmic theta. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta, particularly in the posterior regions of that theta with even some alpha is more prominent on the right compared to the left. The patient is examined during the EEG with some success. When unstimulated she starts to drift off to sleep and in sleep there are occasional left frontal sharp waves maximum at 7. Vertex waves and FIRDA are noted in sleep.
HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing.
3. Rare left frontal temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter with a more significant process on the left with much more significant slowing, suggesting a process involving gray matter on the left more significantly. Although no seizures recorded, there were sharp waves.
