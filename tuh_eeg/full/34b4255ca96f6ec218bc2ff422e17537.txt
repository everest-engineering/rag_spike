CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old with a history of status epilepticus post anoxic injury.
MEDICATIONS: Pantoprazole, Mycamine, Heparin, Phenobarbital, Cefepime, Norepinephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG pattern during this overnight recording includes more of a burst suppression or post anoxic pattern with generalized high amplitude activity particularly in the frontal regions. In the first several hours it is possible to see the right frontocentral spike but over time this dissipates really to more of a generalized pattern. Stimulation of the patient does not seem to produce an alerting response.
IMPRESSION: EEG due to:
1. A more typical pattern of a post anoxic pattern with a generalized pattern of burst suppression.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are more typical of a post anoxic pattern and are really more of a generalized pattern at this time.
