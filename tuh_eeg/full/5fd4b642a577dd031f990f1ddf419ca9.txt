REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old man with history of seizures starting for some months with a poor history.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures include photic and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording as well as temporalis muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The hyperventilation accentuated the focal abnormalities that I will describe in the abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and independently at T3 as well as at F8/T4 (left more than right) at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left more than right independent anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction (left more than right), both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
