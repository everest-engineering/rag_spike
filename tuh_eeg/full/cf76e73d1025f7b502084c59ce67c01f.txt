History:	49 year old man with a history of seizures since ~14 years old.  Patient also has a
history of stroke.
Medications:	Phenobarbital and Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The background consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity. The AP
gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess beta activity is seen.  Patient is drowsy throughout the recording.
Symmetrical vertex waves are captured but sleep spindles are not observed.
Occasional generalized moderate-to-high amplitude spikes with aftergoing slow waves are
captured.  Maximal scalp negativity varies from frontally predominant, to centrally predominant to
centro-occipitally predominant.  They appear during  drowsiness and frequently resemble vertex
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, occasional generalized, variable polarity: anterior, central and
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to generalized spike and wave
discharges with variable maximal scalp negativity (frontally predominant, centrally predominant
and centro-occipitally predominant). In the proper clinical context, the presence of generalized
spikes suggests the diagnosis of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy/ idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
