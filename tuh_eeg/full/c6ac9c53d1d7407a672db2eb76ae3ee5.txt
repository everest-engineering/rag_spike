AGE: 114 y.o. Or 55 years SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/16/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: 780A	ICU
EEG TYPE: 95819 24 minutes
EEG #: 15-1367
HISTORY:
114 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for:
55 YO FEMALE P/W SZ VS STROKE. EEG TO EVALUATE
NO HX OF SZ
MEDICATIONS : Lovenox, hydralazine
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening .
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: deferred
Photic Stimulation : elicits bilateral driving EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during
this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
