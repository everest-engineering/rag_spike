CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old female with history of seizures and recent increase in her seizure frequency with headache, shaking, tongue bite and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin.
Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 electrode artifact which was fixed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.  However, hyperventilation did accentuate the left midtemporal slowing which be described in abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in drowsiness and stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T3 occasionally at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts which were accentuated by hyperventilation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal awake and sleep EEG due to left midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
