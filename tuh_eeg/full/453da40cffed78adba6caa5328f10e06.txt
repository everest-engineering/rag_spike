History:
44 YO RH MALE WITH CHIEF COMPLAINT OF DIZZINESS, CONFUSION, UNSTABLE
BALANCE FOR THE PAST YEAR. THESE SYMPTOMS OCCUR AT ANY TIME BUT
MOST OFTEN WHEN PATIENT IS FEELING TIRED.
Medications: NO AED'S
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine. awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. awake. drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
With eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present.. maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
Occasional50-75uV, 100 msec positive sharp transients occur bilaterally over the occipital regions of the
head during saccadic eye movements with the eyes Open. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash
rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate fewer than 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 1 steep
No epileptiform discharges
Other, A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate fewer than 60 bpm.
Interpretation;
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but siege 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically Indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate fewer than 60 bpm.
