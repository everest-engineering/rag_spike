CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69-year-old woman with diabetes and silent left occipital infarct.  Patient has had 1 or multiple episodes of generalized weakness, worsening of baseline visual impairment, and slight confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This was a routine, technically acceptable EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is intermittent focal slowing noted in the left hemisphere, particularly left posterior quadrant with at times disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing, a small amount of shifting slowing, and a slight accentuation of the focal slowing in the left hemisphere.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere, on rare occasions, sharply contoured, more prominent in the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged sleep record in the lab may be a value.
