CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old man with a history of seizures, BPH, and syncope who presents to the hospital with witnessed syncope yesterday when he stood up from a chair.  He started feeling like he was going to pass out, felt lightheaded and was out for 30 to 45 minutes.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Levetiracetam, Advair, Lovenox, Vesicare.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of passing out.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software, patient events, and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta. The overall background has a normal anterior and posterior gradient; however, at times there is a central theta, sharply contoured rhythmic monomorphic theta that continues to appear and disappear throughout the recording, mainly in drowsiness but also while the patient is awake.  This is most reminiscent of a midline theta rhythm, or Ciganek rhythm.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:

SEIZURES:  None.

Episodes or push events:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform discharges were captured. The recurrent midline theta appears to be benign although it's significance in uncertain.
