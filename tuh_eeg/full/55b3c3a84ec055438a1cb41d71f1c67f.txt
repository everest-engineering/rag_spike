History:	29 YR MALE WITH CC OF SEIZURE. GTC, GIVEN 5 MG VERSED BY EMS STILL SEIZED X2 MIN POST THEIR ARRIVAL. POST ICTAL CONFUSION. PT STATES HAD SZ LAST WEEK.  UNCLEAR IF HE HAS H/O SEIZURES.
Medications:  Versed
Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
None
Awake & asleep
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and well-organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, slowing of the background,and attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep transients, including sleep spindles and K-complexes,are symmetric and normal. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
There is no focal slowing. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation,and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. No epileptiform discharges were present. A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
