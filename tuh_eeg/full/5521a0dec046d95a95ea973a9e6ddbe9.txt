History:	87 YR FEMALE WITH CHANGE IN MS.  WAS ACTING LIKE SHE WAS ON PHONE
THEN HEARING KNOCKS ON DOOR AND ACTING STRANGE.  NOW BACK TO
BASELINE.  PMHX: HTN, DM, TIA.
Medications:	INSULIN, ASA, HYDRALAZINE, HCTZ, LISINOPRIL, DILTIAZEM, LOVENOX,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region (maximum at T4)
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of Occasional focal slowing in the right
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
