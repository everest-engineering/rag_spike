CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old male with past history of scoliosis.  Patient was diagnosed with epilepsy 2 years ago.  Seizures characterized by blank stares and a metallic taste and then waking up confused.  Over the last 2 weeks, he has had increasing drop attacks, followed by head turning to the right, shaking tongue and body, and tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient rapidly transitions in between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep.  Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
At the closing of the record, head rocking artifact was noted in the right occipital scalp region.
Photic stimulation was not performed.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
