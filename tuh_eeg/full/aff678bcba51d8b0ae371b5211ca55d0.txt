CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with previous stroke and seizure.  The patient had an episode with shaking and loss of consciousness 2 weeks ago, and currently has spells 1-2 times per month with left-sided drooling, slurred speech, and thick tongue.  Symptoms worsened by treatments with Abilify and Cogentin.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, metoprolol, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine, 20-minute digital EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a technically acceptable routine 20-minute EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkable for a pattern rich in beta and generous theta.  A 10 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm was identified.  The patient rapidly transitions in and out of sleep with an increase in background theta and a small amount of shifting theta.  As the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness, arrhythmic delta is noted with variable maximum, but at times a bit more prominent in the right posterior quadrant.  In addition, disruption of faster frequency activity with the bursts of arrhythmic delta activity sometimes more prominent in the right hemisphere.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving response.  The photic driving response was somewhat more vigorous on the left.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Mild background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
A subtle underlying focality with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right posterior quadrant and a subtly focal photic driving response.
Clinical Correlation:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The focal features described above may be correlated with this patient's imaging and history of right parietal hemorrhage.
