CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old male with expressive aphasia who was found to have a left parietal intracerebral hemorrhage.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Hydralazine, Labetalol, Pantoprazole, Carvedilol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a well-organized pattern from the right hemisphere with a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. The left hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity which is seen at times more in the frontocentral regions but at the close of the record, a little bit more posteriorly. In other sections of the record, particularly in the initial sections of the record, it is much more prominent anteriorly but in some sections it is clearly more prominent in the left central parietal region. There are a handful of broadly contoured sharp waves picked up in the record including T3, F3 and T3 as well as C3. Some sections of the record demonstrate more or less rhythmic delta from the left hemisphere.

HR: 96 bpm and sometimes irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption or faster frequency activity.
2. Rhythmic slowing in the left central parietal region.
3. A handful of sharp waves in the sharply contoured background in the left hemisphere with variable maximum.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter. The rhythmic slowing is more prominent in the central parietal region. No seizures were recorded.
