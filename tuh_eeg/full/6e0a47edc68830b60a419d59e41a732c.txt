REASON FOR STUDY:  Left sided weakness and slurred speech.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old man with history of worsening left sided weakness and previous left sided weakness from an old stroke that presents after a fall on the way to the bathroom and now has slurred speech.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lovenox, lisinopril, hydralazine, Plavix, and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Heart rate 60 with multiple premature ventricular contractures or beats seen on the EKG.
The record opens to a background that is mainly seen in sleep and limited wakefulness at best and he has a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10, but quickly goes into theta slowing.  There is some diffuse beta seen during wakefulness.
Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient goes into sleep, stage I and stage II.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen during limited wakefulness.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate generalized slowing in limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
