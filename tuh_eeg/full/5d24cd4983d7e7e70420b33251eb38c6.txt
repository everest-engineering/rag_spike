CLINICAL HISTORY:   67 year old woman status post code following C-spine surgery earlier today, anoxia, myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Vecuronium, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG at 10:49 p.m. following cardiac arrest earlier in the day.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is a suppressed pattern with brief bursts typically lasting 600-700 msec with a triplet of spikes in that burst.  There is a high amplitude frontal burst, typically a triplet and then a suppressed pattern.  Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A marked suppressed, low voltage background.
A burst suppression pattern with a triplet of generalized spike pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG carries a very worrisome prognosis following cardiac arrest.  If indicated, a follow-up study may be of use, but alternative neurodiagnostic methods may be more important to characterize the anoxic insult.
