CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed woman with schizophrenia, HIV disease, hypertension, bipolar disease with Xanax overdose. Two seizures on 6/28/2010, after Xanax was decreased.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lisinopril, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is anxiously awaiting her methadone during the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a theta frequency pattern with generous 7 Hz activity. In this sharply contoured theta frequency background, with some EKG artifact, there is a suspicious underlying left temporal sharp wave. Hyperventilation produces some delta particularly in the left temporal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of background. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response. Just at the close of the record, this patient starts to transition into sleep with some spindles and then an arousal. The spindle activity is asynchronous, in fact, and is picked up a little bit more on the left but at the midline.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with theta pattern.
2. Left temporal sharp wave.
3. Suspicious left temporal focal slowing and hyperventilation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the sharply contoured background, please consider a followup EEG to more clearly define potential underlying epileptiform activity.
