History:	56 year old woman status post PEA code, now with reported myoclonic jerks
concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~26 hours from 11/10/2015 to 11/11/2015.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of slow low amplitude non-reactive delta
activity.  On several occasions (example 11:31 am), high amplitude brief (<0.2 sec) generalized
EMG artifact is captured.  It corresponds to a very brief head jerks (only upper chest and head are
visualized on the video).  Around 12:26 pm on 11/11/2015 EKG fails to capture any QRS
complexes.  EEG subsequently becomes more attenuated and suppressed.  Occasional QRS
complexes are subsequently seen.  By the end of the recording epoch, no QRS complexes are
visible on a single EKG lead and there is no discernable cerebral activity captured.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, marked, by the end of the recording epoch
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked, throughout most of the recording
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous video ~26 hour EEG due to marked diffuse slowing throughout
the recording with no discernable cerebral activity (and no QRS complexes) seen by the end of the
recording epoch.
