CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old woman with hyperlipidemia, asthma, dizziness, and TMJ dysfunction, now with migraines.  Seizures characterized by pain behind the ear radiating to the left ear with vertigo.  The patient also has dysesthesias in hands and feet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta with POSTS. Brief stage II sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. Hyperventilation produces scant background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study capturing this patient's symptoms may be of value.
