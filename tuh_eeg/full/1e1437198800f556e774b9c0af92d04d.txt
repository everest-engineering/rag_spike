CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old woman, several days status post right MCA stroke with a history of seizures characterized by ocular twitching, now comatose and unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Phenobarbital.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. No clinical phenomena are noted. The patient is stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is slow with a mixture of delta, theta and some beta frequency activity. In addition, there is focal slowing in the right hemisphere with right frontotemporal sharp waves and occasional bursts of 15 Hz beta frequency activity in the right frontal region. Most discharges last less than 2 seconds. Stimulation of the patient does not particularly activate the record. There is intermittent discontinuity of the record.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right frontal sharp waves sometimes frequent in nature.
2. Right frontal fast activity.
3. Generalized background slowing.
4. Periodic, arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function as well as an irritative process from the right. No seizures were recorded.
