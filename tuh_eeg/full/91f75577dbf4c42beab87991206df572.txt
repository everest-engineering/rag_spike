History:	52 year old woman who presents with cerebritis and recurrent seizures.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Versed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 4/24/2014 till 4/25/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of burst-suppression pattern with burst-to-
suppression ratio of ~ 1:1 -1:3.  Bursts contain mixture of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture
is present.
No seizures are noted.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Burst-suppression pattern, mostly 1:2-1:3 ratio
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour continuous video EEG because of mild degree of burst-suppression
pattern that is slightly higher when compared to yesterday.  This finding is indicative of severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this case at least partially related to the medication effect
(versed drip).  No electrographic seizures are present in the last 48 hours.  These findings were
conveyed to the primary team.
