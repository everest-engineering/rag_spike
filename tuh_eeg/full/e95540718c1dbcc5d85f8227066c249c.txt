CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed female with complaints of seizure last year, CVA, diabetes, hypertension, not taking medications for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Zantac, Metoprolol, Nifedipine, Hyzaar, Lipitor, Insulin, Omeprazole, Gabapentin, Metformin, Furosemide, not taking the prescribed Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedure including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5-9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedure was photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 rarely throughout the study.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts and a frequency of 2-4 Hz.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.   Focal sharp waves in the left anterior temporal region.
2.   Focal slow waves in that region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region.  No seizures
were seen.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.
