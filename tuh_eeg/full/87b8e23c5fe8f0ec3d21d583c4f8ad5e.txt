.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old female with abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and change in mental status, initially admitted to the medical ICU due to sepsis versus hypercapnia.  The CT abdomen found fluid collection and status post colectomy in 12/2009, had an episode of shaking, bilateral shoulders for 2 minutes, given Ativan and stopped.  She also has a past medical history of COPD, GERD, hypertension, SVT, and essential tremor.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Keppra, Flagyl, hydrocortisone, Advair, Protonix, cefepime, vancomycin, Lovenox, insulin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while slightly responsive while sedated.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Overall, there is a diffusely slow background in the delta frequency at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously.  At times, there is intermittent triphasic live waveforms which appear to be symmetric and maximally center frontally and at times periodic.
SEIZURES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously.
Triphasic waves.
Heart rate 180, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing as well as triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  However, the triphasics suggest at least a possible metabolic component.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
