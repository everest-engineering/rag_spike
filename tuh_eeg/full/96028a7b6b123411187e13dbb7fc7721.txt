CLINICAL HISTORY:   50 year old woman admitted today with altered mental status, impaired responsiveness, low blood sugar, and possible seizure.  Diabetes, heart failure, renal failure, and asthma.
MEDICATIONS:  Pantoprazole, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a theta frequency pattern with eye blink artifact.  There is a handful of triphasics.  There are some shifting asymmetries and intermittent attenuations in the record.  There is a simple sharp wave noted in the right centripetal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR:    116 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Intermittent attenuation.
Triphasic waves.
Sharp waves in the right centripetal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse hemispheric disturbance of cerebral function and has features of a metabolic encephalopathy.  There is also a focal sharp wave, suggesting a focal mechanism for seizures.
