CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male with hypoglycemia related seizures in July 2009.

MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in tab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. In wakefulness, there is generous background beta. In addition, there is occipitally predominant 4-5 Hz activity, right more so than left. This can be seen when the patient is drowsy, but it is also seen when he is clearly awake with eye opening and eye closure. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and Increases the rhythmic theta. Drowsiness is as described above. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess posterior theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed, however, the occipital slowing was not seen in the most recent EEG and merits clinical evaluation.
