CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old right handed woman with a confusional spell, right carotid stenosis, CVA and hypokalemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Lipitor, Metoprolol, ASA, Protonix
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkable for significant amount of muscle and movement artifact.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz.  There is intermittent excess theta and prominent shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  There are sections of the record with that electrode. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does elicits a driving response.
HR:    90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Background slowing.
Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stage of sleep is suggested.
