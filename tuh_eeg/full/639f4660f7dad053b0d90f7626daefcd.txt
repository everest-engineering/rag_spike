CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old gentleman with right middle cerebral artery infarct
and increasing drowsiness this afternoon.
MEDICATIONS: Percocet, Motrin, Metoprolol, Folic Acid, ASA
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears quite drowsy but with maximum stimulation, there is a brief alerting with a relatively normal pattern on the left
with generous beta. He drifts off to sleep with a persistent relatively featureless pattern
from the right hemisphere and more of a rhythmic theta pattern from the left. Vertex
waves are identified which are somewhat asymmetric. Photic stimulation elicits driving
on the left.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Persistent focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Intermittent slowing from the
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. This EEG
supports a structural process on the right affecting both gray and white matter. The
intermittent slowing on the left may be correlated clinically.
