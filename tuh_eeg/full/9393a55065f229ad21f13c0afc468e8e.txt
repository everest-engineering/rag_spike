CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed male with episodes of loss of
consciousness which improve with the use of Dilantin. The patient, however, denies the
history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is
somewhat slow with an alpha rhythm typically at 7 Hz to 8 Hz. There is a smaller
amount of faster 10 and 11 Hz frequency activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on
in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background. Vertex waves are
identified in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits no driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. This is both a
diffusely slow record and a drowsy individual. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a
repeat study may be considered.
