CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old woman with stroke, pacemaker, multiple medical problems, found face down with shaking. Current diagnosis stroke.

MEDICATIONS: Versed, Dilantin, Agitation, Pantoprazole, Insulin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with lower voltage delta, intermittent bursts of lower voltage beta are noted in the frontocentral regions and have a somewhat larger field on the right compared to the left. The record is intermittently subtly discontinuous. There is significant variability in the record with some sections demonstrating a bit more beta in 1 hemisphere than the other, but overall set time is a little less in the left temporal region. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an arousal with an increase in eye movement and alpha and theta frequency activity.

HR: 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Shifting beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was a single sharp wave noted in the frontal region which is of unclear clinical significance. This was noted at T1. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing as the patient recovers from the ICU is suggested.
