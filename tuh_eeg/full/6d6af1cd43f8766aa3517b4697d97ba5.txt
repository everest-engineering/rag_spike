CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old with congestive heart failure and an episode with lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, dizziness, and syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Lasix, Coreg.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a bedside portable 20 minute EEG, technically acceptable with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient seems to be drowsy and drifts off into sleep with an increase in theta, but with stimulation, the theta drops out.  Generous beta was noted.  Wicket was noted as the patient became drowsy.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by vertex waves in stage 1 sleep.
Heart rate irregular 56 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal bedside EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This appears to be a very drowsy patient, but when maximally stimulated the awake pattern is satisfactory.
