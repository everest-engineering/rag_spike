History:	51 year old woman who had a confusional episode in 12/2014.  Of note, patient
broke her arm during the episode.  An EEG performed at an OSH reported
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left temporal region during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left temporal, during drowsiness only
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL awake and asleep 24-minute EEG due to occasional mild left
temporal slowing. This finding suggests focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin.  However, because slowing is present during drowsiness
only, it could represent patient's normal progression of sleep patterns.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
