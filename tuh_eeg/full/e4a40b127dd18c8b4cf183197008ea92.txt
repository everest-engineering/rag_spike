CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with syncopal episode, found to have embolic pulmonary thrombosis, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Sildenafil, digoxin, and Bumex.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG with impedances under __________ with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  It was recorded at the bedside.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive, low voltage, 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with vertex waves noted in stage 1 sleep.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG will be utilized for this patient's operative baseline.
