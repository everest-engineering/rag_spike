History:	54 year old woman who presents status post cardiac arrest.
Medications:	Versed- off, keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpatient), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 4/23/2015 till 4/24/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is is no PDR or AP gradient.  There are clear periods of arousals and quiescence.  During
periods of arousals the background becomes continuous, increases in amplitude, prominent
polymorphic theta activity and triphasic-like waveforms appear.  Periods of quiescence are
characterized by background discontinuity and bursts consisting primarily of alpha/ beta activity.
No electrographic seizures are captured.  Intermittent left P3/O1 sharp waves and bisynchronous
parietooccipital sharp waves are captured during periods of arousals.
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves
Sharp waves, parietooccipital
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous video 24-hour EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing
and  parietooccipital epileptiform discharges.  Diffuse slowing indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction
that in this case at least partially related to the medication effect.  Degree of diffuse slowing
continues to lessen.  There is focal epileptogenic focus over the bilateral parietocentral regions.
There is clear robust background reactivity.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
