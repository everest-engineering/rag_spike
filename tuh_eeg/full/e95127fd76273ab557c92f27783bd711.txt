CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old woman with a history of episodes of confusion,. speech
arrest. Was previously treated with Keppra which produced headaches and hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS: Topamax.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1'channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background.EEG is slow. There is
excess rhythmic theta with a glimpse of a 9-Hz posterior dominant rhythm but most of the
background is in the 5-6 Hz theta frequency range. There are bursts of irregular theta and delta identified in the temporal regions. The slowing may be seen bilaterally in the temporal regions but it is typically slower on the right than the left. In addition, in this somewhat sharply contoured background there are sharp waves seen independently left or right mid to anterior temporal region. Those on the rightÂ·seem to have a bit more of a posterior temporal low focus. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Hyperventilation does seem to accentuate the bursts of independent or bilateral temporal slowing.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Bursts of asynchronous temporal slowing.
3. Independent right or left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: his EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral
function. Additional recording, capturing this patient's behaviors may be of use.
