History:	35 year old man with a history of seizures since 1999 after a gun shot wound behind

left year.  Most recent seizure occurred ~ 2 weeks ago.

Medications:	Tegretol, Keppra

Sedation:

EEG Type:	Awake & asleep

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG

electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic

Description:

Brief waking background is characterized by low voltage Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates

symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is observed.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz

activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows

to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm

attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate

voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  Intrusions of polymorphic theta and delta activity are seen during brief

wakefulness.  Similar theta and delta activity is noted during sleep.  No epileptiform discharges are

present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and patient falls asleep.

Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at

multiple flash rates.

Summary of Findings:

Other, intrusions of drowsiness into wakefulness

Sleep, stage 2

No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:

This is a NORMAL briefly awake and mostly drowsy and asleep 21-minute EEG. This patient

demonstrates hypersomnolence, please correlate clinically.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on

a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
