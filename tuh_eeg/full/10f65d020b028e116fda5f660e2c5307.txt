History:	56 YO FEMALE. PER PT HAS BEEN HAVING BAD ANXIETY, PAST YEAR HAS
BEEN GETTING WORSE. SHE ALSO HAS BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH
MEMORY. NO HX OF SZ.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  On two occasions during
drowsiness a poorly formed central predominant but generalized sharply countoured discharge was
seen. It is atypical as does not seem to have any temporal field.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The discharge described above have an
atypical morphology and are of uncertain significance. A repeat 1 HR EEG may be beneficial to
better evaluate the nature of the discharges.
