History:	F/U 57 YO FEMALE WITH FOLLOW UP STUDY.
F/U  55YO FEMALE WITH H/O NEW ONSET SEIZURES WITH LOC. LAST ONE
8/11. PMH: HEART DISEASE AND HEAD INJURY AS A BABY.
Medications:	TEGRETOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
