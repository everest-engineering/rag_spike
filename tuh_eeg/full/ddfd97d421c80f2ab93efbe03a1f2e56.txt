CLINICAL HISTORY: A 39-year-old woman with episodic forgetfulness and contusion. Family history of brain tumor.
MEDICATIONS: unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is a technically acceptable record although there is a fair amount of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm noted reaching 50 mV with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized
by an increase in beta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background and a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous driving response.
HR 78BPM
IMPRESSION: Normal electroencephalogram.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were noted. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered .
