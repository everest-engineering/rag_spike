REASON FOR STUDY:  History of anoxic brain injury.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.

HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old man with a history of a left stroke and seizures, as well as question of anoxic brain injury with a history of coronary artery disease and seizures with followup EEG, recently admitted Dilantin toxicity and changed to Keppra.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, pantoprazole, Zocor, simvastatin, Lisinopril, metformin, thymine, aspirin, and folic acid.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.

HEART RATE:  60.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves seen very frequently at F7, T3 at a frequency of 2-5 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
2. Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T4 and a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent left anterior temporal focal slowing and occasional right mid-temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal, as well as the right mid-temporal region, both were nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  This EEG is not much different than the one in 05/22/2012 where there was some left hemisphere slowing or the one on 12/14/2011 where there was focal slow waves at T3 and sharp waves at F7, T3.  Again, no sharp waves were seen today.
