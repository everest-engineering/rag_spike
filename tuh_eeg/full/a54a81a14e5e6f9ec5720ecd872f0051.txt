CLINICAL HISTORY:  71  year old right handed woman with cognitive problems and episodes of hypotension.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Insulin, Metformin, Prandin, Labetalol, Protonix, Zocor, Reglan
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, but well organized with 9  Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of blow voltage fronto-central beta activity. Occasional mixed theta and delta is observed
in the temporal regions, right greater than left. Features of drowsiness include slow­
rolling eye movements.   Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 	78  bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is just outside of the range of normal for a subject of this age due to somewhat more than expected temporal slowing from the right. A subject of this age is permitted a small amount of temporal slowing; however, there is a bit more observed from the right than the left and some of it  occurs with a bit more of a sustained beat of 4 Hz pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted. The temporal changes described above are nonspecific and can be seen in cerebrovascular disease.
·If additional events occur, additional EEG monitoring in search of epileptiform activity may be considered.
