:
History:	54 year old woman with a sleep disorder and migraines.
Medications:	Meloxicam, Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional independent bursts of polymorphic theta activity are noted over the bitemporal regions.
These bursts have appearance similar to the activity noted during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at various flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is probably NORMAL awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG. Independent bursts of bitemporal
slowing likely represent intrusions of drowsiness into wakefulness rather than true focal bitemporal
slowing.  A repeat EEG with more prolonged sleep may be of benefit.  Excessive beta activity could
be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
