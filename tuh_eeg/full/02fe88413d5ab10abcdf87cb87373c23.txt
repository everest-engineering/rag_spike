Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal
slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal
region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces symmetric
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent independent focal
slowing in the bilateral midtemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition, there is FIRDA, which can be seen as
part of diffuse cerebral  dysfunction and is nonspecific with regards to etiology.
