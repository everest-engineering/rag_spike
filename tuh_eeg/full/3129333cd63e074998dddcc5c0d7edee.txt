REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 81-year-old woman with seizures, the last one in 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, ranitidine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures include photic stimulation and produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow wave seen intermittently at F7/T3 and at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
At times these are slightly sharply contoured.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral frontotemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral frontotemporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
