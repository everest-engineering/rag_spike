CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old right handed woman with history of Alzheimer's,
hypertension, old TIA and strokes, who presents with episodes of loss of consciousness with a
fall.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox
REASON FOR STUDY: Change In mental status
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10Ã²20 electrode
placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. Sleep was recorded and photic
stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of at best
8 Hz with 20-60 microvolts amplitude. There is some normal frontal central beta seen. Sleep is
characteristic of stage I. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL
1. Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and 20-60 microvolts amplitude. 2. Slight asymmetry in the faster frequencies with a loss of them over the left hemisphere.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves and slight asymmetry in amplitude over the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION
This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction which
Is nonspecific with regards to etiology. The slight asymmetry over the left hemisphere may be
due to the previous cortical damage from strokes. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen
