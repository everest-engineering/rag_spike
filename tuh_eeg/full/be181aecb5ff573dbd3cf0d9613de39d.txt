CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old gentleman with a long history of multiple sclerosis and CT scans demonstrating chronic prior strokes and status epilepticus earlier this morning.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a nonrebreather face mask, has eyes open but is not very interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a very low voltage pattern with generous muscle and beta. As the recording continues, the patient is a little bit more awake and there is a bit more low voltage theta. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity is identified from either region and there is some sharply contoured slowing at F7T3 and in the right central region CZ-C4. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle and an increase in beta.
HR: 84 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a relatively low voltage pattern rich in beta and theta.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.
3. Rare sharp waves noted from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are relatively simple in morphology and may be correlated with imaging. No seizures were recorded.
