CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed male with new onset seizures, past history of alcoholism, subdural hematoma, craniectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry.  The activity is significantly higher on the right compared to the left.  The alpha rhythm is somewhat slow bilaterally, approximately 7-8 Hz.  There is excess theta.  There are some bursts of sharply contoured slowing and a handful of simple sharp waves in the left midtemporal region.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right than the left.
A second asymmetry which includes a little bit more slowing and attenuation of activity on the left.
A handful of simple sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with history and imaging.  A subdural hematoma and/or trauma with craniotomy can produce the asymmetry described above.
