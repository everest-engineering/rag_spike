CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system, additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man with prior episodes of nodding off and waking up with slurred speech.  The patient was not aware of these episodes.  Last such event was in July of 2012.  After he was started on Keppra, it appears that these episodes have resolved.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with fast frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is present.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates,  diffuse theta is observed and symmetrical vertex waves are noted.  Hyperventilation results in no change in background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flesh frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate fewer than 60 beats a minute.

FINDINGS:
1. No epileptiform discharges.
2. No stage II sleep.
3. Excess Beta

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 23-minute EKG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Heart rate fewer than 60 beats a minute is observed occasionally on a single EKG lead.
