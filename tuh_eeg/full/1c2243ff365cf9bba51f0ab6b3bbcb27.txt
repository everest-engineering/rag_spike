CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old right-handed woman, status post MVA with head injury 9 years ago.  Previously treated with carbamazepine for generalized seizures, seizure at the end of the last month.
MEDICATIONS:  Prozac, Seroquel, and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.  Hyperventilation was characterized by head rocking artifact.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 3rd normal EEG for this young adult.  Of note, the patient had 1 of her typical events during her previous EEG on March 4, 2009.  That event was not associated with an EEG change.
