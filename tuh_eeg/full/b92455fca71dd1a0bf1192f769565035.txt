CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed female with alcoholic cirrhosis with new
onset seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Done listed in chart
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep
record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm as
well as a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in. background theta. Hyperventilation produces a small
amount of theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG
does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy, and if the seizure is an important
consideration, a repeat tracing capturing sleep may be helpful.
