CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unknown age female, found down in crack house for about 8 hours with seizure activity, given Ativan in the ER and found to have a left basal ganglia intracerebral hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and an external ventricular drain was placed.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, Ancef, Gentamicin, Morphine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded while agitated.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an asymmetric background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz over the right hemisphere, but it cannot be seen over the left hemisphere.  There is a decreased amount of frontocentral beta over the left hemisphere also.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves continuously seen over the left hemisphere maximal at the T3 electrode at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.
Mild generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left hemispheric slowing maximal in the midtemporal region.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximally in the midtemporal region, which is consistent with the known hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
