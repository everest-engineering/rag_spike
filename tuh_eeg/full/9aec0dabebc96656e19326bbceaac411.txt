CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman with a history of high cholesterol, spinal bifida and asthma who presents to the hospital with a 16 year history of tremens that have become more increasing in frequency lately.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses notes were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which reacted to eye opening.  The patient has normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Patient events:  The patient does not have specific events, but throughout the recording there is intermittent head bobbing artifact side to side with no clear EEG correlate.  At times this gets worse and at times this completely stops.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The episodes of head shaking had no EEG correlate, as such they are nonepileptic and possibly psychogenic in nature.
