CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with hepatic encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: None listed in chart

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Previous EEGs were performed but are not available today.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates moderate background slowing and disorganization, and also demonstrates a markedly slow and disorganized mixed frequency background with arrhythmic delta activity. There are some poorly-formed triphasic waves. While there is no mention of a previous craniotomy, there is an almost artifactual-appearing sharp wave observed in the frontal regions more so on the left. Stimulation of this patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background.
2. Occasional poorly-formed triphasic waves.
3. Occasional left frontal sharp waves which are discrete.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. These findings are nonspecific.
