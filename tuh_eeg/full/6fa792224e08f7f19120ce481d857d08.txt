History:	54 YR FOLLOW UP STUDY AFTER A BREAKTHROUGH SZ AND NOT RETURNING
TO BASELINE 3/3/14.
STATUS POST LEFT CRANIECTOMY, DURAPLASTY AND SEIZURES.REDO EEG
7-7-14
Medications:	Dilantin, Keppra, Phenobarbital, Midazolam, Coumadin, Lovenox, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Background activity is characterized by low voltage attenuation, diffuse delta slow and absence of
the normal posterior dominant rhythm.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged
clinical sleep.
Intermittent polymorphic low voltage delta activity is present in the left hemispheric region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional left temporo-occipital (T5-O1) sharp waves
are present at times in runs of 1Hz for 14 seconds without any clear evolution.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Diffuse EMG artifact is noted during most of the recording.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, left posterior quadrant
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left posterior quadrant
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal EEG due to continuous focal slowing and sharp waves in the left posterior
quadrant region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in this
region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absence of the normal alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
