INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This EEG is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This EEG3 demonstrates a rather disorganized background with a predominant 6 to 8 Hz pattern, occasionally slow with some arrhythmic delta. In addition, the transition to drowsiness, the patient has some posterior delta. Photic stimulation generates scant driving.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background shifting slowing.
2. Some arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Slow, disorganized in the back is nonspecific pattern but is abnormal for the patient's age and it may be due to toxic or metabolic abnormalities in addition to cerebrovascular alterations or dementia. Focal slowing may be associated with cerebrovascular disease or a structural pathology.
