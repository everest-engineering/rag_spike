Medications: NONE
Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes. Awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation

Description:
During short period of wakefulness. posterior dominant rhythm is characterized by a 25-40 uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm. Which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz beta activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions throughout the recording. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows fur1her to moderate voltage 24Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation is not performed. HR Is 60 bpm.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse beta activity

Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect. This is a NORMAL EEG, awake. Drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
