History:	41 year old man status post anoxic brain injury.  EEG is performed to establish ECS.
Medications:	Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Dopamine, Levothyroxine, Vasopressin,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background is attenuated and at 2 microvolts only
demonstrates very low amplitude fast activity and prominent EKG artifact.
There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead
demonstrates heart rate up to ~ 140 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked
Attenuation, marked
Artifact, EKG
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable EEG due to marked diffuse slowing/ This finding is indicative of
marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  In the patient with anoxic
brain injury, this EEG pattern indicates poor chance of neurological recovery.  This EEG was
performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
This EEG does not demonstrate electrocerebral silence.
