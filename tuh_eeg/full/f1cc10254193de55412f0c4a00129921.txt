CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 37-year-old male with a history of epilepsy, but seizure free for 1 year.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Paxil, and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake stage 2 sleep record.  Impedances were general and are 5 kiloohms.  It is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with rhythmic central theta and then vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation produces slight increase in amplitude.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in this record.  There is generous beta noted: this is not uncommon in patients treated with benzodiazepines.
