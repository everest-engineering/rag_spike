CHECK UP.
Medications:	Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz PDR, which attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 65
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
