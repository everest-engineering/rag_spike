History:	58 yo man with recent episodes of dizziness and blackouts. Last episode 10 days ago.
Medications:	Neurontin, Mobic, Oxycodone, Remeron, Tizanidine, Tramadol, Albuterol.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. Regular rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
