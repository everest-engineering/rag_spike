CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male admitted with status epilepticus on 09/06/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy, but
arousable, and as the recording goes on he is asking for water.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG begins with a low-voltage
beta pattern, relatively slow in nature. The patient arouses and as he does so, there is an increase in alpha frequency activity in the background. When unstimulated, he drifts off to sleep and spindles are noted. He spontaneously arouses. Features of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep are noted in the record.
HR: 114 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The excess beta may be due to medications. The
phenomenon of awakening, briefly arousing and then drifting off to sleep may be part of postictal state or due to the use of sedative/hypnotic medications. No epileptiform features were noted.
