CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old woman with post-traumatic epilepsy following head trauma at age 15. Seizures tend to come in clusters and are associated with tonic clonic activity, tongue biting, and incontinence.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm, 30-40 microvolts, drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at 5 Hz and faster flash frequencies. Hyperventilation elicits an increase in theta.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this
record, A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
