CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old male with developmental disability and epilepsy.  Three seizures per month, last October 18th.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, lovastatin, Norvasc, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was attempted, but not completed at the patient's request.  Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The waking background is intermittently interrupted by rhythmic theta which can be diffuse, frontocentral bilateral.  There are also shifting asymmetries noted.  The patient transitions rapidly in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  In the transition in and out of sleep, rare mu activity was identified.  There is also some sharply contoured slowing in the frontocentral regions bilaterally.

Photic stimulation is performed as the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.  Scant driving was noted.  Heart rate 84 BPM with occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Intermittent excess theta.
2. Mild background disorganization.
3. Occasional bursts of frontally predominant sharply contoured slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This individual had difficult relaxing during the study.  If additional information is needed to localize this patient's epilepsy, a more prolonged sleep study may be considered.  Additional evaluation for this patient's PVCs may be warranted.
