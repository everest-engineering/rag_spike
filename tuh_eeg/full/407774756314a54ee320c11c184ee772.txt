CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed female, college athlete with 2 syncopal like events. Childhood history of febrile convulsions which resolved at age 2.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record in a very drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low voltage 11 hertz alpha rhythm. The drowsy pattern includes rhythmic eye movement and more of a theta pattern. Hyperventilation is characterized by rhythmic theta and eye blink artifact. Deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves, rhythmic theta and then arousal. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity. The alpha is not particularly vigorous. There are minor technical issues. If there are any additional questions, a follow up EEG may be considered.
