CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old with epilepsy since age 12.  Most seizures occur during sleep.  Seizures are usually tonic-clonic with postictal confusion, but 3 weeks ago, she had an episode of tongue biting, shaking, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a scant amount of background theta and a scant amount of disorganization for an adult of this age.
In relaxed wakefulness and hyperventilation, there are 2 bursts of sharply-contoured slowing from the left temporal region.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Very mild background slowing and disorganization.
Scant excess theta.
Two bursts of focal slowing noted from the left temporal region, one in relaxed wakefulness and again with some subtle focal slowing from the left temporal region noted in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The subtle features described above are supportive of a structural or functional abnormality on the left.  The background disorganization is quite modest and may be correlated with medications and the patient's clinical history.  A more prolonged EEG capturing sleep is suggested to more completely assess this patient for epileptiform activity.
