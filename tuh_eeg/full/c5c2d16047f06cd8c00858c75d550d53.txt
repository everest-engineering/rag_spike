Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low voltage 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Rare abnormal QRS complexes are noted.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to occasional mild left temporal
slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Rare abnormal QRS
