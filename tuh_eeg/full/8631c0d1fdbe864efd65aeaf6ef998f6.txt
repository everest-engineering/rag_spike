CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old female with history of hypertension, CHF, and status post cardiac pacemaker who presents for seizure-like activity occurred about a month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Spiriva, simvastatin, aspirin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, lorazepam, Zanaflex, and isosorbide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 8.5-9 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6.5-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a driving response.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute with pacemaker rhythm.
IMPRESSION:  This is this is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There is no epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were captured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
