CLINICAL HISTORY: A 29-year-old with mitochondrial disease, cardiomyopathy , obesity, and behavioral issues, now with increasing seizures and increasing appetite.
MEDICATIONS: Vimpat, Topamax, Klonopin, Ativan , Carnitor, Ambien , Geodon, Felbatol, Onfi, others.
I INTRODUCTION ON: A 28-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes .
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There are brief sections of the record where is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but other sections of the awake record demonstrate excess theta.  The patient is frequently drowsy with an increase in beta. This is followed by excess theta.  In drowsiness , there are bursts of high amplitude, rhythmic delta.  This is relatively rhythmic and underlying 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity was noted in the brief bursts. Spindles were noted in brief stage 2 sleep.
No clinical seizures were noted. Heart rate 108 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to.
Bursts of relatively rhythmic 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity.
Intermittent paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.
Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern has previously been described for this individual.  No clinical seizures were noted. Overall, given the presence of a well-defined alpha rhythm today, this EEG is improved compared to others.
