CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old male who was brought to the emergency room with staring spells and multiple tonic clonic seizures with eyes deviating to the left.  Past history of alcohol withdrawal seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, fentanyl, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  During the EEG the patient transitioned from being obtunded to agitated and required extubation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins the EEG is slow and low voltage.  It is a relatively slow, low voltage, featureless pattern.  As the patient started to emerge from the sedation, it becomes a bit more technically challenging with a bit more muscle on the left.  The patient then awakens, is agitated, and is extubated.  After this he becomes a bit more quiet and is snoring.
There is a small amount of shifting slowing.
Heart rate:  96 to 116 BPM, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this technically challenging EEG with difficult to evaluate wakefulness, the overall pattern is one of pharmacologic sedation.  No sharp waves or spikes were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study when the patient is cooperative may be helpful to search for epileptiform activity.  Alternatively review of his previous EEGs may be of value.
