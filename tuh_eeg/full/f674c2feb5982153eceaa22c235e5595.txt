CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 68-year-old male with acute renal failure, septic shock, and multiple other medical issues.
MEDICATIONS:  Cefepime, insulin, Ativan (none for 3 days), Solu-Medrol, and thiamine.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was evaluated for unresponsiveness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a very low-voltage pattern.  There are small amounts of rhythmic low voltage, 4-5 Hz activity.  This varies with a slow, 1-2 hertz delta pattern.  Eye movements were noted.
Stimulation of the patient produced an alerting response and the technologist found the patient to be interactive, despite the very slow EEG pattern.
EKG:  66 bpm (not working well).
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Low-voltage pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Contributing factors can include atoxic or metabolic process as well as a diffuse or chronic neurological process.  In that, this patient is more interactive than one might expect in this clinical context, a chronic process may be considered, although the patient is currently in the ICU for acute renal failure.
