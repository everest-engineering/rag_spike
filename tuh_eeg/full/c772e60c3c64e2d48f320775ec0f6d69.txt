REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old woman with history of seizure and memory loss having auras and staring, having the last one a week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  Hyperventilation accentuated the left anterior temporal focal slowing, which I will describe in abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV intermittently throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
