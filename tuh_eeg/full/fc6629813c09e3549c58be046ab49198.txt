History:	62 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O DLBCL ON CHEMO, ETOH
ABUSE/CIRRHOSIS, P/W NEUTROPENIC FEVER X 3 DAYS. NOTED WITH 2 SZ
PER PRIMARY TEAM. PMHX SIG FOR DM, CARDIOMYOPATHY, HLD,
Medications:	KEPPRA, LORAZEPAM, POTASSIUM, ZOSYN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Intermittent attenuation can be seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region.  Periodic lateralized
epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the F4 region at a rate of 1 Hz.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is some reactivity to stimulation
with an increase in background frequencies to the theta range.  HR was 144.
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, right frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs) in the right frontal region these findings are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic
acute focal destructive lesion.  No electrographic seizures are present.  In addition there is  diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
