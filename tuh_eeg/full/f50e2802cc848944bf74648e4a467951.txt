CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed male with Parkinson disease.

MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Lasix, Norvasc, Furosemide, Atenolol, Amlodipine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a primarily sleep record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is in stage I sleep with rhythmic theta and vertex waves. There are occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is relatively sleepy. The background still remains slightly slow.

HR: 60 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is primarily an asleep or drowsy record. Additional testing is important to make sure that the patient is maximally awake, but aside from this, one might consider mild generalized background slowing.
