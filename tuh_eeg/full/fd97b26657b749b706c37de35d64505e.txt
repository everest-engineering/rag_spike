CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  This continuous video EEG was utilized with seizure and spike detection.  Unfortunately, the patient's prosthetic hair was a serious impediment interfering with the electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient had a seizure at 12:34 on April 26, which was completely unlocalized by the EEG, in part due to artifact and then subsequently by the patient's removal of the EEG electrodes during the seizures.
This seizure and its postictal changes were at least 4 minutes in duration.  The patient was eating.  She stopped eating, she was looking away from the camera.  She had automatisms with her left foot and then she looked away from the camera.  For many minutes, either during or after the seizure, she had automatisms of the hands and face with hand washing movements.  She was able to push the tray back from the bed.  She seemed like she was about to fall of the bed, but actually was able to get herself back on the bed.
Random wakefulness and sleep in the hours following, including in sleep, there were right temporal sharp waves noted.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in stage II sleep.
In the additional recording on the morning of April 27, there were a handful of sharp waves on the left, but more significant sharp waves on the right.
The technologist continued to work with the patient, including wrapping the scalp, but with limited success in terms of maintaining the quality of the EEG recording.
