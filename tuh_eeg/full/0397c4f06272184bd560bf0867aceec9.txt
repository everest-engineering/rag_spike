History:	25 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES; SEIZURE FREE FOR TWO YEARS,
MIGRAINES DAILY.  CURRENTLY BEING WEANED OFF DILANTIN ONTO
ANOTHER MEDICATION,
HAS BEEN WAKING UP WITH A BITTEN TONGUE AND BLEEDING.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Rem sleep was seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
various flash frequencies.  HR was 48
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A normal EEG does not rule out the
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
