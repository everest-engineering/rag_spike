History:	64 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that
attenuates with eyes opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present over the left hemisphere, most notably
over the temporal and occipital regions.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal left
hemispheric slowing and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic
stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash
rates.  Occasional 50-75uV, 100 msec positive sharp transients occur bilaterally over the occipital
regions of the head during saccadic eye movements with the eyes open.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric, especially over the temporal
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 41-minute EEG due to continuous moderate left
hemispheric slowing that is especially pronounced over the temporal and occipital regions. This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
