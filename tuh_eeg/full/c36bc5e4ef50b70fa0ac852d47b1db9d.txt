CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old here for left CVA.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, isoflurane, lidocaine, fentanyl, phenylephrine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system during a left carotid endarterectomy.  The patient was recorded during the operation and changes in the EEG were reported to the primary team.  The patient was clamped 57 minutes into the procedure and unclamped about 50 minutes later.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with normal posterior dominant rhythm and frontocentral beta, as recorded on the previous EEG.  During the clamping, there was no change in the faster frequencies.  In 5 minutes, this was reported to the primary team.
IMPRESSION:  Uneventful left carotid endarterectomy.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an uneventful left carotid endarterectomy.
