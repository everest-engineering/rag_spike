CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with seizures since age 16, now refractory to medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Valproic Acid, Lovenox, Depakote, Keppra, Klonopin, Zoloft, Haldol, Terazosin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software as well as nurses' notes and patient's alarms were used to review the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EVENTS:  The patient had 2 events in this recording similar to the ones in the previous day.  The first one occurred at 8:10:43 p.m. and the second one occurred at 11:47 p.m.  Both of them, the body had irregular shaking for minutes with no response to verbal or motor commands.  The patient had no EEG correlate during this time despite being unconscious.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG with 2 episodes of nonepileptic events.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The 2 episodes described above had no EEG correlate, as such it is consistent with nonepileptic seizures.
