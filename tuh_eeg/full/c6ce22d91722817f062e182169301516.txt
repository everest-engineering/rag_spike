CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed female with history of seizures since age 6, now with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Levetiracetam
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  Wakefulness and sleep are recorded.  Activating procedures of hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is mainly in the 9-10 Hz; at times it is faster, but is reactive to eye opening and eye closing.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Activating procedures with no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T3 and independently and T4 at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
bilateral mid temporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with bilateral anterior temporal focal slow waves, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
