CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old right handed female with episode of loss of consciousness, having a strange sensation, falling backward and waking up about an hour later on the sofa with no recollection of the episode.
MEDICATIONS:  Vitamins.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of unconsciousness of long-lasting duration.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
