MEDICINES: Norvasc, labetalol, minoxidil. lisinopril, Depakote, others.
HISTORY: This Is a 69 year-old right handed gentleman with myelodysplastic syndrome and a history of PRES with seizures. Subsequent adverse reaction to Lamictal and then treated briefly with carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing. At the close of the record, during photic stimulation, there Is some artifact, but there is also a suggestion of focal slowing In the right parietal-occipital region. Hyperventilation produces an increase In amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving with the focal
Heartrate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Head rocking artifact.
2. Focal slowing. in this case primarily on the right
features described above.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG Is overall improved compared to the multiple other studies. Following status epilepticus. he had generalized background slowing. The records improved by October 2010 when he had posterior Slowing, right more so than left At this point, the focal slowing is now only intermittent and really only seen on the right.
