REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status and seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old female with history of mental illness, migraines, and seizures who presented to the hospital with 3 episodes of seizures described as tonic clonic and confusion after stopping her Xanax for 2 days.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, phenobarbital, Tylenol, vitamin B12.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, drowsiness, and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of diffuse beta.  The patient is mainly in drowsiness or sleep, stage I.
Hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and at times at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  78 and regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral independent mid temporal slowing, as well as excessive theta in wakefulness with superimposed diffuse beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal regions, but of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In addition, there was evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  The excess beta supports a possibility of benzo or barbiturate use as a cause of the diffuse dysfunction.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
