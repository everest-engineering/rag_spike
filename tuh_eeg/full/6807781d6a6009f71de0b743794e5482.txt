CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed woman with 10 years of tingling in her head which is increasingly frequent.

MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Oxycodone, Diazepam, Meloxicam, Simvastatin, Omeprazole, HCTZ, Fluconazole.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a background rich in beta frequency activity. Some sections of the record demonstrate prominent Mu rhythm although testing is not performed to confirm this. As the patient becomes drowsy, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness is observed. This can be identified from the right or the left temporal regions. Other features of drowsiness include increase in beta. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is finally drifting off to sleep with a scant driving response identified.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Mu rhythm and rhythmic state of drowsiness are normal variants. No epileptiform features were seen. The generous theta may be due to this patient's medications.
