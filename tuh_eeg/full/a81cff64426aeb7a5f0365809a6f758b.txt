CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old right-handed male with diabetes, hypertension, and dysesthesias in the hands and lips.

MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Glipizide, HCTZ, quinapril, simvastatin; others. INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using the standard 10/20
system of electrode placement  with one-channel  EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness  there is an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.   Hyperventilation elicits an increase in amplitude of the background.   Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

Heart rate is 72 bpm. IMPRESSION:   Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are noted.  A normal
EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
