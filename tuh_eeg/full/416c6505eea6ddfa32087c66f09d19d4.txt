CLINICAL HISTORY:  59-year-old male with recurrent syncope.  Evaluated for accelerated hypertension
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and blood pressure medicines.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  The patient is somewhat tense.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is low voltage but well organized with an 8.5 hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm, as well as slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation produced scant driving.
HEART RATE: 72 bpm irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with abnormal EKG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  The irregular heart rate may be evaluated by other mechanisms.
