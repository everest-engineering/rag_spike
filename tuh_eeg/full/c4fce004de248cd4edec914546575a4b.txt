REASON FOR STUDY:  Recent seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old woman with 25 weeks' pregnancy, status post left temporal lobectomy as well as a history of left hemisphere hemiatrophy, nodular heterotopias, anemia, and asthma, who presents with an episode of shaking with the possibility of epileptic versus nonepileptic spell.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Keppra, Vimpat, Zofran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz, which is best seen over the right hemisphere but at times can be seen over the left hemisphere.  There is normal frontocentral beta over the right hemisphere and at times is a little bit decreased over the left.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
1.  Focal slowing seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximum over the T5 electrode.
INCOMPLETE DICTATION.
