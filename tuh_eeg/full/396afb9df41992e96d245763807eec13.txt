CLINICAL HISTORY: Closed head trauma on February 26, 2011. Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intermittent, spontaneous eye blinking, status post code on February 26, 2011 at 20:50 for an unknown duration. The patient coded in the field, had a right frontal skull fracture and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages. He had been experiencing myoclonus prior to the EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated in a hard collar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a medium amplitude mixed frequency pattern with theta. There is some very slow, periodic posterior delta, more so on the right compared to the left. The patient does have spontaneous eye movements which may correspond to the very slow, somewhat periodic delta. Delta is more prominent on the right.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a mixed frequency theta delta pattern.
2. Very slow, periodic occipital delta, right more so than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. Evaluation of the occipital sulcus will be important.
