REASON FOR STUDY:
Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
HISTORY:  A 24-year-old man with a history of seizures, depression, and anxiety, the seizure is described as tonic-clonic with vomiting and loss of consciousness.  This is a followup EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently in wakefulness and sleep at F4 and at times at C4.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F4 and also C4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right central frontal focal sharp waves as well as slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right frontal central region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction in this region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
