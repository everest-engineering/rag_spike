CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old woman with bifrontal meningioma, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, markedly abnormal EEG in recent days and poor mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Labetalol, Hydralazine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is on supplemental nasal cannula oxygen and is responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates an awake individual with a defined 7 to 9 hertz alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm is easier to identify on the right compared to the left. There is also generous faster frequency activity noted in the occipital regions again a bit more than midline and transitioning toward the right central region. Arrhythmic delta activity is noted in the posterior regions. The activity from the frontal regions is low voltage and relatively suppressed. There are a handful of sharply contoured discharges particularly P3. Breach rhythm is noted with some double phase reversing artifact following the craniotomy and this is seen particularly in the left frontocentral region.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Improved, but abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relative attenuation of frontal fast cerebral activity.
2. Overall slow background:
3. Asymmetric alpha rhythm.
4. Occasional sharp waves in the left central parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While this remains a very abnormal EEG, it is substantially better, There is now an alpha rhythm present bilaterally, more so on the right than the left. The EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. No seizures were recorded.
