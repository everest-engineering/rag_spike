Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Please note that the patient has a very short sleep latency.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:

This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Please note that a short sleep latency can be
seen as part of sleep architecture disturbance. A sleep study can be performed to further evaluate
this if clinically indicated.
