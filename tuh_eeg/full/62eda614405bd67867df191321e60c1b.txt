DATES OF THE RECORDING:  01/31/2013 from approximately 8 a.m. until 02/01/2013 until approximately 8 a.m.
TOTAL LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with a history of events concerning for seizures since March 2011. Her episodes are described as metallic taste in her mouth followed by loss of consciousness and generalized shaking that can last up to an hour.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Depakote-off, Clonazepam 2 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the evening.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  The recording was reviewed at least once in 24 hours.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Automatic seizure detection, spike detection were activated.
Nursing staff notes and Medical staff notes were reviewed.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well-formed and modulated 9.5 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is captured.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, slow wave sleep and REM sleep is captured.  Sleep is fragmented.  There were no atypical events captured.
FINDINGS:
No events.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal 24 hour continuous audio-video EEG monitoring.  No atypical events were captured. Excess beta could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
