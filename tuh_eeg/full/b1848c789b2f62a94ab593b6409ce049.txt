History:	88 YR OLD MALE R HANDED WITH DEMENTIA AND PREVIOUS SYNCOPE
EVENT LOC AT DINNER TABLE WITH FAMILY. AT 10 MINUTES OF CONFUSION
HE RETURNED TO BASELINE
Medications:	ABACAVIR, ALLOPURINOL, ARICEPT
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region (left more than
right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
90 and Irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R)
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG for age, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
