CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy in his teenage years, seizure free for 10 years and then recurrent seizures 2 weeks ago. Tonic-clonic seizures after ingestion of beer.

MEDICATIONS: Elavil, Ranitidine, Amitriptyline, Xalatan

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Rhythmic midtemporal data of drowsiness is seen, as is some wicket activity. Despite this, there are 3 left anterior temporal sharp waves noted in the background with clear dramatic change in amplitude relative to the normal variants as well as some after-going slow waves. Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. In addition, one of the left temporal sharp waves is seen in association with the photic stimulation.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the presence of normal variants such as rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness and super-harmonic driving, there are clear rare left anterior temporal sharp waves supportive of a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
