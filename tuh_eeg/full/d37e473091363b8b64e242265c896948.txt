CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 38-year-old male with nerve stimulator, prolonged episode of unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Ambien, Baclofen, Oxycontin, Alprazolam, Elavil, Flexeril, Toradol, Vancomycin, Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was markedly somnolent in the initial hours of the EEG.  The patient was intubated  but later extubated and awake
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of theta and delta.  As the recording continues, the patient is increasingly awake and there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm.
By the morning of the 2nd, the patient is clearly awake with spontaneous eye opening and a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm. On the afternoon of 12/02/2014 at 4:30 PM,  while awake with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm the patient was observed to carefully remove the EEG electrodes
Heart rate: 114 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 24 hour continuous video EEG monitoring for a patient with complex neurological issues was remarkable for:
An initially markedly slow pattern.
The appearance of a normal awake pattern.
No epileptiform activity.
Clinical factors other than seizure may account for this patient's unresponsiveness.
