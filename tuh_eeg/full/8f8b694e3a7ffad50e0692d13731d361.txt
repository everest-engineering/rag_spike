Description:
Waking background Is characterized by a 25-40uV, 1O Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity Is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.

No normal sleep architecture is present No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 Hashes per second {fps) does
not produce any effect. A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
