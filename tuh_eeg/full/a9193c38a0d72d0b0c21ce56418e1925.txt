INTRODUCTION: No clinical seizures were noted by the nurses and none were seen by the computer.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: The background remains diffusely slow and poorly organized.  It is overall a sharply contoured background and there are sharp waves identified in the left frontocentral region, right frontal including FP2, as well as intermittent mixed delta and theta, which may be asymmetric, sometimes more on the left frontal regions and at other times on the right.  There are some portions which seem to be a bit more attenuated on the right.  Overall, there is less in the way of epileptiform activity. Sleep continues to demonstrate high amplitude, sharply contoured discharges and at times, asymmetric spindles, left greater than right.  Overall, however, the amplitude isnâ€™t as high and the overall organization seems to be a bit better.
HR:  78 BPM.
