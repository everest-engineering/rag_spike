CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old woman status post anoxic insult on the 26th, found unresponsive with positive tox screen for cocaine, multiple seizures on the 27th, S/P anoxic insult.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had no additional seizures during the EEG monitoring and no additional sedative hypnotic medications were given.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial pattern demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with fast activity in the central regions and small, discrete spikes in the central temporal regions.  Over time, the EEG becomes lower voltage, slower and more featureless. Muscle artifact emerges at 3 a.m.  By the close of the record, the overall EEG pattern is lower voltage, more featureless.  There are some EKG artifacts observed.

HR:    120 bpm

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring for this adult, more than 48 hours following anoxic insult and immediately following a seizure, demonstrates a pattern of waning cerebral activity.  No seizures were noted.  The central spikes seen in the initial sections of the record had disappeared later on in the study.  Overall, the most significant features were the overall increasing attenuation in cerebral activity.
