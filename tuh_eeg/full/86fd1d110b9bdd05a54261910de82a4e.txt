COGNITIVE DEFECTS. TAKEN TO ED FOR HEMORRHAGE ON CT SCAN. 55 CM
HEAD
Medications:	LOVENOX, DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Asymmetric  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over left
frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the central and
temporal regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of beta
activity with loss of faster frequencies on the right.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right hemispheric, maximal centro temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right hemisphere maximal in the centro-temporal with additional loss of faster frequencies.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region involving cortex.
