History:	61 Y/O MALE L HANDED. SON BELIEVES HIS FATHER IS HAVING SZ. NO H/O
SZ. PMHX. DEMENTIA,DM TYPE, ABDOMINAL PAIN, NAUSEA
Medications:	LISPRO, HEPARIN, LASIX, TRAMADOL, HALDOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  rare focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
In addition there is moderate  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
