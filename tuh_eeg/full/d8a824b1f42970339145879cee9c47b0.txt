CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old left handed female who presents with history of colitis, COPD, asthma, stroke and aneurysm, history of seizures and multiple neuroma now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Famotidine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  No activating procedures are performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and lethargy.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some cough artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7-8 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is decreased amount of frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts which is seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild to moderate generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In this patient, it may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
