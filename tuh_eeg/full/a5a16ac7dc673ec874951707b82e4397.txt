CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old woman with new onset seizures occurring January 28th, found down in the kitchen having bitten her tongue and suffering a 2nd degree burn on the left arm and scalp.  Patient recalls feeling dizzy and woozy prior to loss of consciousness.

MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone.

INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 kiloohms with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta as well as rhythmic frontocentral theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.

Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, producing an increase in the background.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and light sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.  There were no previous EEGs available for comparison.
