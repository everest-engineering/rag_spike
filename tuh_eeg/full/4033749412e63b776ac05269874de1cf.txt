CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 77-year-old woman, baseline study for aortic arch surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient does not recall.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is generous beta.  The patient seems to be very anxious during the EEG and is at times inattentive.  Some sections of the record demonstrate excess theta in apparent wakefulness.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.  In later sections of the record, in wakefulness, the patient was moving about and the EEG was somewhat obscured by artifact.
Photic stimulation did elicit a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 55 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is upper limits of normal for an adult of this age due to:
Background theta.
There is a little bit of shifting slowing and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No significant focal features were identified.  This study will be used for this patient's operative baseline.
