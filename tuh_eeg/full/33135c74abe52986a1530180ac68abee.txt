Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 21 hours from 01/02/2014 to 01/03/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG
was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
There is almost continuous bifrontal focal slow mainly in the prefrontal leads.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (R>L) frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous bifrontal focal slowing. These findings are
indicative of a  focal structural lesion in that region consistent with the known subdural
hemorrhages. In addition there is evidence of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction
