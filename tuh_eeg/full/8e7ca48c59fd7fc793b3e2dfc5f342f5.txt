AGE: 75 y.o.
SEX: male
START DATE OF STUDY: 11/13/2015 at 14:51 END DATE OF STUDY: 11/14/2015 at 10:16
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: LTM
EEG #: 15-322.1-2
HISTORY:
75 y.o. male with a history of CAD s/p CABG, hypotension, and multiple ischemic infarcts referred for EEG for altered mental status, left gaze deviation, and intermittent twitching of trunk/diaphragm and face.
Left gaze deviation was seen by examining consult team 2.5 hours prior to start of the study.
Though no specific notation was made during the study, left gaze deviation was again seen by consulting team 1.5 hours after the end of the study.
MEDICATIONS: VPA 250 mg TIO; s/p Keppra 1 g load, then 500 ql2h on 11/13
SEDATION: s/p Ativan 2 mg IVP given 3 hours prior to start of recording
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
DAY 1 (11/13, 14:51 - 11/14/2-015, 06:00) BACKGROUND:
The background is continuous, symmetric, poorly organized, and consists of a mixture of theta and to a lesser extent, delta and alpha frequencies.
Posterior dominant rhythm is not present.
The background is reactive and variable. During relatively quieter periods, the background consists of delta with admixed theta. Sleep transients are absent.
Spontaneous eye blinks are present.
There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
EVENTS:
Several episodes of diaphragmatic myoclonus are captured on
video, correlating with ventilator artifact on EEG. Some examples occur on 11/14/15 at 00:29, 01:30, 05:25.
CLINICAL: The patient receives a delivered breath on the ventilator and had several myoclonic movements of the diaphragm. EEG: Ventilator tubing artifact (delta wave seen in frontal leads with superimposed fast frequency activity) correlates on EEG. There is no underlying epileptiform activity.
EKG: A single EKG strip captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s. DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Moderate diffuse slowing
Background disorganization
Diaphragmatic myoclonus correlating with ventilator tubing artifact on EEG, without underlying epileptiform activity.
These findings are consistent with moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Diaphragmatic myoclonus is captured and does not correlate with epileptiform activity.
DAY 2 (11/14/2015, 06:00 - 11/14/2015, 10:16)
BACKGROUND: No change GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change FOCAL SLOWING: None
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) : None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS: no change from previous day
EKG: A single EKG strip captured a heart rate in the 80s-90s. DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
No change from Day 1.
FINAL IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Moderate diffuse slowing
Background disorganization
Diaphragmatic myoclonus correlating with ventilator tubing artifact on EEG, without underlying epileptiform activity.
FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Diaphragmatic myoclonus is captured and does not correlate with epileptiform activity.
