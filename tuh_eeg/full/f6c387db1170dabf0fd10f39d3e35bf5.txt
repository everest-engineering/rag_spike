CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old right handed male with numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Diovan, Protonix, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation. There is no photic simulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there was a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm but there is a scant amount of 6 Hz background activity. In addition, there is intermittent shifting, irregular delta activity seen infrequently in wakefulness from either hemisphere.
HR: 72 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
2. Mild background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. These findings are quite modest for an adult of this age and can be seen in underlying cerebrovascular disease.
