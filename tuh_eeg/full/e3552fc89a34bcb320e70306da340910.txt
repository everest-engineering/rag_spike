History:	54 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O RT CVA 8/2005 WITH RESIDING LEFT
SIDED PARALYSIS, SZ 7/21/2008 WITH LOC, HTN, NEUROPATHY.
Medications:	GABAPENTIN, TENORMIN, ASPIRIN, SYNTHROID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA), 2.5 - 3 Hz in frequency, is present on the
right side mostly during drowsiness lasting up to 2 seconds.  Intermittent focal slowing in the right
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), right
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of 1) intermittent focal slowing in the right temporal region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction.  2) right TIRDA. This pattern suggests
potential epileptogenesis involving right temporal lobe. Clinical correlation is recommended.
