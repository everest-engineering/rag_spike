CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old right handed female with microcephaly, mental retardation,
questionable drop attacks.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown, none listed

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.
Some sections are low voltage with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz and some generous
beta and some theta. Other sections include more of a theta frequency background. There are sustained bursts of rhythmic, sharply contoured 5 Hz paroxysmal activity maximal in the frontal regions. Some of these seem to have frequency of late evolution. Some seem to start with a sharp wave in the right or left frontal region. On one occasion, one of these more sustained bursts seems to be associated with startling and the patient puts her hand over her mouth. On other occasions, however, it is difficult to say that the bursts are associated with any change in behavior. The technologist taps the patient during one of the events and the patient alerts and the 5 Hz activity disappears.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An unusual pattern with an almost normal-appearing background alternating with a beta
theta pattern.
2. Paroxysmal bursts of higher amplitude activity in the frontal regions which demonstrate
frequency evolution with 5 Hz activity evolving to 8 Hz and then slowing as the discharges wane.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: I n this challenging patient, the possibility that at least some of
these bursts can represent subtle seizures Is Important to consider. This EEG supports a diffuse
disturbance of cerebral function and the ictal pattern Is one seen in a chronic, static
encephalopathy emanating from a pediatric pattern.
