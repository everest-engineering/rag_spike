REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old man with acute stroke and status post left hemicraniectomy and large epidural hematoma with a craniectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while obtunded.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall the background consists of diffuse slowing with attenuation of frequencies over the entire left hemisphere and focal slowing seen maximal in the left frontal region.  Over the right hemisphere, there is mainly theta/delta frequency at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-60 microvolts, and at times faster in theta.  There appears to be no reactivity to the EEG with stimulation.  At times over the right hemisphere, there are some sharply contoured waveforms at T6 and T4.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Left hemisphere attenuation and focal slowing maximal over the frontal region.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE: 108, rhythmic.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left hemispheric attenuation and focal slowing maximal in the frontal region as well as generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the frontal region, involving both gray and white matter, which is consistent with the known stroke and hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
