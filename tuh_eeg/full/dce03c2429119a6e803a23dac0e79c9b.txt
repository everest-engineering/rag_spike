LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a past medical history of multiple sclerosis and asthma as well as seizures.  Seizures are characterized as shaking, vomiting, followed by left facial twisting.  These episodes can last up to 12 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Depakote, Dilantin, __________  and others.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  The recording was performed in the laboratory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is mostly asleep throughout the recording.  During brief wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9.5-10 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuated with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation is not induced.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving during high flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal briefly awake and mostly asleep 21-minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
