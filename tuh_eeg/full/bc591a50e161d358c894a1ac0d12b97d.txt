CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old right handed male with confusional spells.  The first episode began 10 years ago and has occurred within the last 6 months.  Also episodes of stumbling.  The patient is still working and finds that the confusional and stumbling are an impediment.
MEDICATIONS:  Nifedical, Simvastatin, Finasteride, Sanctura,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an alpha rhythm which reaches 10 Hz but there is also some 7-8 Hz activity noted in the background.  As the patient becomes drowsy, arrhythmic delta activity can be identified in both hemispheres, a bit more prominently in the right posterior region. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A small degree of background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting and slowing a bit more prominent in the right posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted in this record.  This is considered abnormal for a subject of this are but the features are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes including underlying ischemic cerebral vascular disease.
