HISTORY:
42 y .o. male referred for routine EEG after he was found unresponsive on the street . He has a history of drug abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Fentanyl, Haldol, Versed, Lovenox
SEDATION: As above TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The record consists predominantly of sleep.
During very brief periods of wakefulness, the background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with an excess of delta frequencies. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. A definite posterior dominant rhythm is not captured.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse background slowing are seen.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and diffuse
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
There is mild generalized slowing. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed. Photic Stimulation : Not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake-and-asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Excess of delta frequencies in wakefulness
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
