Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse 18-25Hz beta activity is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Diffuse beta activity
No stage 2 sleep, Normal
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is a NORMAL EEG, awake.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 1
and 2 sleep were not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
