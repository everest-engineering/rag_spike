CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old male with stroke, recent carotid endarterectomy, episode of right-sided weakness and worsening speech. Recent left carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Percocet, Glipizide, ASA, Labetalol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern with a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, excess theta and shifting slowing which is sometimes a bit more prominent in the left posterior quadrant.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Occasional shifting slowing particularly the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this individual with a recent, left parietal occipital infarct. No epileptiform features were noted. The background slowing noted in this record is not quite as prominent as in previous studies. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study capturing one of his
confusional spells may be of use.
