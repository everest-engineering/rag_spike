CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old left handed woman with Sturge Weber Syndrome, prosthetic globe, facial hemangioma, and epilepsy characterized by tonic-clonic seizures, seizure-free for the last 8 years.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, there is an asymmetry in that there is a tenuous alpha rhythm which is significantly lower voltage and sometimes more attenuated on the left compared to the right.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and at that point the alpha rhythm is more symmetric. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, again a little bit more prominent on the right than the left.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
HR:    90 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
A subtle asymmetry in the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  The subtle asymmetry in the alpha rhythm may be correlated with this patient's imaging.
