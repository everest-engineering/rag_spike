LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 75-year-old man with a history of dementia, who now presents with the recurrence of episodes of generalized body shaking, that occur primarily while the patient is falling asleep.  A similar episode occurred on 10/31/2012, after abdominal surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of low to moderate amplitude polymorphic mixture of theta and delta activity with occasional broadly based triphasic waveforms that have an anterior-to-posterior lag and more prominent posteriorly.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Occasional triphasic waveforms.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute awake only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates nonspecific cerebral dysfunction and encephalopathy.  Triphasic waveforms could be seen in the setting of encephalopathy.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
