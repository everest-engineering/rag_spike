LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 20-year-old man who while asleep had the sensation of wave-like sensation going over his body followed by shaking.  These episodes started approximately 2 years ago.  They have become increasingly more frequent.  The last such episode occurred on 05/21/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed in the laboratory.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at low amplitudes anteriorly.  The rhythm is noted over the central leads.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex wave sleep spindles and some K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
