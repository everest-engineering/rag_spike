EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1887
HISTORY:
71 y.o. female with a history of dementia who presented with neglect and went on to have fever and lethargy,	referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:

No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A bedside portable STAT 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and tactile stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The	background is poorly organized, slow with 7 Hz PDR which is disrupted on the right. There are bursts of ADA, which are more prolonged on the right.	During drowsiness	movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not sustained
Generalized slowing is present.	Focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES : Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal :
Generalized background slowing and disorganization Superimposed R focal slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This	EEG supports a bihemispheric process which impacts the right hemisphere including grey and white matter more than the left.
There were no epileptiform features
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
