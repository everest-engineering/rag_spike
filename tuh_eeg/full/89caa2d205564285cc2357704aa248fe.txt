Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
lethargic
Description:
With maximal stimulation, an 8Hz alpha rhythm is present but is poorly formed and fragmented.
Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess
diffuse admixed  5-7Hz activity is present during wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  .
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR - unable to determine. Patient is on
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
