CAD, HTN, ALD, THORACIC ANEURYSM
Medications:	HEPARIN, FENTANYL, ISOFLURANE, ACCOMADEN, VECURONIUM, ZINACEF,
NOREPINEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As the procedure was done the background activity became
predominantly irregular low voltage , 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies with intermittent attenuation noted.  Around 9:45AM some alternating
asymmetry was noted and reported to the team.  At 11:16AM the EEG became completely
attenuated. The EEG became more continuous but background remained in the delta range at the
No focal slowing is present.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a 7 hour EEG during an uneventful cardiac surgery.
