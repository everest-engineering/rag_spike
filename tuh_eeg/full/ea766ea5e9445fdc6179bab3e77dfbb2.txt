CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old male who became short of breath after walking up the stairs
and became Incontinent followed by CPR on 05126 2010 at4:00 p.m. now with twitching of the
mouth.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lipitor, Insulin, Pantoprazole, Avelox, ASA, Plavix, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient Is Intubated and looking away from the
camera.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a dynamic pattern with
lower voltage, slower rhythmic delta frequency activity of 0.5 to 2 Hertz. This activity is
interrupted by brief 1-2 second bursts of higher amplitude, 4 Hertz activity. This activity Is
prominent In the frontal regions, a little bit more remarkable on the left and there is a little bit
more rhythmic 5.4 Hertz activity more so on the left than the right. Stimulation of the patient
does not particularly activate the record. Review of the record at slower paper spreads
demonstrates a pattern that is approximately 3 seconds long with a burst of delta and then
some of the more slower rhythmic activity. It Is not absolutely stereotypic but the bursts
certainly do have a pattern of slower delta, perhaps a little bit more so on the left than the right
and then the rhythmic 4 Hertz activity.
J:!B;. 110 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern of rhythmic.
2. Low delta with periodic, rhythmic activity.
CLINICAL This EEG is not definitively an epileptiform pattern. It may
represent a post anoxic pattern but could represent an epileptiform equivalent. There is no
frequency evolution. Ongoing evaluation is advised.
