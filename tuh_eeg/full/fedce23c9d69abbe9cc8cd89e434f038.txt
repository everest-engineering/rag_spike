CLINICAL HISTORY: 15 year old right handed female, 5-months pregnant, with myoclonic jerks for years, but worsening with the use of Ability, staring spells, behavioral issues, and tremor, previously treated.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, slowing to 8.5 Hz when the patient is drowsy.  Vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS are noted in stage II sleep.  During photic stimulation there are a handful of subtle sharp waves in the right central parietal region.  In addition, there are a handful of vertex waves which phase reverse primarily to the right of the midline and there are 1-2 that phase reverse to the left of the midline. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for a teenage of this age due to:
Subtle right central sharp waves noted around the time of photic stimulation, not consistently associated with photic stimulation and independent of the patient's photic driving response.
Asymmetric vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with this patient's neurodevelopmental history.  If this is individual is thought to have seizures or myoclonic jerks, this may be a reasonable localization for this syndrome.
