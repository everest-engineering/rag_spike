CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old male, who began to have seizures in March of 2015, recurring in April and July 20th. Seizures characterized by loss of consciousness, foaming at the mouth, shaking, and an aura.  He has a history of Xanax and marijuana ingestion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 12.5 hertz, 40-60 microvolt alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with rhythmic central theta.  POSTS are noted in stage 1 sleep.  Stage 2 sleep was not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving as the patient drifts off to sleep.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study with additional sleep may be of value.
