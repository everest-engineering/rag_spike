LENGTH OF RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of seizures.  She has not had any seizures since being started on Keppra.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at the lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and diffuse beta becomes more prominent.  Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the bilateral temporal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and reproduces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving and multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild bilateral temporal slowing.
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG due to intermittent mild bitemporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  Deluxe epileptiform discharges noted in the EEG do not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
