CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old man with a history of bipolar affective disorder and depression presents with complaints of waking up with left leg numbness and complaints that it feels that he is getting weaker.
MEDICATIONS:  None
REASON FOR STUDY:  Left leg numbness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen rarely at T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare left midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
