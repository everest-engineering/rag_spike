TYPE OF STUDY:  Long-term monitor.  This is the last day of the EEG recording.  I already did the other 2 days.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy, seizures usually occur when she is upset.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Seroquel, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient reports a seizure characterized by leg twitching at 2 a.m.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-organized pattern.
This EEG demonstrates significant different artifacts including 2 artifacts, face rubbing, nose rubbing artifacts.
There are no pushbuttons that correlate with a seizure, but there is an episode at 2:38 a.m. when the patient is taking off her CPAP mask which is approximately around the time that she reported the seizure.  It is difficult to see any specific behaviors that look like a seizure, but there is some rhythmic artifact at that point.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Two behavioral events, neither with EEG correlates.
The absence of interictal epileptiform activity.
Disturbance of sleep-wake cycle.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG, not surprisingly, demonstrates a disrupted sleep-wake cycle in this morbidly obese patient who spent the hospitalization in bed.  She did appear to sleep better with CPAP.  The behaviors in question had unusual
semiology for an epileptiform seizure and did not have EEG correlate suggesting that they may not be epileptiform in nature.
