History:	61 year old woman with a history of dementia
Medications:	Abilify, Restoril, Percocet, Seroquel, Xanax, Colace, Oscal, Flexeril, Zantac
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  During drowsiness, bursts of diffuse delta activity appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  Occasional premature QRS complexes are captured on
a single EKG lead.  EKG artifact is noted.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 1 hour EEG because of diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
