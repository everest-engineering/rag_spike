CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old male with left thalamic hemorrhagic stroke with interventricular extension status post bilateral EVD. Intubated on the ventilator.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vancomycin, Zosyn, Gentamicin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has bilateral horizontal eye movements. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing beings, the patient is drowsy. Activity demonstrates generalized slowing with low voltage delta 1 to 2 Hz with 4 Hz theta. With stimulation, low voltage becomes beta frequency. Also noted is slower right posterior region activity consistent with delta frequency. In the left frontal region noted is a breech rhythm consistent with EVD placement
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage delta 1 Hz to 2 Hz with 4 Hz beta.
2. Reactive becomes low voltage beta left frontal breech rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as expected with left thalamic bleed with interventricular hemorrhage. Breech rhythm is compatible with bilateral EVD placement.
