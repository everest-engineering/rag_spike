DATE OF STUDY:  01/16/2013 to 01/17/2013, for a total of 24 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 52-year-old woman with recurrent seizures since 2007, despite multiple medications, here for differential and classification.
MEDICATIONS:  Off all medications in the last 24 hours.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 very frequently and rarely at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Events:  The patient's family reported an event around 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.  No abnormal behavior could be seen during the EEG and there is no abnormal EEG signal seen throughout that hour.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing (left more than right).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region (left more than right), which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  No video correlate was seen with the reported event by the family and no abnormality was seen on the EEG.  This makes the clinical significance of the event uncertain.
