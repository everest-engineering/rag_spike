HISTORY
A 56-year-old male with tonic-clonic seizures and loss of consciousness on June 11, 2011, history of head injury and
hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra and metformin.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. This is an
awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with
Vertex waves and stage 1 sleep. Pulses are also noted.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
IMPRESSION:
This EEG is within limits of normal with an alpha rhythm of 8.5 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
In contrast to the previous EEG of April 19, 2011, the background EEG was somewhat slow. There are sections of the
records where the patient does achieve a normal alpha rhythm and therefore this EEG would be considered within normal
limits, neither EEG demonstrated epileptiform activity.
