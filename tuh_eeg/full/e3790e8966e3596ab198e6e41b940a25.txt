History:	62 YO MALE P/W ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER RIGHT QUAD. FOR 3 DAYS. PT HAS
TRACE ( TRANSARTERIAL CHEMOEMBOLIZATION) PMHX: HCV, DM, HTN, CVA,
ESOPHAGEAL CA S/P CHEMO XRT , LIVER METS AND HCC
Medications:	Ativan, morphine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  There is diffuse excess 6-7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness,
the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Almost continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontocentral region, maximum at
F3, during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is breach artifact over the left
frontocentral region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 100-110.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left frontal, frontocentral
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Breach artifact, left
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm. These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically nonspecific.  2) almost continuous focal slowing in the left frontocentral region with
breach artifact.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. Breach artifact is
consistent with a history of craniotomy.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Please note the patient is tachycardic.
