AGE: 61 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/30/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1879
HISTORY:
61 y.o. male with a history of diabetes referred for routine EEG for possible seizure September 21, 2015.
He had an episode with loss of consciousness shaking Â·but no incontinence of foaming from the mouth . Prior to the episode he felt that his vision was off and he felt afraid.
MEDICATIONS:
Metformin
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity , organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.
During brief drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse increase in beta was noted
Deeper stages of sleep Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Produces hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing, a normal finding
Photic Stimulation: Does not significantly activate the record
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
