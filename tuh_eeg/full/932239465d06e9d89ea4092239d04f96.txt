CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old left handed female with a history of seizures described as ringing in the ears and feeling dizzy, followed by tonic-clonic seizures, the last one in November.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is only recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   None.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Further recording capturing deeper stages of sleep may aid in confirming the diagnosis.
