CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old woman with epilepsy for the last 15 years.  Date of last seizure unknown.  Seizure is characterized as body shaking with incontinence and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, Lamictal, Carbatrol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall background is relatively low voltage and in maximum wakefulness there is a small amount of excess theta and beta.  The record is slightly disorganized.  There is some artifacts noted in the record, but no definitive epileptiform discharges.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  Slow rolling eye movements were also noted in drowsiness.
Hyperventilation produces a slight increase in amplitude and theta.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Review of this record in an average reference suggests that there may be a little bit more irregular slowing at the midline.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a nonspecific, but abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing and disorganization.
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with seizures semiology, imaging, and clinical history.  Additional EEG recording may be of value to capture epileptiform activity.
