History:	28 year old woman with a reported generalized convulsion several days ago, now
presents with body myoclonic and focal weakness.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with variable cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake -only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
