CLINICAL HISTORY:   44 year old female with history of seizures described as recurrent episodes of generalized shaking and hour of feeling shaky.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Lisinopril, Naprosyn, Flexeril, Tramadol, Cymbalta.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed and hyperventilation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV, which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  Activating procedures were photic stimulation and hyperventilation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Focal slow waves at F7/F3 seen intermittently
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent left anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of intermittent left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
