CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old woman with left subdural hematoma, status post surgery on June 14th for cranial repair, recurrent seizures.  Prior anticoagulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Versed, phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in the neurological ICU.  The patient was comatose, intubated, and very minimally responsive with some withdrawal of the left arm during the record.  Patient was taken off recording briefly to go to the interventional radiology suite.  At the end of this 24-hour section, Versed was reduced and then eliminated
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern.  There are rare sections with intermittent attenuation which is relatively generalized.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a consistent pattern with lower voltage mixed 7-8 Hz activity and smaller amounts of beta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a breach rhythm, maximum at T5 with sharply contoured slowing, sharp waves, and fast activity in that region.  The sharp waves are noted in the record including 5:53 a.m.  A bit more prominent sharp waves were noted again at 7 p.m.
In the final hours of the record, on the morning of the 17th, the midazolam was decreased.  This did not substantially changed the EEG in any way.  By the afternoon of the 17th Midazolam had stopped and no additional seizures appeared.
HEART RATE 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-36 hour section of continuous EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
No seizures.
Focal slowing and sharp waves in the region of the patient's craniotomy.
Clinical correlation: This is an abnormal study with generalized and focal slowing as well as focal sharp waves but seizures have resolved.
