CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old male with cholecystitis status post lap chole, then found unresponsive status post code on September 5th.  Now with prolonged coma, but triggers the ventilator.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, insulin, others. No sedatives
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.  The patient demonstrates mild, head rocking artifacts with the ventilator.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow, low voltage and featureless.  It is recorded with a sensitivity of 3 uv/mm  There is some asymmetric eye movement artifact noted in the record.
Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  Auditory stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
Heart rate 116 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, featureless pattern.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual, who is now approximately 1 week status post an anoxic insult, in the absence of sedative hypnotic medications, this EEG carries an extremely worrisome prognosis.
