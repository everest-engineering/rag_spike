CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old left-handed woman with epilepsy since 1989, seizure-free for the last 3 years.  Seizures characterized by movements of the head to the right and left arm shaking.  Chronic right hemiparesis since birth.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This EEG includes wakefulness through sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta followed by beta.
In wakefulness, lambda waves were noted.  In addition, occasionally in wakefulness, there is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more theta noted in the right hemisphere than the left and disruption of the faster frequency activity on the right.  Of note, lambda waves are a bit higher amplitude on the right.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to:  Subtle focal slowing in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right and needs to be correlated with imaging.  No previous EEGs were seen.
