History:	23 YR OLD FEMALE WITH SZ ONSET 4 YRS AGO.  CANNOT DETERMINE LOC,
SZ PRECEDED BY SLEEPINESS AND EYE BLINKING OR STARING OCCURRING
AT
Medications:	DEPAKOTE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Patient
had an episode during EEG where she became unresponsive at 1:49 and ended 1:53. During the
episode she was not answering questions asked by EEG technologist. Patient did not have
movements and eyes were closed for the entire event.  On EEG, patient had posterior dominant
rhythm of 9 Hz and no epileptiform activity. No EEG correlation during event.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Of note the patient had a clinical episode of unresponsiveness during the
EEG which was without change in the background cerebral activity.  This observation is consistent
with a non-epileptic event such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizure.
