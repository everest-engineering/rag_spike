History:	79 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WIT ONSET X 2-3 YRS AGO OF SHORT TERM
MEMORY LOSS AND 4 EPISODES OF LOC LASTING A FEW SEC W/ BLADDER
THEN BACK TO BASELINE INCONT PER DAUGHTER.
Medications:	alprazolam, ASPIRIN,  NAMENDA XR DC'D X 1 WEEK AGO
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
The bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing is normal for age.
