CLINICAL HISTORY:  An elderly woman with dementia, weakness, and lethargy.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Aricept, Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record for a confused adult.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a lower voltage record and scant 6 to 7 Hz alpha frequency activity.  In wakefulness, the overall EEG is relatively featureless.  Drowsiness is characterized by a pattern with beta and theta, and the patient fluctuates between wakefulness and drowsiness with occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate irregular, 78 beats per minute, with artifact in the EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal bedside EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The background slowing and disorganization are nonspecific findings but can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as an underlying dementing illness.
