CLINICAL HISTORY: A 57-year-old woman with adult onset, refractory nocturnal tonic clonic seizures.
Most recent seizure 2 weeks ago. Seizures complicated by memory impairment and depression.
MEDICATIONS: Zonisamide, Keppra and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: A digital video EEG was performed In the EEG monitoring unit
using standard, 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. During the overnight
recording, no clinical or electrographic seizures were identified. Continuous seizure and spike detection
software was utilized. This section of the record captures wakefulness and sleep .
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm . The
overall background includes excess theta and an overall pattern that is somewhat disorganized . In
wakefulness and in sleep, there Is a right anterior temporal sharp wave or spike focus. This Is right
anterior temporal, but in average reference and other references, although there is some frontal
Involvement that is consistently maximum with highest amplitude at T2. The epileptiform discharge can
be seen In wakefulness through sleep .
Over the course of the recording, by the early morning hours, there Is a little less in the way of
background slowing and disorganization.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This first 24 hours of video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. A right anterior temporal sharp wave noted in wakefulness and sleep which Is at times subtle and at other times more well defined, but It Is consistently maximum In the right anterior temporal rather than the frontal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION : This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy. There Is a bit more slowing in the frontal regions bilaterally, right greater than left, but the epileptiform activity is consistently
more frontal in nature.
