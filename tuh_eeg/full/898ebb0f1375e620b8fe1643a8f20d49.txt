PROCEDURE:  This was an outpatient EEG.
HISTORY:  This 58-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, status post temporal lobectomy, one seizure 2 months ago.  The patient has had a left temporal lobectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Aricept, Vimpat, Keppra, Topamax, nabumetone, and oxybutynin.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  This is a very drowsy patient.  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is accentuation of beta activity on the left with a little bit of lower voltage, left mid temporal maximum underlying theta delta.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the same finding.
The deeper stages of sleep include an increase in beta, posts and a suggestion of spindles, but then the patient alerts.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Breach rhythm, an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
Rhythmic slowing in the left temporal region seen primarily in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No previous EEGs were available at this time for comparison.  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left with a history of previous temporal lobectomy.
