EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG

electrodes, comatose

Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring

Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 14 hours from 03/13/2014 to 03/14/2013.   Nursing-

initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed

at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All

automatically detected by the attending neurologist.

# Push button events	0

Description of pushbutton events

None

Description:

No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by marked

diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior

gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.

Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the mid and

posterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. At times the delta

appear to become more monomorphic but without clear evolution.  There is an asymmetry of beta

activity, with more activity on the right consistent with a breach.  No epileptiform discharges are

present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84

Summary of Findings:

Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, posterior

Diffuse slowing, polymorphic

Interpretation:

This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right posterior temporal

and midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In

addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are

etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings

demonstrate improvement from her previous EEG.  These findings were conveyed to the primary

team
