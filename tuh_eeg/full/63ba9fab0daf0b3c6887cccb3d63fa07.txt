History:	70 year old woman with experienced a MVA with no recollection of the event.
Medications:	Synthroid/ HTN Med
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient transitions rapidly between wakefulness and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Other, very rapid transitions between wakefulness and drowsiness/sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 25-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  This EEG suggests a
hypersomnolent patient since she transitions very rapidly between wakefulness and
drowsiness/sleep.  Please correlate clinically.
