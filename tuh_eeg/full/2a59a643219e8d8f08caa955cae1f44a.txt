History:	64 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SUDDEN ONSET OF RIGHT WEAKNESS
NOTED WITH LEFT HAND TREMOR EEG TO R/O SZ.  RECENT DISCHARGE.
PMHX SIG FOR NEW RT CEREBELLAR INFARCT, OLD LT INFARCT
FOLLOW UP EEG 10/6 IP
FOLLOW UP EEG FOR ONSET OF BILAT. NEXT. SHAKING.
Medications:	BP MEDS, INSULIN, HEPARIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During limited maximal wakefulness, the background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha
rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the in the right centrotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional polymorphic delta activity is also present in
the left mid-temporal and parietal regions.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 72.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal, Centrotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, mid, Sometimes more parietal
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
right centrotemporal and occasionally in the left mid-temporal and parietal regions.  These findings
are indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in those regions,  which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
