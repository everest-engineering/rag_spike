CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 20-year-old woman with 2 black out spells 05/19 and 05/22 characterized by chest pain, shortness of breath, and then loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
TECHNICAL:  Impedances were acceptable.  Eye movements are slightly asymmetric, raising concerns about electrode placement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Central mu rhythm of 9.5 Hz was identified but testing was not performed to confirm this.
In addition to asymmetric eye movements there is a slight asymmetry between the right and left frontal regions.  The right frontal region has a little bit more fast activity then the left.
As the patient becomes drowsy there is a little bit more theta in the right central region relative to the left.
Features of drowsiness including increase in beta, rhythmic central theta and occasional, slight asymmetries in terms of faster frequency activity in the central regions.  As the patient awakens from sleep, mu activity is seen which may be identifiable in the right or left central regions.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy but did activate the record.
Heart rate 114 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a questionably abnormal EEG due to asymmetry in the frontal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the asymmetry described with the eye movements, the findings described above may be an artifact.  Therefore a follow-up EEG may be of value.
No epileptiform discharges
