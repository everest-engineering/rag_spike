History:	34 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS FOR PULMONARY THROMBO ENDARTERECTOMY


Medications:	Induction Meds, Versed, Fentanyl
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
The background commenced with a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  The cooling commenced at 09:59AM.  There was rapid diffuse attenuation of the
background with some epileptiform activity seen. Around 10:19AM there was complete attenuation
of the background and at 11:51 some short diffuse theta bursts were noted.  The patient remained
cooled until 12:30PM. The background started to become symmetrically more continuous.
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was noted until around 10AM and
returned around 12:45PM. It was regular at 66 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
