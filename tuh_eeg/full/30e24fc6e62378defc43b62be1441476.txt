REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 39-year-old woman with episodes of bilateral arm stiffening, head may move to the right for 20 minutes.  Has had 4 to 5 seizures in the past month.  Moves her arms and feet.  No legs.  Screaming.  History of MR and lateral gaze.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  During the entire recording, there is continuous muscle artifact seen throughout making it difficult to interpret the EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Keppra, famotidine, topiramate, Lasix, valproic acid, and lorazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while shaking and awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a mixed theta alpha frequency discharge seen diffusely but appears to be maximal in the frontal regions that appears to be very rhythmic and sharply contoured.  Some of them are clear sharp waves which appear to be rhythmic and occipitally predominant and correlate with the patient's movements which will be described below.  This discharge continues throughout the recording and it does not appear to stop but rather just worsens and improves slightly throughout the recording.  In the video the patient appears to be twitching her arms and eyes side to side slowly but rhythmically and irregularly.  This clinical correlate is consistent with a seizure.  There is no other background that could be seen throughout the recording.
HEART RATE:  114, however, due to the muscle artifact in the EKG this may be not precise.
IMPRESSION:  A normal EEG due to generalized seizure with clinical correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals a continuous electrographic and clinical generalized seizure throughout the entirety of the record.  This was informed to the primary team and long-term monitoring will be performed.
