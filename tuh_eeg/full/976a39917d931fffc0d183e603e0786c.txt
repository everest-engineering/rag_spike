CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old woman with migraine headache and tonic-clonic seizures.  Spinal stenosis and anxiety.  Breakthrough seizures when the patient ran out of her medicine.  Last seizure, August 7th requiring emergency room care. Two-year history of epilepsy with family history of epilepsy. Past history of tremor and weakness.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, gabapentin, Estradiol, Ambien, lisinopril, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited symmetric bilateral driving.  Stage 2 sleep included abundant K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  In stage 2 sleep, there is a single left mid temporal sharp wave with a clear after going slow wave.  It occurs in a morphology that almost resembles rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness, but the patient is clearly in stage 2 sleep with abundant spindle activity and POSTS.  In addition, there was a very subtle discharged 2 seconds prior to it.  The left temporal discharge clearly has a field in the left frontal central and central temporal region.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Although only a single, well defined sharp wave was identified in this EEG, there is a clear after going slow wave.  This is the third EEG for this patient and it is the 1st EEG to demonstrate any epileptiform activity.  This is also the 1st EEG, which captured stage 2 sleep.

If additional information is needed, a repeat study again with more substantial stage 2 sleep is suggested.
