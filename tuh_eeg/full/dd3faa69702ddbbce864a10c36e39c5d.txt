History:	20 yr old male r handed h/o seizure. pt found down in bathroom seizing for 5 min in
bathroom after hearing a thumb parents went to bathroom and found son on floor
next to him a needle.60 cm head
Medications:	Lamictal, Zonegran, Versed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity is characterized by burst-to-
suppession pattern with burst-to-suppression ratio of ~1:4.  Bursts consist of a mixture of moderate
amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity with underriding alpha activity.  There is asymmetry
of bursts with left sided bursts being slightly longer and occasionally occurring on the left only.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR of 84 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, ~1:4 ratio
Other, bursts of activity are mildly longer on the left and occur without right sided bursts
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal 45 minute EEG due to ~1:4 burst-suppression pattern, slight burst
asymmetry with bursts more pronounced over the left hemisphere and lack of reactivity. These
findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but
at least partially medication induced.  Asymmetry in bursts indicate focal cerebral dysfunction over
the right hemisphere, possibly structural in etiology.  Patient was placed on long-term EEG
