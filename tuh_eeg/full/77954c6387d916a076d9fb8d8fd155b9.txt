CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 31-year-old with epilepsy.  The patient is unable to describe her epilepsy, not taking her Keppra.  Currently, she is pregnant.  Date of delivery is October 20, 2013.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient's previous EEG was not available for comparison.  Impedances were acceptable although, T1 and T2 electrodes were slightly above 5 kg.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 alpha rhythm.  posterior slow waves of youth were identified.  In wakefulness, there is shifting slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity in the right or left posterior temporal region.  In addition, there is an 8 second burst of focal slowing in the left temporal region.  There is a burst of sharply contoured delta at F7.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous background slowing.  The patient transitions in a narrow stage I sleep with brief vertex waves and arousals.  Hypoventilation produced an increase in theta.  Photo stimulation elicited harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.  Heart rate is 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
1. Burst of shifting posterior temporal slowing.
2. A burst of left temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The shifting slowing and the left temporal focal slowing are all in the temporal region.  They are no definitive sharp waves or spikes and just one burst of sharply contoured slowing.  These findings may become impaired with her previous EEG, but a focal mechanism for epilepsy might be considered.
