CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 24-year-old male with ingestion of alcohol and other recreational drugs, admitted this morning with obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Cogentin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was initially very drowsy and then with tactile stimulation, was awake and grimacing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The awake record is somewhat obscured by muscle artifact.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles.
Of note, the initial section of the record, after use of Ativan is more of a beta pattern.
Heart rate: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG primarily in sleep, but with brief wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be performed in followup when the patient is able to cooperate in the lab.
