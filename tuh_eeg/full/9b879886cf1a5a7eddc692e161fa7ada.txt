History:	38 YO MALE WITH SYMPTOMS OF MUSCLE CRAMPS, METAL TASTE IN
MOUTH, LOSS OF CONTINENCE OVER A PERIOD OF 3 DAYS. WENT TO OSH ED.
THEY SAID HE MAY HAVE HAD A SZ.
Medications:	NO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. It also produces an occipital predominant
theta at frequencies of 7 and above.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The theta seen with photic stimulation is of unclear significance but not
