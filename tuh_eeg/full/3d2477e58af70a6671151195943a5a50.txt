History:	51 year old man with a history of seizures since the age of 9 yo, now presents with
prolonged convulsion.
Medications:	Keppra, zonisamide and Ativan (given in ED)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal the background consists of 9-10 Hz PDR and expected AP gradient.  For
majority of the recording, however, there is excess diffuse polymorphic theta activity and poor AP
gradient.  Poor formed vertex waves and K-complexes are captured.
Occasional low amplitude generalized frontally-maximal spike-and-wave discharges are seen.
Additionally, independent low amplitude left frontotemporal and right frontotemporal spikes with
aftergoing slow waves are captured.  Maximal scalp negativity  occurs over F7/T1- F3/C3 and
F8/T2- F4/C4 leads, respectively.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, rare, left frontotemporal
Spikes, rare, right frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Spike-and-wave complexes, occasional generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 21-minute EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing
and disorganization and (2) occasional generalized and rare independent left and right
frontotemporal epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing and disorganization are indicative of mild
to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Epileptiform
discharges are suggestive of generalized pattern of epilepsy that is treated.  Please correlate
