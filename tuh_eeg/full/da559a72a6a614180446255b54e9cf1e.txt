CLINICAL HISTORY:   29 year old male with mental retardation and cerebral palsy, admitted with Dilantin toxicity and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lovenox, Protonix, Heparin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is poorly organized.  There is a mixture of frontal beta and background theta.  There is little in the way of a well defined alpha rhythm.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Background slowing.
Paucity of normal awake wave forms.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The profound Dilantin toxicity may play a role in the background slowing.  It may be appropriate to repeat an EEG when his level is back in range.
