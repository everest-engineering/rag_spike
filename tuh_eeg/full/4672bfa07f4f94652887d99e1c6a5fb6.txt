CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right handed woman with history of fetal alcohol syndrome, developmental delay. Past recurrent evaluations for behavioral disorder. Question of underlying epilepsy. The patient had a staring spell March 11, lasting minutes with tongue biting and drowsiness.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed using standard 1 -2 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation performed. The patient is reasonably cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG is slow and poorly organized. It is primarily a beta frequency background with prominent lambda. During the EEG. on 1 or 2 occasions, the patient stares off to the left, but the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with lambda compatible with the patient looking at something. When the tech is able to get the patient to cover her eyes, there seems to be a fast alpha variant with 7.3 hertz activity and 15 hertz activity. In this challenging EEG, there is a single burst of sharply contoured slowing in the left temporal region and lateral rectus eye artifact.
HR: 90 BPM
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Excess theta.
3. Poor organization.
CLINICAL Only a single burst of sharply contoured slowing was seen out of
the left which, therefore, is not considered epileptiform and may be artifact. The slow alpha and
the alpha subharmonic were not seen in her previous EEGs which on occasion did demonstrate
a 9 hertz alpha rhythm.
