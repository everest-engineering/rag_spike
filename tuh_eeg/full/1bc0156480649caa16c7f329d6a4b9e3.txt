CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 20-year-old right-handed gentleman with epilepsy, onset at age 5, last seizure in 2009 at age 16.  Mother describes spells with abrupt loss of consciousness, no aura, eyes rolling up and then shaking.  The patient is described as having no postictal impairment.  Concomitant depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Prozac.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory EEG with impedance under 5 kilohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  Drowsiness, but not deeper stages of sleep were achieved.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry in the alpha rhythm with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the right and a slightly slower alpha rhythm on the left.  In addition, the alpha is slightly disrupted.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, there is a subtle asymmetry with slight reduction in alpha and theta frequency activity on the left relevant to the right.  Brief stage 1 sleep was noted with higher amplitude, more rhythmic theta, and rare vertex waves with slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the left temporal underlying slowing.  In addition, there is some hypersynchronous rhythmic bilateral slowing noted in hyperventilation, although the tech noted that the patient made little effort with hyperventilation.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to.
Focal features in the left hemisphere including disruption of the alpha rhythm.
Left temporal focal slowing, most notable in hyperventilation and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  There are no previous EEGs for comparison.  This EEG may be correlated with imaging in search of an underlying structural or functional abnormality on the left.
