History:	56 YR MALE FOUND UNRESP THRASHING WITH PILL BOTTLES.  ++BENZOS,
OXYCODONE.  PMHX: DRUG ABUSE, GSW- LEFT LEG PARALYSIS, GIVEN
NARCAN  NO RESP. VDRF,
Medications:	ED, SUX, ETOMIDATE, ATIVAN, VECURONIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by a burst
suppression pattern on a 1:1 ratio with bursts composed of disorganized diffuse low voltage delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Sometimes there are some sharply contoured discharges in the occipital region during these
bursts.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional high amplitude focal sharp waves are present with phase
reversal maximum at T3 .  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left temporal, mid
Burst-suppression pattern, continuous, Some occipital sharply contoured discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the left midtemporal
region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition
diffuse background slowing, burst suppression and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
