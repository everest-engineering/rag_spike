CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old male, status post gunshot wound to the chest many years ago, chronic care facility individual, admitted with sepsis.  Reported past history of anoxic brain injury and PEA code in 2014.
MEDICATIONS:  Cefepime, scopolamine, and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  This is a 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient has a tracheostomy and is not responsive to the technologist.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an essentially low voltage, featureless pattern, lacking in any of the normal developmental milestones for an awake adult.  Prominent EKG artifact is noted.  Muscle artifact is noted.  Eye movement artifacts and oral chewing were noted in the EEG and the video.
Rare, paroxysmal bursts was underlying, generalized discrete sharp waves were noted in the background.
There is no reactivity or variability.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, essentially featureless.
Lack of reactivity or variability, although this is only a 20-minute record.
Despite the EKG artifact, there are rare, discrete spikes with an after-going slow wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter.  The patient's oral automatisms and twitching are not seizures.
