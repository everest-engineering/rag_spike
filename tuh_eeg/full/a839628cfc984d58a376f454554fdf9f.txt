ROOM NUMBER:  539.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 66-year-old woman with dementia, chronic back pain, recurrent syncope, evaluate for seizure versus syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Singulair, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible.  The patient was very uncomfortable during the EEG.  She has continuous chewing movements.  The patient was not able to fall asleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is technically challenging given the muscle artifact, but demonstrates a relatively symmetric, diffusely slow pattern with medium amplitude theta and some underlying delta.  A well-defined posterior dominant rhythm was not identified.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness due to background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's previous EEGs were not available at this time.  No epileptiform features were seen.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study in an attempt to capture sleep may be a value.  These findings should be interpreted in the context of this patient's previous imaging, again not available at this time.
