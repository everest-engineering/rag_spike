CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed woman, multigravida, 8-weeks gestation, presented with shortness of breath, dizziness, and seizure like activity with decreased p.o. intake.  Previous similar spells in pregnancy.
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by background slowing with slow rolling eye movements, followed by vertex waves and K-complexes. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep, although it does, however, produce a small amount of driving response.
HR:    100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no focal nor epileptiform features identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study is suggested.
