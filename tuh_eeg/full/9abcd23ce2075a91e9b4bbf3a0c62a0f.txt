REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old woman with generalized tonic-clonic seizure and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Lamictal, and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded mainly in sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record was mainly recorded in sleep with wakefulness that reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some excessive beta seen throughout the recording.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen independently at F7/T3 occasionally and rarely at F8/T4 mainly in sleep.
Focal slowing seen independently at F7/T3 and F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  126.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent anterior temporal sharp waves and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either anterior temporal lobe.  In addition, there is evidence of focal dysfunction and irritability in the same region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
