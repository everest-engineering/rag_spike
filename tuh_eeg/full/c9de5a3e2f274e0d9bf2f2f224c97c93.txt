History:	25 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ ONSET AT AGE 24, SZ AR WITH
LOC, TONGUE BITING, SHAKING AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION, LAST SZ X 1
WEEK AGO
Medications:	Keppra 500 MG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
symmetric vertex waves.  Occasional brief bursts of diffuse, frontally-maximal polymorphic 1 to 2 Hz,
80-100 uV slow waves are observed during drowsiness.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
