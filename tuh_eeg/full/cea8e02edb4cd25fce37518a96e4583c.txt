Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Subtle focal slowing on the right hemisphere-central in stage II  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is mildly ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Very subtle focal slowing on the right
hemisphere due an old cerebral infarct.
