History:	51 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF EPILEPSY. NEW BREAKTHROUGH EVENTS W/ LOC
12/23/2013.
PT HUSBAND HAS VIDEO OF EVENT.
Medications:	Keppra, Altace, Claritin, Po
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
There is intermittent focal theta slowing is present over the right fronto-temporal region.  There are
intermittent right fronto-temporal spikes seen maximal at F8-T4.  At 11:45:55, there is a 12 second
epoch characterized by a buildup of rhythmic theta activity over the right fronto-temporal region.
This is preceded by an arousal from sleep. There is no other clinical correlate to this event.  This
may have represented an electrographic seizure.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to focal slowing and spikes in the right
fronto-temporal region. Focal slowing and spikes suggest a structural brain lesion with epileptiform
potential in the right fronto-temporal region. .  The single 12 second event characterized by
rhythmic theta may reflect a focal right frontotemporal electrographic seizure.
