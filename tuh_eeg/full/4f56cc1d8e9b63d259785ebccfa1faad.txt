History:	61 YO  R. HANDEDNESS MALE DX. WITH LIMBIC ENCEPHALOPATHY,
SEIZURES, MEMORY ISSUES.   LAST SEIZURE APPROX. 3 YEARS AGO
Medications:	SEROQUEL, LAMICTAL, XANAX, DELTASONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces a modest symmetric photic driving response.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL Extended 40-60 minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A normal EEG does
not rule out the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
