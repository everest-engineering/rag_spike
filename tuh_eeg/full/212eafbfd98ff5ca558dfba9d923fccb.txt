History:	74 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O C/C OF DIZZINESS ANS RLE
WEAKNESS, CT HEAD SHOWED LT PARIETAL BRAIN MASS WITH RT MIDLINE
Medications:	PROPOFOL, LABETALOL, TOBRAMYCIN, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There are intermittent periods of diffuse attenuation last for ~1-4 seconds.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some  reactivity to painful
stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Attenuation, intermittent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing, intermittent attenuation and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which may be due at least in part to medication effect.
