History:	51 year old man who was found down with profound hypoglycemia (FSG of 20) who
remains altered.
Medications:	Ativan PRN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
With maximal stimulation, there is appearance of polymorphic unstable PDR at ~ 8-8.5 Hz with
weak AP gradient.  The majority of the waking background consists of polymorphic moderate
amplitude theta >delta activity without the expected AP gradient.  No clear normal sleep
architecture is present, however, periods of quiescence are captured and characterized by diffuse
decrease in amplitudes and appearance of prominent diffuse beta activity.
There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the right, especially over the right temporal
region.  This slowing becomes most apparent during periods of sleep.  No epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right hemispheric, mostly over the temporal region
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate, improves to mild-moderate slowing with significant
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG because of moderate diffuse slowing and subtle
focal right hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction,
possibly structural in etiology.  When compared to the EEG from 12/20/2013, there has been some
improvement in the severity of diffuse slowing.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
