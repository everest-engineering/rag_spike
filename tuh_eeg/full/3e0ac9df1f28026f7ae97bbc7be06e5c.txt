CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old male admitted with episode of an unresponsiveness, inability to follow commands, who has been evaluated for similar spells, but was never started on seizure medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm which is sometimes disrupted on the right compared to the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.  Intermittently, in relaxed wakefulness there is a prominent asymmetry with drop out of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left and some underlying slowing. Photic stimulation does elicit a bilateral driving response.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A somewhat slow and disorganized pattern.
Superimposed focal slowing characterized by slowing of faster frequency activity on the left, sometimes drop out of faster frequency on the left, as well as occasional focal delta or beta on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the left involving gray matter, as well as white matter.
