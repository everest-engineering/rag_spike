History:	63 YR MALE WITH SZS., COLON CA, DM, HTN, CABG.   WITH CC OF SZS PT
WITH POST ICTAL CONFUSION.
Medications:	OXCARBAZEPINE, ATIVAN, DEPAKOTE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present independently in the bilateral mid-temporal
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present
with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR - 96
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, bilateral temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  occasional epileptiform discharges in the left
frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures,  are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy. In addition, there is  continuous focal slowing seen independently in
the bilateral mid-temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in these
regions. Lastly, there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
