CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old right handed female with a history of epilepsy, dementia, spinal stenosis, and pseudoseizures.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Seroquel, Plavix, Celebrex, Lipitor, Femara, Insulin, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly disorganized with an alpha rhythm of 6.8 Hz. Prominent shifting temporal delta is noted. The activity from the temporal regions is relatively sharp contoured. Bursts of generalized background slowing are noted with a regular delta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 66 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This record seems to be slower than previous studies for her.
