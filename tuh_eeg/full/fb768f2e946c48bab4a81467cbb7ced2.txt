CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51 year old man with history of pinealoma, status post resection and radiation, Parkinson's disease, recent history of encephalopathy with right temporal lobe enhancement  and white matter changes.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Zantac.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic simulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The beginning of the record shows marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.  The right hemisphere  is much slower and is featureless.  The left looks close to normal with a 9.5 Hz, 50 microvolt alpha rhythm.  There are areas of T2 T4 arrhythmic slowing, as well as sharply contoured waves in the same region. Photic stimulation is performed  and produces shifting slowing from the T2 T4 region and shifts to the T4 T6 region. There appears to be a small driving response on the left, but not on the right with photic stimulation.

HR:   66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG, but improved when compared to prior in November 2009:
1. 	intrahemispheric asymmetry.  There is sharply contoured rhythmic slowing waves on the right.
2. 	The left is much improved.
3. 	There are no sharp waves on the left.
4.	No seizure activity during this record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is improved from prior EEG in November 2009.  There is still slowing on the right which may present a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. There are no epileptiform activity.  The left is marked improved.
