DATE OF STUDY:  08/28/2013 to 08/29/2013 for a total of 24 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old man with history of left parietal tumor resection and recurrent seizures and epilepsy recently status post status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, phenobarbital, Vimpat.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed. .
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some CC electrode artifact at the beginning of the record which was later fixed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  Overall there is a theta delta continuous slowing seen throughout the recording.  At times improves and there appears to be some muscle artifact and reactivity noted throughout this 24 hour recording.  No normal sleep architecture or activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz.  An amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.  At times intermixed theta was seen, especially at the end of the recording.  Please note that there is also some bifrontal slowing noted throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  100.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen over this 24 hours.
