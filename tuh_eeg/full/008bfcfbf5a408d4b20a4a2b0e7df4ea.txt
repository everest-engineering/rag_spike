History:	71 YR MALE S/P DLT POD X2.  NEURO EVAL AND EVAL FOR CHIN TWITCH VS
SHIVER EMG ADDED.  PT WITH ECMO/ VENT/ NITROUS OXIDE.   LIMITED
SEDATION.  PER NURSE PRIOR TO SURGERY PT WAS ON MUCH SEDATION.
Medications:	FENTANYL 25,  PRECEDEX .3, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Background is characterized by a poorly-formed 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  There is excess diffuse 6-7 Hz theta during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness,
the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, Slow PDR
Artifact, EMG generalized
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Clinical correlation
is recommended.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
