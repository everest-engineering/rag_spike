History:	62 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF LIGHTHEADED, DIZZINESS. LONG TIME.  PMHX: SM
CVA. HAD SEVERE HEADACHE, PRIMARY SENT FOR CT SHOWED SM BLEED
NO OTHER INFO 3 YRS AGO.  HEAD 53.5
Medications:	DICLOFENAC, MECLIZINE, OMEPRAZOLE, NAPROXEN, PLAQUENIL,
PRAVASTATIN, FLEXERIL, ALLEGRA, TYLENOL 3
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bilateral midtemporal region (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No seizure or epileptiform activity was clearly seen.
