History:	19 yo male p/w SZ in car after coming home from school - sleep deprived and drinking.
Single febrile SZ with otitis age 2, fever 101. NOW FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
None None
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and well-organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 11 Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, background slowing, and attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep transients, including positive occipital sharp transients of sleep (POSTS), spindles, and K-complexes, are symmetric and normal.
There is no focal slowing. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation,and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving,which is a normal phenomenon. A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a normal awake,drowsy, and asleep routine EEG. No epileptiform discharges were present. No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected. A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
