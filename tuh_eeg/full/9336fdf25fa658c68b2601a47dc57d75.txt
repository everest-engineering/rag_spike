CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed woman with spina bifida, cerebral abscess,
previous craniotomy, epilepsy for the past 4 years, tonic clonic seizures with postictal confusion
lasting 4 times per year. Now, since 2009, has developed episodes of twitching of mouth,
fingertips, and eyes lasting seconds. These symptoms wax and wane throughout the day.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes generous
beta. There is a suggestion of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and intermittent, rhythmic theta from the
right or left temporal region. There is evidence of a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity
in the right frontal central region, as well as posterior temporal region. There is also occasional
delta noted in this region. Although it is not clear from the description that the patient
experienced her typical facial twitching during the EEG, twitch artifact was noted. Stage 2 sleep
was characterized by POSTS, vertex waves, and spindles. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous
bilateral driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere, including frontal central and frontal temporal
region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right. Although
there is no specific indication that the patient experienced her facial twitching during the EEG
there was a fair amount of intermittent twitch artifact. No epileptiform features were seen on this
EEG nor on the previous study 2 years ago.
