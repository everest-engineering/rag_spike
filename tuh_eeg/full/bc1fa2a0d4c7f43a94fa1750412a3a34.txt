CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed male with episodes of loss of awareness occurring 2 to 5 times per week in the context of dementia. Past EEGs from 2009 demonstrating left temporal focal slowing but no seizures have ever been recorded.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Carbamazepine, Diovan, Actos
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well-organized but still with more of a theta frequency pattern. It is a relatively low voltage pattern with posterior dominant rhythm, difficult to discern but approximately 7 Hz. There is some subtle arrhythmic delta activity and some sharply contoured slowing with occasional T1 sharp waves noted in the background. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and seems to accentuate the focal slowing and sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. As the patient emerges from drowsiness, a more well-defined 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is noted. Photic
stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic, generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed left temporal focal slowing.
3. Occasional left temporal sharp waves accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEGs. The epileptiform activity may be better defined in this EEG than in other studies.
