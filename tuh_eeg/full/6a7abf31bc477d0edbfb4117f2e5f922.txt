CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed female with nocturnal seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Percocet, Trazodone.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Sleep stage I was recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 hertz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. Sleep stage I in noted. Activated procedures include photic stimulation and hyperventilation. There are no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in T3, occasionally at 2-4 hertz and 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild focal slow waves in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with mild focal cerebral dysfunction in the left temporal region which is nonspecific in regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
