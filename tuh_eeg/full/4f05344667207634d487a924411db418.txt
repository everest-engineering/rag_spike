CLINICAL HISTORY: A 21-year-old Mayan from Guatemala transferred with persistent lethargy after receiving Ativan. Intracerebral hemorrhages Involving left subthalamic, pontine and small subcortical right

MEDICATIONS: Colace. The patient received Ativan some hours earlier.

Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible. The patient was somnolent with intermittent decorticate posturing during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a sedated or sleep-like pattern with central beta, beta spindles and POSTS. There is an asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency in the left frontocentral region.

Stimulation of the patient produces posturing and muscle artifact. The EEG when the patient is stimulated is obscured by muscle, but there is an increase in beta and then the patient drifts back 10 the sleep state.

Heart rate 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with more of a sedated pattern with prominent beta.
2. An underlying asymmetry with disruption of the beta spindles in the left frontocentral region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features are congruent with imaging. No epileptiform features were note d. The patient does arouse with tactile stimulation. These findings were reported to the clinical team.
