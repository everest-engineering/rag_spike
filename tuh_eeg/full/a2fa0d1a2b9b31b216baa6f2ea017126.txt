History:	24 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH DX OF CTEH PRESENTS FOR PULMONARY
THROMBOENDARTERECTOMY WITH CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS
Medications:	INDUCTION MEDS: ISOFLURANE, ETOMIDATE, SUCC, VEC, FENTANYL,
MIDAZOLAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  This background progressively slow to a bursts suppression and later
electro cerebral silence.  The records remained symmetric and there where intermittent temporal
sharp waves seen in the anterior temporal and frontal regions with cooling around 24 degrees.
INCISION at 8:47:51 AM,  BURST SUPPRESSION DUE TO ISO 9:14:14 AM, COOLING STARTED
9:26:00 AM,
Intermittent SHARPS NOTED 9:49:11 AM,  5 MIN of ELECTROCEREBRAL SILENCE 10:35:27
AM,  RE-WARMING 12:20:23 PM  At the end of the record the background is composed of diffuse
delta with intermixed alpha discharges seen bilaterally and symmetrically with a maximal field over
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG during brain cooling procedure during cardiopulmonary surgery.
