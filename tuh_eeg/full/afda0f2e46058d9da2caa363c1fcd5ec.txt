CLINICAL HISTORY:   74 year old male with Esophageal cancer.  Patient with episodes of staring, eye deviation and impaired responsiveness.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Benadryl, Narcan, Heparin, Lorazepam, Cipro, Keppra, Morphine, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is ventilated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG in maximal wakefulness is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is a 9Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is some 6Hz activity mixed in.  The patient drifts into drowsiness with an increase in rhythmic slowing.  Shifting slowing is also observed.  On some occasions, the delta activity may be lower amplitude on the left or slower on the right.  Peak vertex waves
are noted in stage I sleep.  Spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  The patient appears to
be tachypneic and uncomfortable. HR: 	104 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background slowing and disorganization.
2. 	Prominent shifting slowing as well as amplitude asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORR  ELATION:
no epileptiform features.
These findings may be correlated with imaging.  There are
