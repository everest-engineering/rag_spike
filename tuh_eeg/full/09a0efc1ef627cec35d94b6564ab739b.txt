CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed woman with stroke in the right PCA distribution, mitral valve endocarditis, hypertension, asthma, depression and an increase in seizures versus increase in TIA.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Keppra, Lovenox, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient has a great deal of muscle movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Underneath all of the muscle and movement artifact, the background EEG is somewhat slow.  It is a mixture of 5 and 7 Hz theta activity.  The posterior theta on occasion seems to be a little slower or trends toward slower frequency activity in the right posterior quadrant in comparison to the left.  In relaxed wakefulness there is the appearance of a bit more alpha frequency activity.  As the patient becomes a bit drowsy, delta in the posterior regions again a bit slower on the right than on the left.   Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Due to the degree of artifact in the background, a follow-up study when the patient is able to cooperate is suggested. In comparison to prior EEGs, no right seizures, sharp waves, spikes nor PLEDS were seen
