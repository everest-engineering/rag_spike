CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male status post liver transplant with abrupt onset of headache on October 14, 2012.  MRI raises concerns about small vessel disease for meningitis.
MEDICATIONS:  Acyclovir, fluconazole, gabapentin, morphine, prednisone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient appears to be relatively drowsy.  There is spontaneous arousals with eye blink and a glimpse of low voltage 9 Hz alpha rhythm.
In apparent wakefulness, there is intermittent, excess rhythmic theta. Rare vertex waves were observed.
Heart rate:  54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is a glimpse of a normal alpha rhythm noted in the background.  The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may be toxic or metabolic.  It may also be seen in the context of a meningitis.  There are no specific hallmarks of a herpes encephalitis however.
