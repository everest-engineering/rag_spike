CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old right-handed woman with a left-sided skull defect
status post resection of a tumor 1 year ago. The patient developed seizures in January
a year ago, characterized by numbness on the right side lasting 15 minutes.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, ASA,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 8.5 Hz
alpha rhythm present bilaterally. Focal slowing and a breach rhythm are noted in the
left frontocentral region. In that context, there is wicket Mu activity in the left central and
temporal region, but there are rare left central sharp waves observed. Hyperventilation
accentuates the focal slowing in the left central region, maximum C3-F3. It also seems
to very subtly accentuate the sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include slowing of
the background but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits
a driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left central focal slowing.
2. Subtle left central sharp waves.
CLINICAL The context of a breach rhythm may make sharp waves
more troublesome to identify. If there are any concerns regarding the characteristics of
this patient's seizures, a more prolonged recording or a sleep record may be of value.
