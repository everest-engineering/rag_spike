PROCEDURE NOTE
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep were recorded. Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
Intermittent T3 electrode artifact.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
HISTORY:
A 41-year-old male with a history of Parkinson disease who presents with an acute onset of dizziness and a history of
tonic-clonic seizure in the ambulance with left-sided numbness. He states he had a history of seizures as a teenager and
had been on Dilantin, which was stopped after he was seizure free for a period of time.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10Hz at 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude. There is well-formed
normal amount of frontal central beta seen. Sleep is characterized by stage 1. Activation procedures with photic
stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
