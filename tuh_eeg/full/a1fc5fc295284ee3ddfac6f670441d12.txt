CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old female with seizures. Past medical history of
epilepsy, diabetes, hypertension, depression, dementia, encephalopathy and left-sided
weakness, colon cancer.

MEDICATIONS: ASA, Folic Acid, Insulin, Keppra, Thiamine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background demonstrated disorganization with a 9
Hertz alpha rhythm and some generous beta. There was a lot of EKG and eye blink
artifact. Sharps were produces in the left anterior temporal region and right anterior
temporal region. The right anterior temporal had more sharp waves than the last.
There was also some focal slowing in the central temporal area. Photic stimulation
produced driving left better than right

Heart rate: N/A but bradycardic and irregular.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal sharp waves which were not seen on the previous EEG.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Disorganized background.Focal slowing in the central temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diagnosis for localization for
mechanism of epilepsy due to the left anterior temporal and right anterior sharp waves.
