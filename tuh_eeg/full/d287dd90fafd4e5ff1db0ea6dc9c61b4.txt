WOKE UP THIS AM COMPLAINING OF SOB,MOTIONED TO WIFE WAS UNABLE
TO SPEAK WENT TO GET WATER BUT PASSED OUT WAS UNRESPONSIVE.
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN, CLONAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 102  Technical difficulties: Almost continuous muscle artifact
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Disorganization
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing, low voltage and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
