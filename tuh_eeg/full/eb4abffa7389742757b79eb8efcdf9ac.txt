MEDICINES:  Lasix, Lexapro, Abilify, many others.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old right-handed woman with history of hospitalizations for hyperammonemia, encephalopathy.  Now with intermittent staring spells.  Past history of childhood szs, anxiety.  Memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Lexapro, Abilify, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record and a technically acceptable study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  In relaxed wakefulness, there is subtle underlying slowing noted in the left temporal region as well as snore artifact.  Later sections of the record are remarkable for significant muscle artifact in the EEG.  There is some paroxysmal bursts of slowing and then rhythmic mid temporal theta was noted as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Infrequent, left temporal focal slowing noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic mid temporal theta is a normal variant, but somewhat more irregular slowing is outside of the range of normal for an adult of this age.  These findings were noted on a previous EEG.  Neither study identified epileptiform activity.  If seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged study or an outpatient study capturing one of her spells may be of value.
