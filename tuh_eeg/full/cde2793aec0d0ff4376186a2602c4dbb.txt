Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
The waking background is well-organized, with a 25-40uV, 6Hz symmetric posterior dominant
rhythm which attenuates on eye opening.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity.  There is a
very prominent central theta with a sharp morphology. However, it is very irregular and does not
appear to evolve.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, bilateral generalized
Other, Central theta
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The central theta described above is of unclear significance but does not appear to be
