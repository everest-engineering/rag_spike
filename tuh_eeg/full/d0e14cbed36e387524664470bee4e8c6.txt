REASON FOR STUDY:  Intermittent dizziness and stuttering.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
HISTORY:  40-year-old woman with history of seizures from 1995 to 1999, off medications due to delivery of first baby, has had intermittent stuttering and dizziness independently, getting worse.
`
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at 73 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and alpha waves of 20-60 microvolts.  Some of this focal slowing appears slightly sharply contoured but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None
HEART RATE:  60
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing, sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to the etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
