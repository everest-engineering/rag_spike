HISTORY: A 57-year-old woman with renal failure, previous stroke. The patient with paroxysmal episodes, feeling sick, word finding difficulty, and increasing left-sided weakness, evaluate for seizure versus stroke.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
MEDICATIONS:   Dilaudid, others
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Shifting slowing was noted with sharply contoured slowing and sharply contoured delta in phase of reversals at T1. Bursts of arrhythmic delta activity were noted from either hemisphere. In addition, there are bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to,
Background slowing and disorganization.
FIRDA
Sharp waves identified in this sharply contoured record including left anterior temporal or left frontal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded. The background slowing and FIRDA may be due to this patient's metabolic process or underlying cerebrovascular ischemia. The sharp waves suggest a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
