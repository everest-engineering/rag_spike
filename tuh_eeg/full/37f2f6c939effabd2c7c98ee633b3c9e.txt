INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are completed.

DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10  hertz,  30-50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta
activity. Hyperventilation  produces an increased in amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 	78 bpm


IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
