History:	69 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SACCULAR ANEURYSM HAD CTA
HEAD ON 12/16/13, PT PRESENTED WITH C/C OF HEADACHES. PMHX SIG FOR
LT BREAST CARCINOMA. EEG DURING INTRAVASCULAR PROCEDURE.
Medications:	INDUCTION MEDS: PROPOFOL, DESFLURANE, VEC, FENTANYL, VEC,
MIDAZOLAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
Description:
The background is diffusely slow with intermixed excess beta and intermittent diffuse attenuation.
Excessive diffuse  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present.  Overall during the entire study there are
intermittent periods of attenuation. There are also some bifrontal sharply contoured discharges
seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  10:10AM 1st coil was deployed,
10:54AM 2nd coil was deployed. No associated EEG changes.  HR 55
Summary of Findings:
Other, No asymmetric EEG changes during study.
Interpretation:
This is am uneventful 2hr EEG during and angiogram and stent coil placement. There was
evidence of intermittent attenuation and diffuse slowing, which may have been related to
medication vs blood pressure changes.  The sharply contoured frontal discharges are of unclear
significance.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team during the procedure..
