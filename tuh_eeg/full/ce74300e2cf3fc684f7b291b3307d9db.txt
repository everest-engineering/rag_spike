LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  15 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of substance abuse, stroke and hypertension who presents with a change in mental status.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Haldol, Serax, Thiamine, famotidine, Risperdal, nitrofurantoin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consistent of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude beta and delta activity with under-riding beta and alpha.  No sleep is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was not performed.
The test was aborted early since the patient wanted to end the test.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 15 minute EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.  These findings indicate etiological nonspecific mild to moderate cerebral dysfunction.  Excess beta is secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Heart rate up to 120 beats per minute is captured in a single electrocardiogram lead.
