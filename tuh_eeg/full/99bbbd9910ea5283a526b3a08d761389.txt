History: 29 Y 0 FEMALE WITH ONE SEIZURE ON 1(}.18-13 WHILE RIDING IN THE CAR SHE
SUDDENLY MADE A NOISE THEN SLUMPED OVER LASTED ABOUT COUPLE SEC.
PATIENT WAS COHERENT DURING THE EVENT.AND TRYING TO TALK. SHE HAS A SHUNT ON THE R SIDE.
Medications: KEPPRA, NORVASC
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10.20 System; standard 21 electrodes, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV. 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18Â·25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional theta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR IS 100.110 BPM.
Summary of Findings
Focal slowing, polymorphic. occasional. Right temporal
Interpretation
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to occasional local slowing In the right temporal region. This finding is Indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Note that the patient is tachycardic.
