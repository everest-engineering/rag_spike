CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old male with many medical problems, status post anoxic brain injury, tracheostomy, and memory loss.  The patient has new onset seizures.  He comes to the floor and is confused.
.
MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, isosorbide, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a 24 minutes study with photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation was deferred. It is technically acceptable
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a 10 Hz alpha rhythm was identified.  The overall background is at times somewhat poorly organized, more so in the earlier sections than the later sections with intermittent, underlying shifting, slowing, or underlying theta.  There is an asymmetry in muscle with a bit more muscle noted on the left compared to the right.
Minimal drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was awake.  A scant driving response was noted.  Shifting, slowing was noted during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Intermittent, shifting, slowing.
Intermittent background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to Previous EEGs.  Again, no epileptiform features were identified.  The findings described above may be correlated with imaging.
