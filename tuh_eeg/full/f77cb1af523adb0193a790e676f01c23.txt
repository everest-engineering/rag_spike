CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed woman with a strong family history of
epilepsy, refractory tonic clonic, myoclonic, and absence seizures. She has a vagal
nerve stimulator.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is extremely sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In drowsiness there is a rhythmic background with
a posterior dominant rhythm of 6-7, but alerting the patient attenuates the alpha rhythm
and a normal awake pattern is seen. In the transition to in and out of sleep, frequent,
high amplitude frontally predominant spike an d wave and polyspike and wave
complexes are noted. Dyschromia is noted. Photic stimulation serves to awaken the
patient. It also produces bursts of high amplitude frontally predominantly 3-5 Hz spike
and wave activity. Nearly all of these bursts are high amplitude frontal and symmetric,
but on rare occasions there is a pair of discharges in the right frontal region.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized frontally predominant high amplitude polyspike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are compatible with a
generalized mechanism for epilepsy. Although there are 2 wave forms that are
asymmetric, the vast majority of these are symmetric and overall the EEG.should.be
considered more compatible with a primary generalized than a secondary generalized
pattern.
