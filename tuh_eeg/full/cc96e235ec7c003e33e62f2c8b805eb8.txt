CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 31-year-old woman with diabetes, renal failure, hypertension, and past history of seizures and stroke, admitted to the hospital this morning after PEA code.  Now intubated with slow eye movements and body temperature 100.6.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.  No sedative hypnotic medications were utilized.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates a low voltage, relatively continuous pattern, which is relatively featureless.  There is scant beta.  Occasional eye movements were noted with some slow periodic eye movements.  The EEG was reviewed at a sensitivity of 3-5.  Tactile stimulation of the patient did produce scant theta noted in the background.  As the recording continued, the patient's slow eye movement artifacts seemed to be abating.
Heart rate 93 bpm.
IMPRESSIONS:  Abnormal EEG due to marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This acute study recorded at 11:52 a.m. on the morning of the cardiac arrest demonstrates a markedly slow and low voltage pattern.  The overall pattern is relatively symmetric, perhaps slightly more attenuated on the left.  Scant reactivity was noted.  Over the course of the record, the patient's eye movements seemed to be  resolving.
