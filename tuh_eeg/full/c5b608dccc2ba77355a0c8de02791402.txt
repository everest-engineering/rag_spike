CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed woman with Down syndrome and
increasing seizures since 2008-2009.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Vimpat.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes
generous beta. There is excess theta but there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm. Technically,
this EEG history a great deal of artifact and the tech tries to use the 35 Hz filter, but
there is still a fair amount of artifact noted in the background. This overall slow
background is characterized by increasing theta in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No slow spike in wave activity nor focal temporal sharp
waves were identified today. This represents an improvement for this individual who
has previously demonstrated prominent epileptiform activity.
