CLINICAL HISTORY:  refractory post stroke epilepsy with history of status epilepticus, seizure free for many years.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Keppra, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is relatively low voltage, but there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In this low voltage EEG, low voltage rhythmic slowing is noted in the left temporal region and left temporal sharp waves are noted, most of which are in a category of 30-50 microvolts.  As the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles, the subtle focal slowing is seen in more discreet bursts of less than 2 seconds with sharp waves typically left mid temporal lobe, although a handful of subtle low voltage sharp waves demonstrate phase reversal at T3-C3.
Photic stimulation was performed although the patient was relatively drowsy and did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent focal slowing.
Relatively subtle temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's previous EEG was not available for comparison.  This EEG supports a structural or functional process and a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  Of note, for this individual with a past history of status epilepticus and severe epilepsy, the findings today are relatively subtle.
