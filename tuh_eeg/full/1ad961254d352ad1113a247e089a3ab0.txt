History:	66 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM. FOUND DOWN ( TIME UNKNOWN) NOTED WITH 2 EPISODES OF CARDIC ARREST NOW ON  ECMO. PMHX SIG FOR ETOH AND DRUG ABUSE
Medications:	VASOPRESSIN, Heparin.
Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes,  comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and some theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Infrequent frontally maximal sharply contoured waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording. These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to painful stimuli. Heart rate was 102
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse Triphasic waves, few
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing. These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific.
