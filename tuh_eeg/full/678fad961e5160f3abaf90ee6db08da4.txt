EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 10-15uV (low voltage), 8Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  During limited wakefulness there is excess diffuse
admixed 20-35 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during
drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
spindles and K complexes appear.  REM is seen shortly after stage 2 sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Excessive or inappropriate sleep patterns, REM is noted
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  There is also short sleep and REM latency which may be evidence of a sleep
disorder. Further evaluation with a sleep study may be beneficial if clinically indicated.  No clinical
or electrographic seizures are present.
