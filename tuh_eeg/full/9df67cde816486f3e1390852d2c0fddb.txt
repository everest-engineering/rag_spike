DATE OF STUDY:  03/26/2014 to 03/27/2014.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old man status post 12 days of video EEG monitoring with refractory status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Include phenobarbital 130 mg IV q.12 h., midazolam drip, phenylephrine drip, propofol drip, Lovenox, cefepime, vancomycin, and atorvastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection.  The patient was comatose throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the beginning of the record, the background is continuous and diffusely slow with frequencies in the delta range.  A breach rhythm is seen over the left hemisphere.  Intermittent-to-frequent high amplitude spikes were seen at P3, T5, and L1 with a large field of spread.  At times, these spikes are associated with bursts of the frequency activity in the alpha and beta range.  As recording continued, there are bursts of fast activity in the right frontal region with associated possible right frontal sharp waves.  In addition, a few possible left frontal sharp waves are seen.  Over time, the record becomes more attenuated and less continuous, however, never reaches burst suppression.  The epileptic discharges become more sporadic, but continued to be present.  No seizures were captured.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour period of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Periodic spikes and sharp waves in the left posterior quadrant at P3, T5, and L1 in the context of a breach rhythm.
Intermittent discharges in the left frontal region, which may be epileptogenic.
Intermittent bursts of fast activity and periodic complexes in the right frontal region, which may also be epileptogenic.
