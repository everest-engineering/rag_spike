CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman with epilepsy.  In addition, she has had C-spine pathology and a left occipital infarct.  Following her second C-spine surgery, she had more myoclonus, chronic left hemiparesis, and a recent episode where she fell.  This was initially though to be a seizure, but in retrospection describes this as her right hemibody going out on her.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, transitioning to Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This section captured wakefulness through sleep.  The patient reported that she slept very poorly and had a confusional spell between 7 and 7:30 a.m.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The vast majority of this EEG demonstrates a well organized background with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There are other sections of the records where the patient appears to be a bit drowsy with a bit of background theta.  There are rare bursts of focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere, left posterior temporal region, and less often than the right, but there are some bursts noted from the right.  Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex wave, spindles and K complexes.
In wakefulness, rare, discrete frontally predominant spike wave discharges were noted.  These were also quite rare in sleep, and there may be some dyshormia.
EEG review 7 a.m., February 26:  This section of the record was reviewed.  The patient reported feeling confused.  The EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern.  No epileptiform features were noted at that time.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
