HEAD TRAUMA
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (left more
than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. The focal slow on  the left is at time
sharply countoured.  The right temporal regions at times appears slightly more attenuated when
compared to the left.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Stimulation caused a myogenic
artifact but not a marked change in the background.  Hr was 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
regions (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
