CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old female found unresponsive.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern with slow, arrhythmic delta activity superimposed with other sections of the record with more beta frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient is associated with an increase in theta.
HR: 60 to 80 bpm, irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowly.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be appropriate. In addition, it is important to note the patient's medications as could play a role in the beta described above.
