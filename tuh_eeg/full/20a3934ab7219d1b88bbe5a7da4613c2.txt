CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed female with one month of numbness in
the hands and mouth lasting seconds throughout the day.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in Jab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Temporal wicket is noted. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. As the patient transitions to drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of somewhat sharply contoured temporal theta or delta. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for age due to:
1. Occasional shifting right or left temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are nonspecific and can be
seen in many different conditions including underlying cerebrovascular disease. The
wicket described above is a normal variant. There were no epileptiform features seen.
