DATES OF STUDY:  October 27-28.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old gentleman with right MCA infarct, left hemiparesis, and a report of daily convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin taper.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the long-term monitoring unit with seizure and spike detection software.  An attempt was made to sleep deprive the patient who was unable to do so.  This EEG captures wakefulness through deep stages of sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing from the right hemisphere with more rhythmic slowing and disruption of faster frequency activity was observed.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles and the spindles are slightly asymmetric.  __________ slow wave sleep was noted.  The patient is noted to fall asleep __________ and to sometimes transition in and out of sleep.
Practice pushbuttons were noted, but no clinical seizures were recorded.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 24-hour section of EEG monitoring was remarkable for focal slowing seen primarily in drowsiness and the absence of epileptiform activity.
