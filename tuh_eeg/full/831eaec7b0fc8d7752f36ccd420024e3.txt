CLINICAL HISTORY:  Heart failure, hypertensive spell with shortness of breath, loss of consciousness on September 30, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, metoprolol, digoxin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient appeared to be very uncomfortable and tachypneic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is poorly organized.  In addition, there is some interhemispheric asymmetry with an alpha rhythm of 10 Hz, intermittent slowing on the right, but more continuous arrhythmic slowing on the left.  In addition, there are right T1 or T3 sharp waves.  The patient is noted to have intermittent purposeful movements on the right, shifting about on the bed.  She uses her left hand, but the technologist notes that the patient does not seem to use her right hand.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity in the background.
Heart rate:  Irregular with PVCs, 114 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A pattern to some degree of bihemispheric slowing.
An asymmetry with more continuous slowing from the left hemisphere with arrhythmic delta and distribution of faster frequency activity.
Sharp waves from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  What this EEG supports a focal or structural pathology on the left, it raises the possibility of a focal mechanism for seizures.
