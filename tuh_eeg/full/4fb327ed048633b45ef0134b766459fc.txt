History:	61 year old woman with change in mental status.
Medications:	Phenytoin, vancomycin, versed, Trileptal, baclofen
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 12/25/2013 till 12/26/2013.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the EEG in real
time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta >theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There are frequent periods of discontinuity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  No electrographic seizures
are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Discontinuous background, frequent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24-hour continuous video EEG because of moderate-to-severe diffuse
background slowing with subtle slowing over the right.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate to-
severe- diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal slowing indicates
focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No clear electrographic seizures are
captured.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team and the primary  team.
