CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman, who awoke with right-sided weakness and eye pain, found to have a pontine infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Diltiazem, Neurontin, hydralazine, Ativan and trazodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  This is a technical acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of head rocking noted in the posterior region, but there is also some subtle underlying focal slowing in the right occipital region.  Features of drowsiness including increasing beta.
In addition, there is an occasional asymmetry in alpha frequency, approximately 6.5 on the right and 7.5 on the left, although this is an intermittent finding.  Features of drowsiness include a decrease in eye movement and increase in beta and slight prominence in the posterior slowing noted above.  Photic stimulation elicited subtle driving identified bilaterally.
Heart rate irregular 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm bilaterally.
Superimposed focal slowing with intermittent right posterior delta with some involvement on the left.
An alpha asymmetry with slower alpha rhythm on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  There are no epileptiform features, but the possibility of an underlying structural process should be considered.
