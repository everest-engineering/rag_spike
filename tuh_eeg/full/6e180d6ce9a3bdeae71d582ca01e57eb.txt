History:	24yo man with 5 year history of epilepsy.
Medications:	phenytoin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  In wakefulness, there is a somewhat disorganized background with
excess theta.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  No stage 2
Small amount of sharply contoured shifting focal slowing, left greater than right.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates left
temporal focal slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving and extenuates the shifting left temporal slowing.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal, sharply contoured L temporal
Disorganization diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of shifting sharply contoured focal slowing,
left greater than right, that increased with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  There is also a
somewhat disorganized background and excess theta during wakefulness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.
