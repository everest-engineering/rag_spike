CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old right handed male with history of intracranial hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, past history of alcohol abuse, nursing home resident, possible seizures on January 2012.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Sertraline, Lisinopril, Digoxin, Sertraline, Metoprolol, Phenytoin, Acetaminophen

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is completed, hyperventilation was attempted.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow and disorganized.  There is no well defined alpha rhythm.  There does appear to be 6-7 Hz mu noted in the central regions, more so on the right than the left, but there is shifting slowing noted.
Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.

HR:    78 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting slowing with at times a bit more of a central mu noted bilaterally.
3. Intermittent shifting asymmetries at times more disruption of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance.  The central region seemed to be a little less involved than others.  There were no epileptiform features.  In some sections of the record the right hemisphere seems to be
more impacted than the left.  The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude the possibility of seizures.
