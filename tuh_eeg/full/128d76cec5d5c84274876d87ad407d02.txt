History:	78 year old female found unresponsive with intermittant shaking. Patient was also
hypothermic when found.
PMH: left CVA, seizures, HTN
Medications:	Ativan, Dilantin
Sedation:	Lorazepam
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
There appears to be more delta activity over the left temporal region.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is continuous diffuse excessive
EMG activity that obsures large portions of the recording.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited, large amount of EMG
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate to severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal, severe
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because of abundant EMG artifacts, so some findings/
features could have been missed/ obscured. This is an Abnormal 24 minute EEG due to moderate-
to-severe diffuse background slowing that appears to be more pronounced over the left temporal
region.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate-to-severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction. Focal left temporal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly
structural in etiology.  If clinically indicated, a repeat study may be of benefit.
