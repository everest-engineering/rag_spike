History:	48 YR WOMAN WITH INTRACTABLE CPS SEIZURES SINCE AGE 2 AND
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES.
Medications:	BENZTROPINE, DIVALPROEX, LAMOTRIGINE, OMEPRAZOLE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent spikes are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at  F7.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Spikes, frequent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
and focal slowing in the left fronto temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic focus in this region. There is also mild  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
