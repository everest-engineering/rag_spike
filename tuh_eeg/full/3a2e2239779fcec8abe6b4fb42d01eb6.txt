CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male with syncope. The patient is currently hospitalized for osteomyelitis of the left foot, awaiting left foot amputation.
MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Doxycycline, ASA, Metoprolol, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.3 alpha rhythm. Mu rhythm of similar frequency is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this. This is a very subtle focus of underlying delta in the right central parietal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic slowing and slowing of the overall background.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slight slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Subtle focal delta in the right central parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The delta in the right central parietal
correlated with imaging. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a
be obtained.
