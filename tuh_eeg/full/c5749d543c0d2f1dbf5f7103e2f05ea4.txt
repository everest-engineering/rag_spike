CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed female who is a lung transplant recipient admitted for pneumonia, she has uncontrollable jerks/shakiness. Patient has history of depression, spacing out, confusion, short term memory loss and headaches, childhood epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Celexa, Cellcept, Prednisone, Itraconazole, Nystatin, Warfarin, Fentanyl, Ambien, Neurontin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is almost entirely asleep record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. At some points, behaviorally, the patient appears to the technologist to be awake but the EEG suggests that she is sleepy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of this record demonstrates stage II sleep with vertex waves, spindles and K complexes. Brief eye opening with what seems to be an awake state is more compatible with a drowsy state followed quickly by the appearance of vertex activity. In this bedside portable record, there is some artifact and a little asymmetry seen intermittently at CZ/C4.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional clinical information is important to determine the cause of the patient's excessive drowsiness. Because bf the artifact noted at CZ and C4, consider a repeat study in the lab is advised.
