CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old man with GI bleed, status post V-fib arrest with hypotension.  Multiple cardiovascular pathologies.
MEDICATIONS:  Levophed, epinephrine, amiodarone, antibiotics, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 22 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  Patient was intubated and poorly responsive.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage, slow, and featureless.  It is significantly slower in the posterior regions with a small amount of rhythmic theta in the frontal central regions.  Slow eye movements were noted.
Tactile stimulation and auditory stimulation of the patient did not significantly activate the record.  Subsequent sections of the record demonstrate a more slow, rhythmic frontal delta.
HEART RATE irregular, 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Marked background slowing.
Rare bursts of slow frontal delta.
Limited reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be of value.  There was limited reactivity in this EEG, but exposure to sedative medications may play a role.
