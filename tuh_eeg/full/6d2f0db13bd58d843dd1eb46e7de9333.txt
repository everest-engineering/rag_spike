History:	48 Y.O. MALE P/W LEFT SIDED NUMBNESS/WEAKNESS AND SLURRED
SPEECH. NIH 4 UPON ARRIVAL TO ED. TPA WAS ADMINISTERED. DENIED
PRIOR EPISODES. NO PRIOR PMHX. HEAD CT - NO HEMORRHAGE
Medications:	None
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The predominant background is characterized by a 9 to 9.5 Hz, 25-40uV symmetric alpha rhythm
with good attenuation on eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
Brief drowsiness characterized by theta activity superimposed by beta activity.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
