History:	58 YO MALE WITH BREATHING DIFFICULTY + COUGH  PASSED 3 DAYS
PMHX ESRD, ICMP, CAD, DM, HTN, HLD, COPD
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90 irregular  This is a limited
EEG as there is marked sweat artifact.  The patient would refuse to decrease the temperature in the
room below 90 degrees.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
