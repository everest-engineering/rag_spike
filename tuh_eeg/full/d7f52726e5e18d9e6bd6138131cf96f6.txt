History:	26 year old woman undergoing L ICA aneurysm coiling.
Medications:	INDUCTION MEDS: PROPOFOL, FENTANYL, VERSED, ROCURONIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
The recording opens while the patient is still awake.  The background at that time consists of diffuse
symmetric low amplitude fast activity.  Once patient is intubated and sedated, the recording
consists of diffuse spindle-like waveforms admixed with fragmented polymorphic theta and delta
activity.  During periods of deeper sedation, there is voltages decrease diffusely and periods of
discontinuity appear.  Stent #1 is deployed at ~1:03 PM and stent #2 is deployed at ~2 PM.  There
is no change in the background with either of the stents.
Summary of Findings:
Other, unremarkable study
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable ~ 2 hour continuous EEG.  Stent deployment does not produce notable
change in the background.
