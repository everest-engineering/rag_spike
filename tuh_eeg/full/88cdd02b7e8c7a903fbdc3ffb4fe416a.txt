CLINICAL HISTORY:   42 year old male status post hypothermia treatment prior to November 4 for massive MI. Balloon pump followed by profound anoxic injury with occipital changes and refractory status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital,  ASA, Plavix, Phoslo, Heparin, Vance, Clopidonet (?), Fentanyl, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is in isolation.  He has a trach and PEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   The background EEG demonstrates  a variable pattern. Some sections of the record are low voltage with rhythmic monomorphic  theta.  Other sections of the record show epileptiform activity which can be bilateral, occipital.  Occasionally it appears as couplet with epileptiform  activity at Cz and in the occipital regions.  There is also focal epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere and some generalized high amplitude or medium amplitude complexes. The epileptiform  activity can occur in trains.  It waxes and wanes a bit but does not demonstrate definitive frequency evolution. Stimulation of the patient produces and increase in theta frequency activity in the background.
HR:   126  bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow rhythmic theta frequency background.
2.   Intermittent prominent epileptiform  activity, some of which is occipital, some of it in the
left hemisphere,  and some of it is generalized.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform features are quite prominent but are improved compared to previous studies.  No clinical seizures were recorded, and no prolonged bursts with frequency evolution were noted.
