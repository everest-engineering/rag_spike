CLINICAL HISTORY:  Known initially as an  unknown female who had a witnessed cardiac arrest while eating, prolonged CPR, the patient went to hypothermia protocol on the 18th.  She was treated with sedative medications during the hypothermia, but did not wake up afterwards on the 19th, when she was rewarmed. past history:  Cocaine abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG begins at 0550 hours on the 19th, using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Clinically, the patient was intubated, comatose, but had been suctioned just before the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous ongoing pattern of 2.5 Hz repetitive sharp and slow wave activity present bilaterally, most predominant in the centro-parietal regions, slightly more so on the left in comparison to the right.  This activity is present nearly continuously, highest amplitude at C3P3PZ.  Towards the end of the record, it seems to abate briefly, but never really stops and then there is a 6-minute seizure at the end of the EEG.  It does not seem to react to tactile or other stimulation, although towards the end of the EEG, the nurses are turning away from tactile stimulation of the patient.  Passive eye opening did not seem to worsen the activity.
Heart rate:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to pattern of continuous electrographic status epilepticus.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the clinical team and the patient was placed immediately on long-term EEG monitoring with pharmacologic intervention.
