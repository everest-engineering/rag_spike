History:	63 year old male with with history of seizures.
Medications:	Depakene, Dilantin, Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The waking background consists of 6.5-7 Hz diffuse monomorphic theta activity with anterior beta
activity.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right frontal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Underriding fast activity is present over the right frontal
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, right frontal
Breach artifact, right frontal
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 22-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to continuous mild right frontal slowing
and mild diffuse slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction,
possibly structural in etiology.  Breach effect is secondary to the skull defect.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.
