History:	66yr old right handed male with h/o seizures since infancy has 2 seizure types, 1.
GTCS, 2 Picking at objects both followed by confusion.
Medications:	Tegretol, Lamictal
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent focal sharp waves are present in the left anterior
temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7/T3.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent epileptiform
discharges and focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a
potentially epileptogenic focus in this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are
consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy.
