RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric with a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Driving is continuous and shows rare, left temporal theta.  Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex wave, K complexes, and spindles.
HR:  72 to 100 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This 72-hour video EEG was remarkable for:
Multiple events with right-sided shaking without epileptiform activity.
Rare, left temporal theta in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The events recorded were not associated with epileptiform activity.  These events may be non-epileptiform in nature and consideration for another type of process would be appropriate.
