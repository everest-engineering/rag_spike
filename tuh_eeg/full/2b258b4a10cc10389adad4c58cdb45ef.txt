CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old right handed male with episodes of lightheadedness
and dizziness, last CPS 2 weeks ago. Refractory CPS with episodic aura.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Metformin, Aetas, ASA, Amlodipine, Vytorin, Tamsulosin,
Carbamazepine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm in a low voltage record. There is a very subtle rhythmic theta picked up in the
left anterior temporal region. There is occasional left temporal focal slowing. With the
use of a T1, T2 electrode, rare, discreet left anterior temporal sharp waves are identified
in wakefulness and are also noted during photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving but at the end of photic stimulation, there is a burst of left temporal focal
slowing and sharp waves.
HR: 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for
epilepsy. Additional clinical correlation is suggested to determine if the patient's
symptoms of dizziness are related to his seizures, epilepsy, or other medications.
