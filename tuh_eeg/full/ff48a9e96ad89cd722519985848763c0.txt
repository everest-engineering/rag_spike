History:	55 YO MALE TRANSFER FROM SOUTH JERSEY CAPITAL HEALTH FOR
CATHETERIZATION. 1/31 PT PRESENTED W/ LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS FROM
PCP'S OFFICE AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE ACUTE RIGHT OCCIPITAL CVA W/
INCREASED CTN.
PMHX: HTN, HLD, DM2, CAD S/P STENT, LAD (2007 90%), OBESE
Medications:	HYPOKALEMIA, INSULIN, K-DUR, ASA, ATORVASTATIN, CLOPIDOGREL,
HEPARIN, LISINOPRIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 25-40uV, and frequency that at best reaches 7.5 Hz
Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence
of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the T4 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
consistent with the known stroke. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
