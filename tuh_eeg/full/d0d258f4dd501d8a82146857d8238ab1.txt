History:	27 year old woman with new onset seizures in 5/2014 with last episode occurring
several days ago.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to intermittent mild focal left temporal
slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
