History:	26 YR MALE ADM 12/19 FOR ATTEMPT SUICIDE. POST DRINKING. BEING
DEPRESSED.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE,  HYDROXYZINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse 18-25Hz beta activity is present.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
Continuous polymorphic slow activity is present in the right frontotemporal region (F4/F8) region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect. This is an abnormal EEG due to continuous
focal slowing in the right frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
