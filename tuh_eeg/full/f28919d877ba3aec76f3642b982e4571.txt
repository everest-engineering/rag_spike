AGE: 62 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 12/05/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: bedside portable EEG TYPE: 20 minute, EEG TYPE STAT
EEG # : 15-1770
HISTORY:
62 y.o. female with a history of long hospitalization referred for routine EEG for persistently altered MSE after seizure earlier today.	Multisystem injury.
MEDICATIONS:
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications listed SEDATION: none
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited but satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.	Posterior electrodes had to be modified ..
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is symmetric and diffusely slow.	There is a mixed frequency pattern, medium amplitude, with delta, theta and occasional bursts of alpha.	Stimulation of the patient elicits generalized attenuation. Spontaneous attenuations as well as rare triphasics were seen.
Sleep includes vertex waves
Generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY:
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: See above
Hyperventilation : n/a Photic Stimulation: n/a
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal	EEG.
Marked generalized slowing.
Intermittent attenuation
Triphasics
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is EEG supports a diffuse bihemispheric process, such as a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
There are no epileptiform features.	If needed, continuous EEG monitoring may be considered.
These findings were discussed with the team 12/05/2015
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
