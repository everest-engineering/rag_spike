CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old gentleman with a past subdural hematoma, left occipital hemorrhage, admitted with a generalized tonic clonic seizure and incontinence.  Past history of epilepsy, alcohol abuse, and pulmonary hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Thiamine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an asymmetry.  The right hemisphere demonstrates an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The right hemisphere is reasonably well organized.  The left hemisphere demonstrates continuous focal slowing characterized by disruption of the alpha rhythm when the patient is awake.  In addition, there is a mixture of rhythmic and arrhythmic 2-4 Hz activity.  A small, discreet T1 or F7 sharp waves and spikes are noted as the patient transitions to sleep.  In addition, there is also some sharply contoured delta. Additional features of sleep include spindles and vertex waves.  Epileptiform activity is accentuated as the patient drifts off into sleep.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere, maximum in the temporal regions.
Left temporal sharp waves and spikes.
A very minimally disorganized pattern on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left in that the focal slowing on the left is nearly continuous.  If these findings do not correlate with imaging there may be a contributory from the postictal recovery state.
