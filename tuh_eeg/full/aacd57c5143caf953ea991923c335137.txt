TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening with an amplitude of about 20-40 microvolts.  There is a diffuse amount of beta seen throughout the recording.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
