CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old woman with 3 episodes of weakness, shaking, rigidity, but without loss of consciousness.  Spells last 30-45 minutes.  History of depression hyperlipidemia, and trigeminal neuralgia.
MEDICINES:  Tegretol, Fioricet, oxycodone, Neurontin, Elavil, Klonopin, Zoloft, Risperdal and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances under 5 kilohms.  There was a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is somewhat slow with excess rhythmic background theta.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 6.5 hertz, reaching 70-90 microvolts, which can be differentiated from the diffuse background theta and generous frontal central beta.
Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movement and a change in amplitude of the background, but sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, producing an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess theta and slowing of the alpha rhythm are nonspecific findings and can be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  This patient's medications may play a role in the pattern described above.
