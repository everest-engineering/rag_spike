CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old male with head trauma status post subdural
hematoma with cranioplasty on the left today followed by possible seizure characterized
by tonic clonic activity of the eyes. The patient received Ativan and Phenytoin.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Metoprolol, Methadone, Insulin, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placements with 1 channel of EKG which are modified due to the
recent cranioplasty.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed
frequency slow pattern with theta and shifting arrhythmic delta activity. The overall
pattern is quite slow and the focal slowing can be seen from either hemisphere. There á
Is some sharply contoured slowing again Identified from either hemisphere including the
frontal and/or temporal regions. Overall, the activity Is generally slower on the left
compared to the right.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. A pattern with slow activity on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual has demonstrated less in the way of focal
slowing on the right but this is an acute postop patient and therefore the features on the
right may be due to post surgical or medication effect. No prominent epileptiform
features were seen and there were no seizures.
