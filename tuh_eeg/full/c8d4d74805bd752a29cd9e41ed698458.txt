AGE: 114 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min,
EEG #: 151763
HISTORY:
114 y.o. male with a history of HIV, hepatitis C and end stage renal disease referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.	Patient found down.
Demonstrated white cells in CSF
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra is the only medication listed SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically challenging bedside portable record and included a single channel of EKG and generous muscle artifact.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is obscured by muscle and artifact. Underneath this, there is a slow background with 1-2 Hz diffuse delta and some frontally predominant delta
Sleep is not achieved
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal bedside portable routine EEG.
1. technically limited but generalized slowing is identified
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. This may include a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other diffuse CNS process
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
