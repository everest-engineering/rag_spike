CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old woman with a stroke in 2005, dementia, aphasia, and childhood epilepsy. Recurrent seizures after her most recent stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Simvastatin, Levothyroxine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient Is drowsy, poorly cooperative, and has difficulty cooperating. She is accompanied by her family members but remains difficult to console throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is quite agitated despite attempts to console her. Family members are at the bedside. She varies between being somewhat agitated to be being somewhat Consequently, there is a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact. The EEG includes slow, 4-7 Hz activity in the temporal region. There is a bit more rhythmic 6-7 Hz activity in the left frontocentral region with an asymmetry and slower activity on the right. In terms of right/left comparison, there is significantly more muscle artifact
on the left and the record does seem to be a bit slower on the right.

HR: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Question able asymmetry, slower on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Because of the problems described, the asymmetry should be regarded with caution. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat, prolonged tracing capturing sleep would be helpful; however, this  patient may not be able to tolerate such testing and clinical judgment is advised.
