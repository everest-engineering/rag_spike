CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 47-year-old right-handed male with a history of seizures, hypertension, and schizophrenia.  This is a followup study.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote, Ativan, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  He is awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background demonstrates a slow posterior dominant rhythm at 7-8 Hz with a smaller amount of background theta.  The patient appears to be quite sleepy and drifting off.  Stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of eye blink artifact and muscle artifact and appearance of posts and vertex sharp transients.  The patient reaches a stage II sleep and fluctuates in and out.  Photic stimulation reveals driving response.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of background activity.  There were no epileptiform discharges or seizures during this recording.  Heart rate 70-80 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and excess theta activity during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings are consistent with mild encephalopathy that can be caused by toxic metabolic degenerative infectious etiologies.  This pattern was seen in his previous EEGs.  There were no epileptiform activities or seizures were identified during this recording.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  The absence of epileptiform discharges does not exclude epilepsy or intermittent seizures.
