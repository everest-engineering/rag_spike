CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy, status post WADA test on the 9th, evaluated for subtle seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lyrica and Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was utilized using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  The system include seizure and spike detection software.  The patient reported no clinical seizures during the record.  There were 2 practice push buttons.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Abundant stage 2 sleep included vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Seizures:  None.
Push buttons:  At 6:20 p.m. and 08:09 p.m.  Both of these were practice push buttons.  No epileptiform features were noted.
Electrographic seizures:  None.
Interictal epileptiform detections:  Primarily in stage 2 sleep, there is a subtle asymmetry with subtle underlying left anterior temporal sharp waves.  These findings are seen primarily in the early section of the record.  This very subtle asymmetry was again noted at 01:26 p.m. with more of an asymmetry in fast activity.
Heart rate 6.0 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Twenty four-hour digital video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
No electrographic seizures.
Very subtle asymmetry and very subtle epileptiform activity with subtle sharp waves noted in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous studies.  No seizures were captured.
