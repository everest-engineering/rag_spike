CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old male with history of bipolar disease, head and neck trauma, MVA one year ago.  The patient recalls the use of Percocet, followed by abrupt cessation and ingestion of 2 muscle relaxing medications, followed by a seizure.  Date of seizure not clear.
MEDICATIONS:  Elavil, benztropine, Abilify.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There was a great deal of muscle artifact in wakefulness and the patient complained of being cold.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The awake record is limited by muscle and motor activity.  There is low voltage underlying 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of beta.  Abundant stage II with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS was recorded.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude and again a lot more shivering.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was awakening from stage II sleep, but did elicit a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta and muscle artifact may be related to the patient's shivering.
