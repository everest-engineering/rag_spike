CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old male with acute left facial swelling, intubated for airway protection with myoclonic activity.  Past history of alcohol and drug abuse.  Possible adverse reaction to etomidate medicines.
MEDICATIONS:  Narcan, heparin, propofol drip, Benadryl, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.  No myoclonic jerks were noted by the clinical team during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is rich in rhythmic alpha and beta frequency activity.  There is a paroxysmal nature to it and intermittent attenuation.  The overall background is symmetric.
Tactile stimulation of the patient did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a mixture of beta and alpha frequency activity.
Intermittently discontinuous record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a pharmacologic coma.  No myoclonus was seen.  No epileptiform activity was noted.
