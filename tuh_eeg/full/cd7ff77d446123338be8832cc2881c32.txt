History:	80YO FEMALE W/ WEAK LEFT SIDE, NOT TALKING, AND LOSS OF
CONTINENCE WHILE IN BED THE NIGHT BEFORE.FAMILY CLAIMS CHANGE IN
MENTAL STATUS. PMHX: DM, HTN, DEMENTIA?
Medications:	Insulin, ASA 325, Metoprolol, Zocor, Enalapril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 8Hz alpha rhythm  Background activity is predominantly
irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  During drowsiness, the background slowing becomes more prominent, and the alpha
rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66 IR
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
