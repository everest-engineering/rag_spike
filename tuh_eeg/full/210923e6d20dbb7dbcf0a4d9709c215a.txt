History:	22 YO MR FEMALE WITH H/O CEREBRAL PALSY, EPILEPSY, ATAXIA SPASMS.
SZS. FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	Keppra, Lamictal, Vitamins
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep architecture was present.
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 75 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of Occasional focal slowing in the left frontotemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
