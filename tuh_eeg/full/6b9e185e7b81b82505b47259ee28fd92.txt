CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old male with dull frontal headache, difficulty with
concentrating and syncopal spells associated with visual scintillations. Attention deficit
disorder.

MEDICATIONS: Adderall

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. The technologist notes that the patient has an unusual hair
cut that makes it difficult for electrode placement.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with symmetric reactive 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm, a small amount of
frontocentral beta and central mu activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.

HR: 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this
record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
