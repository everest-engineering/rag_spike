CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed woman with paranoid schizophrenia history of syncope and convulsions.
MEDICATIONS: Benztropine, Celexa, Klonopin, Geodon, Amlodipine. HCTZ, Simvastatin, Levothyroxine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-defined, 10.5 Hz, 70 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude. With the background, photic stimulation elicits scant slowing.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. A high
amplitude EEG is a normal finding and does not represent pathology. If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study capturing sleep is suggested.
