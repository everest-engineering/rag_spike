MEDICINES:  Lexapro.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 20-year-old right-handed woman, who had an episode of loss of consciousness lasting a few seconds 3 weeks ago.  She slid out of her chair and became rigid with seizure-like activity.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable 20 minute EEG for a tense patient.  Impedances were under 5 kilo ohms.  There was significant muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Posterior slow waves of youth were identified.  Central Mu activity was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm followed by vertex waves and POSTS.  Sleep was fragmented.
Hyperventilation produces muscle artifact, but does not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 54 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG for a young adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Mild bradycardia was identified.
