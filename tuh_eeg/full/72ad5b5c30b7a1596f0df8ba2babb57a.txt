CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old right handed male with epilepsy in childhood, seizure free until 3 years ago when he had a seizure and then another one as if he was falling off to sleep.  His girlfriend noticed shaking and he awoke with a headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient seems quite anxious.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Generous beta activity is noted.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts are seen in stage II sleep.  There are mild shifting asymmetries noted in the vertex waves.  Lambda is noted in wakefulness.  Photic stimulation is initiated when the patient is falling asleep and does not clearly activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are mild shifting asymmetries of the vertex waves which may be due to head measurement or a humid environment.  No epileptiform features were noted.  If additional information is needed, a sleep-deprived EEG or prolonged sleep EEG is suggested.
