History:37 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SZS ONSET POST MVA.  PT STATES HAS ABOUT
1 SZ A MONTH. PT STATES BEFORE SZS HAD BLACKOUTS. FEELS STRANGE
DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.  PMHX: MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE, TIA'S,
CHIARI MALFORMATION, DEPRESSION/BIPOLAR/ANXIETY
Medications:	LAMICTAL, TOPAMAX, ABILIFY, ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Had to
stop after 11Hz.  HR was 90  Technical difficulties: T4 electrode artifact seen continuous.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
