HISTORY:
A 25-year-old right-handed with epilepsy since age 15, seizure-free to the last seven months, one to two seizures per year Typical seizures began With loss of consciousness, no aura, and then confusion
MEDICATIONS:
Trileptal and zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In wakefulness, there is an alpha rhythm of 8 3 Hz. There is a small amount of background theta. There were bursts of paroxysmal slowing with an underlying T2 sharp wave. This may be nearly isoelectric between T2-T4 and ranges from a subtle discharge to a more well-defined sharp and slow-wave complexes, typically identified 1n relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation produces small amounts of theta. Photic stimulation elicits synchronous bilateral driving. Heart rate 90
BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal sharp wave.
2. Mild background slowing characterized by excess theta.
3. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The sharp wave suggests a focal mechanism for epilepsy. The background theta is a nonspecific finding, which could be due to this patient's medications or underlying CNS pathology.
