CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old woman with a learning disability and daily spells of loss of awareness, which are different than her usual tonic-clonic or secondarily generalized seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There is no baseline EEG.  This is an awake and asleep record. No clinical events were noted in the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates mild background slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7 to 8 Hz.  There is a subtle asymmetry with attenuation of the theta frequency activity in the right temporal region as compared to the left.  In drowsiness, there are some bursts in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with a subtle, underlying left temporal sharp wave identified on rare occasions.  Snore artifact is seen. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
HR:  72 BPM.
