History:	47 year old man with 2 episodes of loss of consciousness in the last 30 days.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is low voltage and characterized by 18Hz alpha rhythm (fast alpha variant),
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Generous symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontocentral regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, diffuse beta activity becomes prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates
and becomes intermittent. Symmetric vertex waves and POSTS appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces a strong symmetric photic driving response.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
