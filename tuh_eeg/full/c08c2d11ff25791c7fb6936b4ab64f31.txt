CLINICAL HISTORY:  85 year old man with dementia, diabetes, and previous CVA, strokes, and seizures, now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Heparin, Citalopram.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background that at best reaches 8 Hz and appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is minimal frontocentral beta, and there is excessive theta in wakefulness.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Excessive theta in wakefulness at a frequency of 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology, but at times may be seen in demanding illness, bilateral structural disease, or toxic metabolic encephalopathies.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
