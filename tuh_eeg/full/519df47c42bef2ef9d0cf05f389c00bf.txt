CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy following measles encephalitis.
MEDICATIONS: Zonisamide, Trileptal, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is poorly organized.  It is sharply contoured and there is a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact.  There are bursts of rhythmic, higher amplitude delta activity, as well as a fair amount of artifact throughout the record.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited baseline EEG due to the dramatic amount of muscle movement artifact, as well as double phase reversing artifact but abnormal due to:
Generalized background slowing and disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These technical issues should be resolved so that better caliber recording can be obtained.
