CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old female with carotid artery disease on the left found by primary-care doctor.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Preop left CEA.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is only recorded in wakefulness. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness with a slow posterior dominant rhythm.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness with a slow posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
