CLINICAL HISTORY:   55 year old woman status post massive stroke on the 18th, status post TPA without benefit and with some hemorrhagic transformation status post craniectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Propofol, Versed, Vecuronium, Hydralazine, Mannitol, Labetalol, Protonix
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This EEG was performed to assess ICP.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The activity on the right is low voltage, slow and suppressed.  On the left hemisphere, it higher amplitude. In addition, there is a left frontal sharp wave as well as some left periodic delta.  The activity on the left is relatively continuous. Medications are adjusted for this patient.  By 6 p.m., there is fast activity on the left, but there are fewer left frontal or frontotemporal sharp waves.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Remarkably suppressed pattern on the right.
A variable pattern on the left, but with occasional left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of both hemispheres.  The sharp waves in the left frontal region may part of this bihemispheric insult.
