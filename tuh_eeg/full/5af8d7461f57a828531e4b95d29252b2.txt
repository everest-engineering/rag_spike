CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old left-handed gentleman who has developed episodes with profusely sweating, tingling, right arm shaking as if he is out of his body.  Patient is aware and cannot make the symptoms stopped.  History of cardiac disease with chest pain with hyperventilation or exertion.

MEDICATIONS:  Effexor, Plavix, metformin, trazodone, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.  It was a technically satisfactory study with impedances under 5 kilohms.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 hertz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  If this individual continues to have symptoms, a repeat study capturing one of his spells may be a value.
