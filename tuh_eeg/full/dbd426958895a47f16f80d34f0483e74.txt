CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed male with new onset seizures in 2000
with generalized tonic-clonic seizures with incontinence of bowel and bladder. Seizure free since 2005, but recurrent seizures in the last 4 months. Positive family history of
epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm, but
the overall background is slightly disorganized. In relaxed wakefulness, there is a single
left temporal sharp wave. In addition, there is a single notched burst of slowing noted in
hyperventilation. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response. There is also a
bit of paroxysmal slowing seen in photic stimulation, compatible with a drowsy state. A
single left frontal sharp wave F2 was also noted.

HR: 55 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A mild degree of background disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were single isolated soft epileptiform features.
Well-defined epileptiform activity was not apparent and consideration for either a focal
or a generalized mechanism for seizures may be undertaken. A followup sleep deprived
study could be helpful to more completely evaluate epileptiform activity.
