CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old woman with epilepsy since her teenage years, left hemiatrophy syndrome.  No recent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Depakote, Zonegran, Boniva, Peridol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is rich in beta frequency activity.  There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is intermittent slowing in the left hemisphere with isolated, left focal slowing.  Features of drowsiness include an increase beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Prominent eye blink artifact was observed in wakefulness and in the transition to drowsiness.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in muscle and beta.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Occasional, subtle focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous EEGs, there is significantly less epileptiform activity.  No TIRDA was noted on the left and no sharp waves were noted from the left or right.
