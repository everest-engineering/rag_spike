History:	63 year old woman with a history of seizures, with last reported seizure in 6/2015.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Continuous moderate amplitude prominent rhythmic theta activity is noted over the bitemporal
region.  Its is present during wakefulness and during drowsiness but it does not evolve.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Other, continuous, bitemporal rhythmic theta activity
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24 minute EEG due to continuous rhythmic bitemporal
non-evolving theta activity. This could represent a sign of bitemporal focal cerebral dysfunction.
Ultimately, significance of this activity is uncertain.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
