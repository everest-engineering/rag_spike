CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed male with traumatic brain injury in 2011, subsequent development of epilepsy, now admitted after a jaw fracture on the 18th.  Patient subsequently had a tonic-clonic movement with head turning to the right which resolved spontaneously.

MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Clindamycin, Dilantin, Decadron, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The technologist had difficulty with precise electrode placement due to the wires attached to the patient's head.  Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the technical limitations, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm which is a little bit easier to identify on the right compared to the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy there is generalized background slowing.  In addition, there is superimposed focal slowing with a bit more theta and delta on the left in comparison to the right.  There is a suggestion of a breach rhythm with accentuation of beta in the right central region. Sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR:    96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Focal slowing observed from the left hemisphere.
3. What may have potentially been a breach rhythm noted from the right central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG differs substantially from the previous EEG.  There is more focal slowing on the left.  Neither EEG has identified epileptiform activity.   In this individual with refractory, posttraumatic epilepsy, as he recovers from the current injuries, consideration for a follow-up study may be of value.
