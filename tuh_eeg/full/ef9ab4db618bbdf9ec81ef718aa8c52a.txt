CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old woman with epilepsy for the last 21 years, but seizure free for the last 2 years, history of a sleep disturbance.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage. There is a symmetric reactive 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Mu rhythm is identified, as is some wicket activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. During photic stimulation eye flutter is asymmetric, but a symmetric driving response is noted.

HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed. There are multiple normal variants. The somewhat asymmetric eye flutter may suggest that electrode placement may have been suboptimal. If there are any questions a repeat study with specifically eye leads and a study all the way to stage 2 sleep can be helpful to characterize this individual's epilepsy.
