CLINICAL HISTORY: 	29 year old male, admitted August 27, 2009 after a motorcycle accident. Multiple traumas including multiple cranial traumas with diffuse cerebral edema. Evaluate for severe cerebral trauma/brain death.

MEDICATIONS:   Dilantin, Fentanyl, Midazolam, Famotidine, Morphine, Lasix, imipenem, Tylenol, Heparin, Vasopressin, Epinephrine

INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient is ventilated and comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates very low voltage, generally featureless and suppressed pattern. This is a dynamic record. Some sections of the record demonstrate a more featureless and even somewhat discontinuous record than others. Eye movement artifact is observed. Although there is little in the way of reactivity to tactile stimuli, there is some variability in that some portions of the record are more continuous and have a little richer cerebral background.

HR: 	140 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Low voltage, initially very suppressed pattern.
2. 	Absence of reactivity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG recorded more than 2 weeks cerebral injury in the absence of anesthetic levels of sedative/hypnotic  medication supports severe cerebral injury. There is, however, some cortical activity identified.
