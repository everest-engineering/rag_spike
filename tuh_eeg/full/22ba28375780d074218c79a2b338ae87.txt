History:	69 year old woman undergoing right ICA stenting.
Medications:	ROCURONIUM,SEVOFLURANE,HEPARIN,PROPOFOL,PHENYLEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Patient is awake early in the recording.  The PDR consists of a moderate amplitude well formed
and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Burst suppression is achieved when
patient is intubated.  The background recovers to a mixture of diffuse polymorphic theta, delta and
underriding fast activity, at times occurring in bursts.  Periods of background discontinuity and brief
frank burst-suppression are observed intermittently  throughout the recording.  These changes
correspond to changes in the doses of anesthetic medications used.
A right ICA stent and R ICA coil are deployed at ~11:40 am and ~12:10 pm, respectively.  There is
no change in the background following these interventions.
Summary of Findings:
Other, no change with coil and stent insertion.
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable 2 hour 30 minutes continuous EEG monitoring performed during IR-guided
insertion of the R ICA coil and stent.
