CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed woman with history of frontal brain
abscess followed by stroke, appeared seizure free since 2004, but with 6-month history
of memory loss.

MEDICATIONS: Oxcarbazepine.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was completed.
The patient declined photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 50-70 microvolt's and generous amount of low
voltage frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation was performed in the early record
producing an increase in the amplitude of the background. This was followed by
drowsiness with rhythmic slowing, vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and abundant
POSTS are observed as the patient transitions in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.

HR: 90bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. Characteristic features of a previous craniotomy or cerebral abscess were not apparent. There were no previous records available for comparison.
