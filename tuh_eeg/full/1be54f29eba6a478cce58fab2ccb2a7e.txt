REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status. Anoxic brain injury.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior, temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake and fully responsive.  Activation procedures were not performed.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Eighty-two-year-old man with status post BEA code for 5-10 minutes, EEG for anoxic brain injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, ciprofloxacin, ticlopidine, Zosyn.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some chewing artifact was seen throughout the recording, causing myogenic artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals absence of a posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta.  Overall, there is delta theta, mainly delta/theta background with mainly frequencies around 6 Hz seen diffusely. There appears to be some bioavailability to the EEG and some reactivity.
No normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Mild to moderate generalized slow waves at 5-6 Hz, seen continuously throughout the recording.
Seizures none.
Heart rate is 102 with frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
