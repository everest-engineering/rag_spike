CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, no clear-cut
complex partial seizures but 2 episodes in the morning in the last 6 months where he
felt unwell. Both were associated with sleep deprivation or stress. Prominent family
history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Topamax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were completed. This is an awake and very briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
symmetric, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by the alpha rhythm to
approximately 8.3 Hz, 50 microvolts, and slow-rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation
produces some slowing of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although previous EEGs are infrequent, no temporal or
generalized epileptiform features were observed in the EEG today. The previous 2007
EEG was available for comparison.
