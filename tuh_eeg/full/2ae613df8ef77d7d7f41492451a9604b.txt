History:	53 YO MALE FOUND DOWN, NEXT MORNING, AFTER NIGHT OF DRINKING AND
TAKING INSULIN INJECTION BEFORE EATING SOUP FOR DINNER 9;00 PM
PMHX: DM, HTN, GERD, ESOPHAGEAL CA..
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, METOPROLOL, ATIVAN, PROPOFOL DRIP, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  At times some central faster frequencies are noted.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 102  Technical difficulties:
Continuous movement artifact, sweat artifact and T6 electrode artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
