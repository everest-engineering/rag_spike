History:	67 YO FEMALE, R. HANDEDNESS,  DX. W/SEIZURE DISORDER, ALSO CARDIAC
ISSUES.  LAST SEIZURE APPROX. 2 MO. AGO.  AURA- SCARY FEELING.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PLAVIX, ZOCOR, ASA81, LOPRESSOR, FERGON, OSCAL, DIOVAN,
ZOLOFT, SYNTHROID
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 more than T4 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  At times this is sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG. The record reveals evidence of independent
bilateral (left more than right) focal cerebral dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which are non-specific with regards to etiology.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
