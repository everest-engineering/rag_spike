CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed female with left occipital encephalomalacia, question left frontal encephalomalacia, thinning of the corpus callosum, and child onset epilepsy, seizure-free for 8 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax 800 mg per day.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Intermittently in what appears to be relaxed wakefulness there are bursts of paroxysmal higher amplitude and bursts of theta activity.  As the patient transitions toward a drowsy state, some of these seem to be a bit more prominent in the left frontal region bilaterally.  There is no definitive left frontal sharp and slow wave complex noted with these bursts.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, also increasing some of the paroxysmal bursts which are, on the whole, relatively symmetric.  At the end of hyperventilation, another one of these higher amplitude paroxysmal bursts is noted, but again without definitive spike and slow wave activity.  As the patient transitions toward drowsiness, some of the paroxysmal bursts have subtle focality with a subtle right central temporal sharp wave.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Paroxysmal bursts of sharply contoured frontal theta with a questionable underlying left frontal sharp wave.
Subtle focal features in the right hemisphere including the central temporal region in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no definitive epileptiform features.  Some of these findings are similar to previous EEGs.  The prior EEGs have reportedly demonstrated epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, not the left.
