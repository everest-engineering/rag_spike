CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old man with a history of mental retardation, seizures, and schizophrenia.  His seizures were described by the house manager as shaking with eyes rolling backward.  This was a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, carbamazepine, and risperidone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1-channel of EKG.  Activation procedures included photic.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, there is alpha of 7.5 Hz frequency and 40-50 microvolts in amplitude which is bilaterally asymmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness was characterized by slowing of the alpha and anterior spread of alpha.
Photic stimulation did not reveal any abnormal discharges.
Heart rate:  78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to mild slowing of the alpha bilaterally.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The mild slowing bilaterally is suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in etiology.  There were no frontal sharp waves seen on this recording which were noted in his previous EEGs.
