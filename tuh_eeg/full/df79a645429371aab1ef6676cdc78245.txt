CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male with acute right MCA infarct, change in mental status, acute shortness of breath.

MEDICATIONS: Cefepime

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is awake with a relatively rhythmic but pattern with generous 6-7Hz activity noted bilaterally, particularly in the central regions. The overall amplitude is low voltage, and even when the patient is awake with eye opening and eye closure, there is no well-defined alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and a lower voltage more featureless pattern in sleep.

HR: 114 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage and slow pattern.
2. Absence of an alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this individual with a history of stroke. There were no focal features noted. If additional information is needed, a follow-up study when the patient is out of the ICU is suggested.
