CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old male with a severe pneumonia thought to be PCP
pneumonia with a respiratory arrest of either 15 or 30 minutes duration, now with persistent myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS: Zosyn, Depakote, Ativan, Rocuronium
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is examined during the EEG. He has a T. max of 104 and frequent body jerking. He receives an infusion of Depakote during the EEG. This is a 3.5 hour EEG
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern. There are brief epochs of activity lasting 2 seconds in duration which are high amplitude with a high amplitude 2-300 microvolt frontally predominant, sharp and slow wave complex followed by delta. In the interim, the background is suppressed. The discharges typically occur 2 in a 20-second period, or approximately every 5-6 seconds and are approximately 2 seconds in duration. Stimulation of the patient does not seem to augment these. Of note, the discharges are slowing over the prolonged record. They are a bit shorter in duration and there is a little less associated jerking. Looking at the record as a whole, some of the jerking was likely without a cortical signature and with the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent these isolated approximately 2-second bursts of high amplitude sharp activity with delta are noted.
HR: 116 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A burst suppression pattern identified approximately 18 hours after cardiac arrest.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings carry a worrisome prognosis. These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
