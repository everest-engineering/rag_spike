History:	70 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS FROM FACILITY WITH NO SZ H/O. PMHX SIG FOR
DEMENTIA, GERD, DM2, HTN, CVA AND MI. NOTES FOR READMISSION ON
7/16/14 TO JEANS HOSPITAL HYPOX_?, AND AKI   /// AIDE THAT CAME WITH
PT COULD NOT PROVIDE HX
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm was at best 7Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some
state changes are noted.
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (right
more than left), with an associated loss of faster frequencies over the right.  Some intermittent
sharply contoured discharges can be seen over both temporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good
cooperation, and produces no effect.  HR was 72 with frequent PVC's.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral (R>L) temporal, anterior, Associated loss
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, possibly structural in
origin. Particularly over the right  the loss of faster frequencies suggest a cortical or gray matter
involvement of the lesion. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Called the SNF and informed them of the findings.
