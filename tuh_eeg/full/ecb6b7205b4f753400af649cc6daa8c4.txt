CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed female, status post right temporal
lobectomy with ongoing complex partial epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Metformin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly
responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow, mixed
frequency pattern. In the left hemisphere there is primarily theta. From the right there is
a mixture of theta and delta. A breach rhythm is characterized by an increase in faster
frequency. activity in the right frontotemporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces
an increase in faster frequency activity.
96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves were seen from the right or left temporal
region. In comparison to previous EEGs, this is slower than many of the other studies
and is among the few studies that have not shown definitive epileptiform activity.
