CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old right handed woman with long standing history of narcolepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Naprosyn, Levothyroxine, ASA, Dextroamphetamine, Paxil.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.   Photic stimulation was performed.
LENGTH OF RECORDING:  23 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and regulated 10 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Excess beta is observed.  No sleep is captured.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation results in appropriate occipital driving at mid-to-high range frequencies.
HR:  Regular.
FINDINGS:
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only, 23-minute EEG.  Excess beta could be a result of medication, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, but stage 2 sleep was not achieved.  If clinical diagnosis of epilepsy remains, a repeat EEG with sleep capture may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
