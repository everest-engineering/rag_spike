History:	38 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Patient only experiences auras
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 11-12 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Right temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity
(TIRDA ) is frequently observed.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent, right
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right temporal, mild
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 28-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to nearly continuous mild right
temporal slowing that is intermittently rhythmic (TIRDA). These findings indicate focal structural
right temporal abnormality with epileptogenic potential.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
