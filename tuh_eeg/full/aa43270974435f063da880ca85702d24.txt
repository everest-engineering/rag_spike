History: 25 YR MALE WITH TBI WITH DEPRESSED RIGHT PARIETAL SK FX SIP CRANI AND CODMAN PLACEMENT. NOW EEG FOR PRE PENTOBARB. WHICH Will START POST SWAW (?) PT WITH COOLING BLANKET 95.8 TEMP NO BONE FLAP RIGHT
Medications: Fentanyl, Versed, Keppra and Vecuronium
Sedation:
EEG Type: Continuous (input, video}, 24 hrs
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes

Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. The right hemisphere appears to be almost suppressed. No normal $leap architecture was present.

Right hemisphere is almost completely suppressed. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Attenuation. Continuous, severe. Right hemispheric

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators or moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In addition the attenuation noted over the right hemisphere may be indicative of cortical damage to this region.
