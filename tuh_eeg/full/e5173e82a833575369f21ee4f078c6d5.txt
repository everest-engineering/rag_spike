CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old man with a longstanding history of seizures with generalized tonic/clonic seizures.  The patient has been seizure-free for 4 days.  The patient is alert, yet mildly confused at the time.  This is a follow-up EEG from a previous EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 anterior temporal electrode and EKG electrode.  Drowsiness was recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opened to a very diffuse slow background with delta and theta frequency.  Drowsiness was characterized with increase in background slowing with the theta frequency at 5 to 6 Hz, vertex and posts.  Photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.   Right T4, T2 sharp waves were noted infrequently.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves on right temporal, which are markedly reduced from the last EEG.
Diffuse slowing.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal sharp waves in the right temporal.
Diffuse slowing pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Focal sharp waves in the right temporal region suggest a new mechanism for seizures.  Diffuse slowing may indicate diffuse overall dysfunction which is nonspecific in terms of etiology.  No seizures were seen.  In comparison to previous EEGs, this EEG is improved, background not as slow, fewer sharp waves.
