CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old male with hallucinations with dementia.

MEDICATIONS: Oxybutynin, Atenolol, Colchicine, Lasix,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This Is an awake and drowsy
record with photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG
demonstrates mild background slowing and disorganization with an alpha rhythm of 8 to
8.3 Hz. There is a bit of shifting arrhythmic delta from either hemisphere, left greater
than right, particularly in the temporal region. Wicket is observed. Photic stimulation
does elicit a driving response.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The wicket described is a normal variant and appeared.
In the context of shifting asymmetry wicket can look more epileptiform, but there were
definitive spikes noted.
