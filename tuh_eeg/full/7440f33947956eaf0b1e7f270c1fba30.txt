History:	61 year old woman with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness that is preceded
by severe vertigo.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The expected AP gradient is present.  During drowsiness, the
alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity
is present in the right anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, right temporal, anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute portable EEG due to continuous moderate left
anterior temporal focal slowing and intermittent moderate right anterior temporal focal slowing.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the left anterior temporal
region.  Intermittent focal slowing  is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
