History:	49 year old woman admitted with right parietal hematoma.
Medications:	Valproic acid
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
There is right to left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left hemisphere consists of 9.5-10 Hz PDR with preserved AP gradient and
excess polymorphic theta activity.  There is no PDR or AP gradient over the right.  The background
over the right hemisphere consists of polymorphic continuous theta and delta activity, most
pronounced over the temporal region.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz
rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during
drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric, most pronounced over the
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
continuous focal moderate right hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the temporal region.
Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is seen in encephalopathy, increased ICP and
bilateral deep white matter lesions.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
