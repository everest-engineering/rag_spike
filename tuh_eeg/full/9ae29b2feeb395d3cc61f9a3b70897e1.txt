History:	45 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	DILANTIN, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The background consists of polymorphic low amplitude 8-9 Hz activity posteriorly, poor AP gradient
and excess polymorphic theta activity.  The background improves during sleep: symmetrical sleep
spindles and vertex waves are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 49 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 28-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 49 bpm.
