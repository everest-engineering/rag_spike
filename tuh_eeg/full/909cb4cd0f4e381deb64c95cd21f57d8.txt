CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old right handed woman with multiple seizures occurring
almost on a monthly basis characterized by a feeling of dizziness, followed by
confusion, which may last up 15-20 minutes. The patient has a history heart failure.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and
disorganized with some sections that are reasonably well organized with an 8.3 Hz
alpha rhythm and then shifting arrhythmic delta activity. In addition to the shifting
arrhythmic delta activity there is some paroxysmal bilateral delta and in a sharply
contoured background with wicket activity, there also appears to be some left temporal
sharp waves noted in early drowsiness. As the patient becomes drowsy, arrhythmic
delta activity can be identified from either temporal region, but more so from the left than the right. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 84 bpm and Irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized pattern.
2. Prominent shifting slowing.
3. In this sharply contoured background there does appear to be a left mid temporal
sharp wave.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for
epilepsy.
