LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 23-year-old man status post a gunshot wound to the head.  He subsequently underwent right frontal EVD placement status post craniotomy.  He now has episodes of left eye deviation x3.  He was subsequently given Ativan.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Ativan (6 mg total), Ancef, gentamicin, etc.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The majority of the background consists of low amplitude slow, diffuse polymorphic delta activity with under-riding faster frequencies and bursts of spindle-like diffuse waveforms.  Higher amplitudes are observed over the right hemisphere with more pronounced under-riding fast activity over the right hemisphere.  There is no clear evidence of reactivity to noxious stimuli.  However, it appears when the patient's head was moved the background changed for approximately 10 seconds, and frequently consisting of polymorphic mixture of diffuse theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.
Higher waveforms over the right hemisphere.
Breach over the right hemisphere.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal comatose 21-minute EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse background slowing.  Higher amplitudes with faster activity over the right hemisphere indicates breach rhythm.  Breach rhythm is seen after a skull defect.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured.
