REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old man with a history of HIV, hypertension and a stroke who presents to the hospital with a episode of a witnessed seizure at home and in the emergency room.   There is no description of the seizure in the chart.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some multifocal artifact.

MEDICATIONS:  Chlorhexidine, Lovenox, acyclovir, Dilantin, famotidine.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  At times there is bursts of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves of 2-4 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.  At time it appears to be slightly more focally low over the left temporal region, but not clearly.  Intermittently between the generalized slowing there is bursts of beta diffusely seen.
2. At one point the EEG reveals an increase in muscle activity with slight increase in the background frequency.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  However, the intermittent beta bursts suggest the possibility that this maybe at least in part to medication effects.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
