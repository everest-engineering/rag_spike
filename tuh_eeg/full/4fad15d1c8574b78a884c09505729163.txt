Medications:	DILANTIN, ATENOLOL, LISINOPRIL, ISOSORBIDE, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 102 irregular
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of Mild excessive theta in
wakefulness,  This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral
