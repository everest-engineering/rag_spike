CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman status post left parasagittal meningioma resection, seizure free, medication reduction in place.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This patient has a left central craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Breach rhythm was characterized by an increase in amplitude of the background, this is a little bit more notable in sleep.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and POSTS.
In sleep, focal slowing is noted primarily left frontal central or left posterior temporal.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep, but did elicit a driving response.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background, as well as an increase in faster frequency activity and a subtle accentuation of the breach rhythm.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly central and mid to posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the sixth EEG for this adult which identified focal slowing ipsilateral to the meningioma.  None of them have identified sharp waves or spikes.
