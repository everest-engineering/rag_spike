CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with recent diagnosis of tonic-clonic seizures in April 2013, recurring May 2014.
MEDICATIONS:  None recorded.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable 1 hour EEG with impedances under 5 kilo ohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  There is some intermittent, left or right temporal rhythmic theta noted in the transition to stage 2 sleep, which includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and is this relatively low voltage EEG, there is a slight asymmetry with a bit of focality in the left during hyperventilation only.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 1 hour EEG was remarkable for relatively subtle focal response to hyperventilation with a bit more slowing on the left relative to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd EEG for this patient with recurrent seizures. Neither EEG identified epileptiform activity.  The focal slowing described in the previous EEG was not as prominent today.
