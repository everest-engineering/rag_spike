CLINICAL HISTORY:  37 year old man with seizures since 2000, recently ran out of medications, with complaints of tonic clonic seizures with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta seen.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep. Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
occasional left mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is not specific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
