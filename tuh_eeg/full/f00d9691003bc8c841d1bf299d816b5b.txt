TODAY WHILE TEACHING, HE DID NOT FEEL AS THOUGH HE HAD A SZ. PMHX.
CVA, SZ.
Medications:	CARBAMAZEPINE, GABAPENTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal region
(right more than left) with a more anterior field at times occurring during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  At times the focal slowing has a monomorphic appearance for seconds on the
right.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (R>L) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent focal slowing present
independently in the bilateral midtemporal region (right more than left).  This finding is indicative
of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
