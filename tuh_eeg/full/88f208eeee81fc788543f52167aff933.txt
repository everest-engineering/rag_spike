CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 29-year-old woman admitted with a severe asthma exacerbation, cyanotic, and then with a tonic clonic seizure on admission on 11/22/2012, followed by postictal myalgias and arthralgias.  The patient continues to feel unwell and complains of generalized weakness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm which is better identified on the right compared to the left.  There is excess theta noted in the background bilaterally and there is a small degree of disorganization.  Head rocking artifact was also noted.  Occasional, rhythmic frontal theta is noted.
Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  As the patient becomes drowsy there are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, a bit more so on the left than the right.  Frontal stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Slowing and disorganization.
An asymmetry with disrupted on the left compared to the right.
FIRDA which is sometimes a bit asymmetric, a bit disrupted on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may represent a dynamic, toxic metabolic pattern, or a post anoxic pattern.  The pattern also raises concerns for a potential structural or functional abnormality on the left.  If appropriate, a follow up study as this patient's symptoms improve may be considered.
