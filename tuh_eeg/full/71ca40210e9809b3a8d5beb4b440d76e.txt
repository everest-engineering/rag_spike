History:	69 YO FEMALE PRESENTS WITH SZ

PMHX: SZ, RIGHT FRONTAL INFARCT, TBI, DM, OT, HTN,
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are
present at P4/T6 region at a rate of 0.5-1 Hz.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, continuous diffuse
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), right posterior quadrant
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs) in the right posterior quadrant region.   These findings are indicative of a highly potentially
epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the right posterior quadrant region.  No
electrographic seizures are present. In addition, there is  diffuse background slowing and absence of
the alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
