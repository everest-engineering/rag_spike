CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old left handed man with history of left central oligodendroglioma status post resection, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, depression, and VP shunt status post placement and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Keppra, Zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike detection as well as seizure detection software as well as patient and nurse's noted events were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some intermittent T3 artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 4 or 5 Hz which does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen throughout the recording.  This is slightly worse than the original introductory EEG.
There is a breach in focal slowing at C3 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Focal slow waves and breach seen at C3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the central region, which is consistent with a known mass lesion resection.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
