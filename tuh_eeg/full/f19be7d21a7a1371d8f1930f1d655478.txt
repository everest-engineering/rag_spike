Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse 18-25Hz beta activity is present.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
Occasional focal slowing is present in the the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect. This is an abnormal EEG due to  occasional
focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was
not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
