CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 36-year-old woman with a gunshot wound to the head in 1982 with tonic-clonic seizures, asthma, and recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 30 to 50 V posterior dominant rhythm. There is nearly continuous focal slowing from the left frontotemporal region.  This is associated with frequent, left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity in the setting of a breach rhythm.  At times, in wakefulness, the left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity is nearly periodic.  As the patient reaches sleep, there is attenuation of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves.  The epileptiform activity decreases in sleep.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and may have accentuated the epileptiform activity and focal slowing. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is awake.  There is frequent focal slowing and epileptiform activity identified during photic stimulation. Despite this, a brief driving response is seen.
HR:  68 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent, left anterior temporal spike and slow wave activity, which is at times nearly periodic.
Focal slowing from the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left, as well as a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  Given the dramatic frequency of seizures, consideration of an active epileptiform process in a patient who may have had recent seizures is appropriate.
