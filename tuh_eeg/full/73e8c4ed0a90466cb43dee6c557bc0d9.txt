History:	41 year old female with history of cerebral palsy, epilepsy, hep C, moderate mental
retardation. Seizure free for 5 years.
Medications:	depo-provera
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Record is obscured by nearly continuous eye flutter and eye blink
artifact and electrode impedance artifact.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a limited NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. EEG is limited because of eye blink and electrode impedance
