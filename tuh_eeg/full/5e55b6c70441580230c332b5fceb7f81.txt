CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old right handed female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dementia, chronic renal insufficiency, and episodes of fainting for about 2 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Aricept, Hydrochlorothiazide, Risperdal, Zocor
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of loss of consciousness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation is performed with no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There are focal slow waves seen intermittently in both F7/T3 and F8/T4, occurring intermittently at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral focal cerebral dysfunction in the anterior temporal lobes which is mildly excessive for age and nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
