History:	An unknown male found down with left head trauma.
Medications:	Protonix, Keppra, Heparin, Lorazepam, Fentanyl, Zosyn, Vancomycin,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with
voltage attenuation and slower waveforms over the right.  The background on the right is primarily
attenuated with occasional delta activity present.  The background over the left consists of
intermittent 4-5 Hz activity, most prominent frontocentrally.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No clear epileptiform discharges are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate -to- severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, right hemispheric
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing and
focal right hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate to-severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere
indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  Right hemispheric background
attenuation could be related to a fluid collection between the skull and the brain, such as
empyema, SDH, etc.  No electrographic seizures are present.
