CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old male, admitted on the 3rd, found down with repetitive seizures and eye deviation.  Right-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, heparin, and labetalol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient is poorly responsive, and at best is moaning.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, slow record.  It is a low voltage, featureless record with theta.  Intermittent, somewhat paroxysmal slowing is noted with shifting asymmetry, slightly more prominent from the right hemisphere than the left.  Later in the record, the paroxysmal slowing is a bit more prominent on the left compared to the right.
Heart rate 102 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing and disorganization.
Intermittent bursts of shifting, paroxysmal slowing.
Clinical Correlation:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The EEG is nearly as slow as was noted in the first EEG 3/3/2014.
