REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old man with history of a motor vehicle accident in 1970 that left him in a coma for 6 months, who presents with onset of seizures for 2 years with recent seizures, 10 seizures in a day 2 weeks ago.  Follow-up EEG has had 2 seizures, one in May and the last one in June, both with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Amlodipine, carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterotemporal and a single-lead EKG electrode.
The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Stage 1.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen almost frequently at F4/F8 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 millivolts.
At times there is frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right frontal slowing in addition to frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right frontal region which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The FIRDA noticed during the EEG may signify a bilateral white matter frontal lesion or can be seen with increased intracranial hypertension but is usually nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.  This EEG is similar to the one described read on March 22, 2013.
