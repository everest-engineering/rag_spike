CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old woman with epilepsy since age 12, last seizure
11/24/2009.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly slow in the 8.0 Hz alpha rhythm. There is asymmetric eye movement artifact and frequent
eye flutter. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:   66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:
No epileptiform features are observed. The mild
background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and may be correlated with history, imaging, and medications.
