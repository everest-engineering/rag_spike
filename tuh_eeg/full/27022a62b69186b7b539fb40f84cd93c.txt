History:	57YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH FOUND DOWN FOR 25 MIN, WAS A-FIB THEN
PEA.
Medications:	DILANTIN, VERSED DRIP
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 16.5 hours from 04/05/2015 to 04/06/2015.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by severe diffuse
attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Periodic generalized complex polyphasic sharp waves are present, with
a repetition rate of 1 Hz.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 78
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous diffuse
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  generalized periodic epileptiform discharges and severe
attenuation. These findings are consistent with severe diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability
and in the setting of hypoxic injury they forebode a very poor prognosis.
