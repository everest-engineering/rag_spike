CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed woman with epilepsy.  Seizures described as being overheated followed by loss of consciousness.  Also, paroxysmal dizzy spells 2 to 3 times per week.  A 3-month history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11-Hz alpha rhythm with abundant, low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Stage I sleep includes vertex waves.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves and spindles.  Sleep is not sustained.  Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generous beta identified in this EEG is a nonspecific finding and may be due to anxiety or even medications not reported in the medication list.
