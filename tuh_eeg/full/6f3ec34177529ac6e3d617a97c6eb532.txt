History: 86 Y 0 F HAD PEA ARREST @ HOME FOUND BY FAMILY NOT BREATHING.EMS
GAVE 3 ROUNDS OF EPI WITH ROSC.INTUBATED IN THE FIELD LOST PULSE X 10
MIN.
Medications: Zosyn
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine. Awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. Comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present Background activity was severely stowed and attenuated with no spontaneous variability. There are diffuse EMG and noise artifact during most part of this recording. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR Is 40 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, marked, bilateral diffuse
No epileptiform discharges
Technically limited
Bradycardia
Interpretation:
This EEG Is technically limited because of abundant EMG end ICU artifact During brief period of readable record the EEG showed diffuse slowing and severe attenuation of the background rhythm. This record indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which may be due to toxic, metabolic or anoxic encephalopathy or bilateral structural lesions. In the setting of anoxic brain injury this pattern Is associated with poor functional recovery. Clinical correlation and prolonged EEG monitoring are recommended. Note the patient is bradycardic.
