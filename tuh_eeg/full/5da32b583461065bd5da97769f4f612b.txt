CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old right handed female with episodes of right-sided numbness for approximately 6 months with a history of hypertension, COPD, diabetes and diverticulitis.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Accolate, ASA, Iron, Metformin, HCTZ, Omeprazole, Glipizide.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Right-sided numbness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedure including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient reaches stage 1/stage 2 sleep. Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  At times, there is some sharply contoured activity in the temporal lobes most consistent with wickets.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
