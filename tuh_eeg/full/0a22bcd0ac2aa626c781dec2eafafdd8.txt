History:	54 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O HYPONATREMIA, GEN WEAKNESS,
LIGHTHEADEDNESS, DIZZINESS ALONG WITH EPISODES OF AGITATION AND
CONFUSION.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  Rapidly becomes drowsy, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 90 with some PVCs.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Excessive or inappropriate sleep patterns
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
