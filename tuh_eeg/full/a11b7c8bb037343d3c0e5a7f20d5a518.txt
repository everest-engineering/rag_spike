CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with history of seizure onset since
2004, with last reported seizure in April2010. He has past medical history significant
for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and head trauma in 1994.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, Metformin, Lexapro, Clozaril, HCTZ,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, EEG is disorganized. The
background EEG is poorly organized and demonstrates alpha rhythm. There is focal
slowing seen on the right posterior quadrant. There is also seen new activity in central
region of 6Hz, more on the left than on the right. Hyperventilation produces slowing.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR; 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Disorganization.
2. Background slowing

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Findings are nonspecific and focal slowing could correlate
with his history of head trauma and prior history of substance abuse. Previous EEGs
also demonstrate slowing on the left, but no epileptiform activity
