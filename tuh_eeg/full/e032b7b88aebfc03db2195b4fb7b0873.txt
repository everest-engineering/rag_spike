CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with a history of hypertension, anxiety, pancreatitis, and epilepsy since 2006.  Recent seizures 5 days ago.  Seizures may occur with an aura, followed by tongue biting and incontinence.

MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Trileptal, Dilantin , Lisinopril, Metoprolol

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were recorded.  This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized for an adult of this age with an alpha of approximately 8 Hz and some background 4 and 6 Hz activity.  There is a fair amount of movement artifact noted.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record with good effort.  It clearly produces some background slowing, as well as some movement artifact and cannot be considered focal.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient drifts off to sleep, there is some shifting focal slowing with isolated theta or delta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR:    96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG age due to:
1. Background disorganization.
2. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
3. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These are all mild to modest findings.  There were no epileptiform features.  Multiple medications may have contributed to the pattern
described above and a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  A repeat study capturing more prolonged sleep may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity.
