CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old gentleman with dementia, right parietal stroke, aggressive behavior and profound hemiparesis more remarkable than expected for infarct.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Plavix, Aspirin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite drowsy throughout the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage theta pattern which is slightly slower on the left compared to the right with a bit of right posterior quadrant delta. The focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant becomes a bit more prominent as the patient becomes drowsy. In addition, there is higher amplitude rhythmic theta on the right. The overall background is quite slow. Due to the patient's behavior, hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. At some point, the patient has his eyes open and appears to be resting quietly, but the background remains quite slow.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Superimposed rhythmic slowing on the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. The prior dementia may augment the slowing identified in this individual.
