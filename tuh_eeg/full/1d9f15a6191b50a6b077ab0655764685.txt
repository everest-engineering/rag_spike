CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old lady with a history of headaches associated with dizziness for 1 month.  She had episodes of jaw tightening and body shaking without loss of consciousness.  Her last episode was in May.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, Carafate, Prilosec.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel of EKG.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, there was bilaterally symmetric alpha of 11 Hz frequency and 40 to 50 microvolts in amplitude, reactive to eye opening.
Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of alpha.  She drifts into stage 2 sleep after hyperventilation.
Hyperventilation did not reveal any abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake through stage 2 EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG and the previous EEG have not shown any epileptiform features.  If clinical concern remains, an inpatient video EEG monitoring may be helpful to capture events.
