History:	77 YO WOMAN S/P SAH and coil with altered mental status.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Left hemisphere loss of faster frequencies mainly in the temporal
region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left central region.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. The loss of faster frequencies may
signify cortical damage in the same region.  In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
