CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman with schizophrenia, epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures, and recurrent hospitalizations for status epilepticus.  Currently, seizure-free for nearly 2 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  There is some electrode placement issues with this EEG, but it is technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is very low voltage with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
There is significant muscle twitch artifact noted in the background.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult with a history of refractory epilepsy.  No epileptiform features were noted today, but complex epileptiform activity has been noted with many different patterns over the past 4 years.
