History:	57 YR FEMALE WITH H/O SZS SINCE BABY 2' ENCEPHALITIS. PT STATES
ONLY HAS SZ WHEN STRESSED AND SLEEP DEPRIVED DESCRIBED AS DROP
ATTACKS/ LOC.  PT STATES WHEN FEELS ANXIOUS (AURA) TAKES PIECE OF
KLONOPIN AND IT USUALLY STOPS SZ
Medications:	KLONOPIN, TEGRETOL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent independent bilateral focal slowing in the F7/T3, F8/T4 regions.  At times the focal
slowing is slightly sharply countoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces no driving.  HR is 90 bpm
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent bilateral anterior temporal
focal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin.
