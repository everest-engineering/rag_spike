History:	41 YO FEMALE C/C OF CONTINUOUS HEADACHES. BACKGROUND EEG FOR
PRE- IR SURGERY.
PMHX: SZ, ASTHMA, DEPRESSION, HTN, HIV, ANXIETY, INSOMNIA,
UNSPECIFIED SCHIZOPHRENIA, DM, CEREBRAL ANEURYSM.
Medications:	TOPAMAX, KEPPRA, OXYCODONE, ATRIPLA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm. At, times the left posterior
dominant rhythm voltage appears to be slightly lower.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz
activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  Patient was
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior and mid-temporal regions
during wakefulness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid-temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR - 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, anterior and mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild, excess theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
anterior and mid-temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
location. In addition, there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right mid-temporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Lastly, there is
mild  excess theta in wakefulness,  This finding is etiologically a nonspecific indicator of mild
