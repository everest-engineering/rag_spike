CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old male found down status post BA code, found to be positive for cocaine, benzos and opiates.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Protonix, Fentanyl, Versed drip
REASON FOR STUDY:  Unconsciousness.  Altered mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is diffuse muscle artifact throughout the recording which improved with vecuronium given.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow recording with marked attenuation seen diffusely.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.  When the patient is stimulated, there appears to be no increased reactivity in the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slowing with severe attenuation with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 10-20 microvolts at best.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Marked attenuation with lack of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The absence of reactivity
seen in this EEG suggests a poor prognosis.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
