Medications:	AMLODIPINE, LISINOPRIL, MECLIZINE, ZYRTEC, IMDUR, FLOMAX, PLETAL,
ASA, LOPRESSOR, PROTONIX, CELLCEPT, PROGRAF, PREDNISONE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Some wickets seen over the left temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 60 with frequent PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Wicket spikes, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
