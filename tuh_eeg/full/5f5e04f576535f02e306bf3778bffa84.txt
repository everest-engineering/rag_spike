CLINICAL HISTORY:  23 year old right handed woman, 20 weeks pregnant with childhood epilepsy.  Last seizure 2 weeks ago described as an aura with lightheadedness and dizziness.  This was followed by generalized shaking.  Past history of bipolar, depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Seroquel, Zoloft.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes generous beta and theta.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep as is an increase in beta.  Eye movements persist into stage I sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
An absence of a well-defined alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted.  Unfortunately, there are no previous EEGs available for comparison. Medications may produce an increase in beta and theta in this EEG.  The absence of an alpha rhythm is, on rare occasions, a normal variant but may be part of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function in this particular case.  Additional review of previous EEGs is suggested in search of epileptiform activity in this pregnant woman with epilepsy.
