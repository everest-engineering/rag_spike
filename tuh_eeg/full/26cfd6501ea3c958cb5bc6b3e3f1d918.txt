CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old man with episodes of dizziness followed by loss of consciousness and decreased responsiveness.  His last episode was several days ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Percocet, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed in accordance to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude of 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No sleep was captured.  Hyperventilation results in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  There is nearly continuous T3 electrode artifact throughout the recording.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
Nearly continuous T3 electrode artifact.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only, 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persistent, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
