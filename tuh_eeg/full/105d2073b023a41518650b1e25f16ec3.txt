INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement and 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
Patient has a skull defect in the right temporal central region, T4 F8 C4.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 microvolt
alpha rhythm. There is a slight increase in theta in the right frontocentral region. The
breach activity is subtle. Drowsiness is seen, characterized by in crease in beta activity.
The focal theta on the right is intermittent. Photic stimulation accentuates an asymmetry
in the alpha rhythm with decreased alpha seen on the right. Bilateral driving is seen.
The theta is accentuated during photic stimulation. This is seen predominately in the
frontocentral region on the right.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild asymmetry with intermittent slowing on the right.
2.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. There are focal
features that support gray and white dysfunction, congruent with the patient's clinical
history.
