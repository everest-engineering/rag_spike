CLINICAL HISTORY:  87 year old male found down by son with confusion with past medical history of DVT, PE, hypertension, esophageal ulcer, angioplasty, now found to have a right frontal mass.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Haldol, Lorazepam, Hydralazine, Dexamethasone, Insulin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single load EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that appears to be 6-7 Hz, which appears to be at times reactive to eye opening.   There is a lack of the typical frontal central theta and seen more diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at C4/F4 seen continuously at 2-3 Hz consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED'S) seen continuously throughout the recording.  There is additional focal slow waves in the same region.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal central PLED'S,
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in the right frontal central region, which is consistent with a known frontal mass.  No seizures were seen.
In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and may be due, at least, in part to medication effect.
