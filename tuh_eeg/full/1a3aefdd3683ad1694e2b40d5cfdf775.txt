History:	84 YR MALE PRESENTING WITH NEW ONSET SZ AFTER BEING FOUND AFTER
A FALL AT HOME. 3-4 EPISODES (NOT DESCRIBED) FOR 5-7 SECS WITNESSED
BY FAMILY.  HX: ESOPHAGEAL CA, COPD, DMII.
Medications:	OXYCODONE, FENTANYL PATCH, DILTIAZEM, LEVETIRACETAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
asleep, lethargic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at best 6Hz.  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
State changes are noted but no typical sleep architecture is seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
