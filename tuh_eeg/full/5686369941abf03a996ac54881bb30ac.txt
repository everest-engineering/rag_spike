CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 26-year-old, right-handed woman with mental retardation and multiple falls, which are attributed to her epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. No clinical seizures were noted by the nurse or the patient during this 24-hour section.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness the background demonstrates mild background slowing.  There are bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude delta seen in the record.  These are seen in wakefulness and occasionally during sleep.
SLEEP: In sleep, the bursts of frontally predominant sharply contoured activity are identified, again without clear localization.  These appear to be relatively symmetric and there is no definitive spike and slow wave activity seen in association with them.  They persist into stage II sleep.  Other features of stage II sleep include vertex and K complexes.
The bursts of high amplitude delta are typically asymptomatic, but on one occasion at 01:18:15 on July 20, there is a burst lasting approximately 9 seconds in duration.  Six seconds into this, there is jerking movement of the thorax noted.
Additional sleep recording indicates frequent arousals from sleep. The patient is awake throughout much of the night and even during stage II sleep, she is noted to have some automatisms and arousals including scratching or itching her nose without clear clinical correlate. On some occasions, during the drowsy record when she has the bursts of frontally predominant high amplitude delta, she demonstrates semi-bursts of slow activity.
She spends much of the daytime staring off into the television and does not appear to interact much with other individuals.  There is limited testing performed for this individual in wakefulness.
