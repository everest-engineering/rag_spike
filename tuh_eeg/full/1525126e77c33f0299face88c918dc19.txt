CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed woman with a past medical history of HIV, breast cancer, dysrhythmia, status post AICD, now with syncopal episodes last 5 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Lorazepam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncopal episode.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedure including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During the recording, there appears to be an excessive amount of theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  In addition, there appears to be some bursts of more slow frequency waveforms, but mainly in the theta frequency.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
