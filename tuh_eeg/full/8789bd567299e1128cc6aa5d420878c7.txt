CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 71-year-old right-handed male, seizure free for the last 10 years, referred as an.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed, but hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Brief stage I sleep includes rhythmic theta, followed by vertex waves with brief stage II sleep, which was not sustained.  Photic stimulation was performed with a fair amount of muscle artifact and produced scant driving.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study is suggested.
