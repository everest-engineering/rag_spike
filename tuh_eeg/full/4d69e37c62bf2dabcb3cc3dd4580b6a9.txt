CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old left handed woman with stroke; evaluate for complex partial seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Norvasc, Phenytoin, Lisinopril, ASA, Zocor, Bactrim
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed but photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm but most of the record includes a drowsy pattern with rhythmic theta. There is EKG artifact, and there is also prominent left temporal wicket. In this sharply contoured record, there are a handful of left anterior temporal sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 42 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there are a number of normal variants in this record including wicket, there do appear to be sharp waves. An additional recording may be helpful to clarify the epileptiform activity.
