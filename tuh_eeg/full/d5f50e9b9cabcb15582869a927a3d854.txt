History:	69 YO FEMALE PRESENTS WITH SZ
AS IMPATIENT BACK IN APRIL 2014.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm was at best 7Hz seen intermittently.  Overall the background activity
was characterized by diffuse theta more than delta activity during wakefulness with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some state changes were seen.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region with a associated loss of faster frequency and low amplitude.  Intermittent
polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, maximal in the midtemporal region
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere maximal
in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In
addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Lastly,  there is diffuse
background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators
of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
