History:	25 year old male presents with a history of seizures since the age of 12. He has
seizures approximately 3 times per month.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During very brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Intermittent very brief head jerking is noted throughout the recording.  It
improves when patient becomes drowsy. Electrographically it is associated with brief EMG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Other, intermittent, brief head jerks
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake and very briefly drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information. Intermittent very brief head jerking improves when
patient becomes drowsy and is not associated with an abnormal EEG correlate.
