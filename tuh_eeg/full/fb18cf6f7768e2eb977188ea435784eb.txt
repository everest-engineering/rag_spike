CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with epilepsy.  The patient has a complex neurological history, was in a coma in 1972 for 3 months after a motor vehicle accident, past history of an aneurysmal hemorrhage and then an assault in January 2011.  Currently she has spells up to 6 to 8 times per day.  In addition, she also has a feeling of being unwell after walking several blocks.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, lisinopril, propranolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This patient was extremely drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleep:  Much of the record includes stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complex, spindles and POSTS.  The patient arouses briefly.  There are some bursts of posterior predominant mixed theta delta which can be seen in wakefulness or sleep.  There is no specific mention of a craniotomy, but there is a suggestion of a possible breach on the left with a little bit of wicket like activity.
As the patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep, there is occasional, sharply contoured slowing in the left temporal region.
By 8:00 a.m. on the morning of 11/21/2012 the patient is more consistently awake, but by the afternoon she is drifting off to sleep again.  Occasional wicket activity was identified.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal long term video EEG monitoring session for a patient of this age due to:
Occasional bursts of more posteriorly predominant slowing seen in the transition into sleep.
Sharply contoured left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Wicket activity was identified.  There is sharply contoured slowing, but no definitive spike and wave or sharp waves with after going slow waves identified in this record.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.
