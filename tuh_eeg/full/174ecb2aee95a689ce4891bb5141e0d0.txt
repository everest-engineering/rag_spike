CLINICAL HISTORY: 85 year old female with past craniotomy with bur hole at 7FP3, stroke, motor vehicle accident, left skull surgery, mild confusion and ambulatory difficulty.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Paxil, Temazepam, Metoprolol, Levetiracetam, ASA, Paroxetine, Enalapril.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. An awake and asleep record. Photic simulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is very well organized. In addition, it is a high amplitude EEG. There is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. Breach activity is noted with accentuation of the amplitude particularly in the left parietal region. There is occasional focal slowing noted in this same region. As the patient becomes drowsy, this becomes a bit more prominent. Photic stimulation elicits driving response bilaterally.

HR: 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing in the left parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy. No epileptiform features were observed nor was there generalized background slowing as might be anticipated in dementia.
