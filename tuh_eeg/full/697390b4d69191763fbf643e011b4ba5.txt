History:	50 year old woman with complicated PMH, now presents with increase in seizure
frequency.
Medications:	Phenobarbital, depakote, lamictal, benadryl, neurontin, abilify, and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse beta activity is noted.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Prominent POSTS
(positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are noted.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left central region, increasing in
drowsiness and sleep.  Underriding fast activity is present over the left central region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left central
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
Breach artifact, left central
POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 27 minute EEG due to occasional mild central slowing.
This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Breach artifact
could be seen secondary to a skull defect.  Excess beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
