CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old male with diabetes, hepatitis C, previously evaluated for verbal unresponsiveness.  The patient now transferred from a facility for an episode with lip smacking, unresponsiveness, stiffness followed by confusion.  This was considered a seizure.
MEDICATION:  Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG might mildly abnormal due to:
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG for this individual.  Neither study identified epileptiform activity.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.
