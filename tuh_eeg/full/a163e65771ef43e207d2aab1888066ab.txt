CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old male with anoxic encephalopathy, status post code
December 26 lasting 20 minutes, history of paranoid schizophrenia and heart failure
and hepatitis and many other medical problems.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Famotidine, Morphine, Lovenox, Zocor, ASA, Haldol, Lipitor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated but
responsive .
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed
frequency pattern. There are sections of the record rich in 6-8 hertz activity. Other
sections include bursts of frontally predominate rhythmic delta activities. There are also
some sections with arrhythmic delta activity in the posterior regions right more so than
the left. The patient is relatively cooperative and looks about.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.
3. Occasional posterior slowing. No epileptiform features were seen. The occipital
slowing may be correlated with imaging.
