CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman with episodes of nausea, vomiting, incontinence, and dizzy spells.  Past history of stroke, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cavernoma, AVM.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lovenox, and pravastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The patient transitions rapidly into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Heart rate:  66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal bedside EEG without hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be of value.
