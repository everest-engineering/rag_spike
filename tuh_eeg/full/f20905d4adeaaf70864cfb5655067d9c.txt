History:	26 year old man with childhood seizures.  He has not had seizures for many years.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Occasional slow alpha variant is noted.  The AP gradient is
unstable.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.
Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
