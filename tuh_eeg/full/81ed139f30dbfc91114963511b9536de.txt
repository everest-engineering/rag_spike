CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old left handed male admitted earlier this week with status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Lantus, Keppra, Protonix, Folic Acid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The long term monitoring system is utilized with continuous seizure and spike detection.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a remarkably abnormal pattern with a slow lower voltage suppressed pattern on the left and a periodic complex from the right with bursts of suppression lasting 1-2 seconds and then the periodic complex from the right. There is some theta activity noted prior to the periodic complex on the right.
As the recording continues, in duration of time with suppression from the right is starting to increase closer to 3 seconds and there is a bit more rhythmic lower voltage slowing from the left. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
No information is provided over the LTM recording as to changes in the patient's medications, but in the early morning sections, the becomes slower on the left again.
The data can be reviewed at a very slow paper speed. There are brief bursts of activity, but the activity does not evolve. Stimulation of the patient does not appear to activate the record.
By 10:00 a.m. the activity seems to be slowing. There are brief triplets of activity, but no sustained ictal activity and the overall pattern is a quite worrisome pattern. I guess they have more days of reading.
