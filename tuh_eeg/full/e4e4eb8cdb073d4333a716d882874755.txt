CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male status post gunshot wound to the
right side of the face in the 1980s with subsequent development of tonic-clonic seizures:
last seizure a week ago. Seizures primarily occur during sleep.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. There is significant
artifact noted in some of the right temporalis electrodes. Hyperventilation produces
prominent bilateral slowing. Hyperventilation also seems to start to bring out a bit of an
asymmetry, but unfortunately there is a great deal of artifact. Features of drowsiness
include an increase in slowing of the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Prominent facial muscle artifact is picked up in this record.
HR: 66 bpm with a single channel EKG lead demonstrating ST segment changes.
This EEG demonstrates mild abnormalities including:
1. The suggestion of asymmetry with slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's facial injury might have contributed to the
muscle artifact described above. A followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is
suggested.
