History:	75 Y/O FEMALE ON HER WAY TO DIALYSIS.FOUND HER COLLAPSED IN THE STREET .THE EMS SHOCKED HER ONCE AND GAVE EPI. CPR PERFORMED BY EMS WAS DEFIBRILLATED TIMES 1. COMPRESSION BEGAN PRIOR TO ARRIVAL
Medications:	INSULIN, HEPARIN, BENADRYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video}, 24 hrs
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by burst suppression pattern. Bursts consist of a sudden generalized frontocentral predominant sharply countoured disorganized theta and delta frequency discharge. They last around 10-20 seconds. This pattern had an associated sudden irregular facial jerks with the bursts. This bursts stopped at 9:14 PM. After this the EEG became progressively more attenuated over minutes and revealed no electrocerebral activity for the rest of the record. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. HR was 120 slowed down and no HR was seen after 9:48PM
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, Associated myoclonus Electrocerebral inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 4 Hr EEG because of diffuse background attenuation and burst suppression pattern. The associated myoclonus with the bursts is suggestive of a cortical nature for the discharges. All the findings are supportive for severe cortical dysfunction and irritability.The EEG progressed to electrocerebral silence.
