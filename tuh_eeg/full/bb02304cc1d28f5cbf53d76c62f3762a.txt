CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old woman who presents with syncopal episodes. This was followed by several minutes of confusion post event. Past medical history is significant for end-stage renal disease, hypertension, and others. History of prior episode a week ago.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is not performed due to patient on oxygen. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG shows a low voltage pattern. Alpha is 7. 5 Hz. There is excess theta. There is also arrhythmic delta at various intervals throughout the record. There is also a shifting slowing on the right and occasionally on left. Photic stimulation causes driving response with superharmonic drive.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Excess theta.
4. Arrhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings are nonspecific and can be found in ischemic cerebrovascular disease as well as dementia. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a long-term EEG can be performed.
