CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 30-year-old right-handed male with epilepsy dating to childhood.  Seizure-free since age 12.  Typical seizure characterized by staring for 3-4 months.  Childhood diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically acceptable primarily awake EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm at 50-70 microvolts.  Posterior slow waves of youth are noted.  Features of drowsiness include slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Sleep was not achieved, however.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as single burst of shifting slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited subtle driving.
Heart rate: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison at this time.  The high amplitude record and the posterior slow waves of youth are normal findings.
