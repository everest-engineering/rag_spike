CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old male, stroke with right hemiparesis, new onset seizure.  History of HIV, intracerebral hemorrhage and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal background.  It is slow, relatively low voltage, featureless with bursts of frontal beta and then slow delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces scant theta.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow, low voltage pattern.
Scant frontal delta.
Paucity of reactivity and variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings can be seen with the use of propofol.  They can also be seen in the context of severe toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
