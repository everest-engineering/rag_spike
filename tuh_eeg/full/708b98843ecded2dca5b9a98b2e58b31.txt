CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed woman who had 2 seizures on a bus trip in April 2012.  She recalls feeling hot and then hearing voices, but awoke 2 days later.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Tramadol, Risperdal, Ambien, Coumadin, Amitriptyline.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is almost an exclusively sleep EEG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the EEG includes stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, POSTs and occasional wicket noted on the left.  The patient is falling asleep in both hyperventilation and photic stimulation and in the brief wakefulness, the patient is still somewhat drowsy with theta.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG primarily in sleep due to:
Occasional, shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing is suggested.  In addition, testing for maximal wakefulness may also be of use in characterizing the background.
