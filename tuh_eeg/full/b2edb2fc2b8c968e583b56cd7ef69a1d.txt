History:	67 year old man who underwent cardiac ablation yesterday.  This am, following a
successful extubation, patient developed acute change in mental status in the
setting of severe HTN.  Stroke code was activated and patient received tPA.
Medications:	Propofol drip, versed drip and versed IVP
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage polymorphic delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Frequent low amplitude brief diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms are
noted.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute portable EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but at least partially is medication induced.  Patient was placed on continuous EEG
