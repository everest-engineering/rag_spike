CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old woman here for left CEA status post a left stroke in June 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, Vitamin B, Pepcid, Prinzide, Ativan
REASON FOR STUDY:  Preop for left carotid endarterectomy.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known history of a stroke in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
