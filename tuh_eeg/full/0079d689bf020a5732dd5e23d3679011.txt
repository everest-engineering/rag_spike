CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old male with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain for a day, past history of epilepsy, subdural hematoma, alcohol and drug abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed. This is an awake and drowsy record in a patient who seems to be uncomfortable and has periods with frequent eye blink.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. In brief portions of the record, rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity is identified in the left temporal region. Photic stimulation produces trivial driving response but also seems to accentuate the rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity in the left temporal region some of which is sharply contoured.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were seen, however the left temporal features described above can be seen in complex partial epilepsy. Previous records were not available for comparison.
