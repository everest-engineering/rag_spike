CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old left-handed gentleman with liver metastases, at induction to anesthesia was noted to have an episode of staring, unresponsiveness, followed by one minute generalized shaking without incontinence or tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background is diffusely slow and the patient is relatively somnolent with at best a theta frequency background. There are some bursts of shifting slowing noted in the background. Brief eye opening was noted and the patient was able to provide the year and the season as winter with more of a theta background and some shifting slowing a bit more on the right compared to the left.  Occasional FIRDA was noted.  Features of stage II sleep included vertex waves and spindles.
Photic stimulation was performed at the bedside.
Scant photic driving was noted.
Heart rate 128 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Overall, this EEG is most compatible with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  If epilepsy and seizures are an important consideration, a follow up tracing may be of value.
