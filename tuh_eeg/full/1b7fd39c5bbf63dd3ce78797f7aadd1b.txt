CLINICAL HISTORY:   82 year old right handed woman admitted on the 21st with episode of left arm shaking and weakness, slurred speech lasting 2-3 minutes.  Post event 20 minutes of slurred speech with right facial droop.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 7.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting delta noted in the background.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  There were no additional bursts of focal slowing. Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A subject of this age is permitted a rare burst of shifting delta as this patient demonstrated.  The alpha rhythm at 7.8 Hz, however, is below the
limits of normal for an adult of this age.  It is a nonspecific finding which could be seen in postictal state, dementia or many other pathologies.
