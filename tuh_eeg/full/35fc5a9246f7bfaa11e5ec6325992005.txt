CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with concussion, depression,
confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Neurontin, Seroquel

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the
record but there is an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm glimpsed on occasion. Other
features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and vertex activity. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. This is a drowsiness
record and if there is any question about an underlying encephalopathy, a followup
study with testing to make sure that the patient is maximally awake is suggested.
