CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old woman, seizure free for 1-2 years.  Characteristics of seizures included oral automatisms and tongue biting, positive family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, multivitamins, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a routine outpatient EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Impedances were acceptable aside from the T1 and T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness, rhythmic midtemporal theta activity was noted with 5 Hz activity seen infrequently, left more so than the right.  Stage 2 sleep was captured at the close of the recording with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  No temporal theta was noted at that time.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep, but produced vigorous bilateral driving response with supraharmonic driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through brief stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG for this subject which did not identify epileptiform activity.  The rhythmic midtemporal theta noted in drowsiness is a normal variant.
