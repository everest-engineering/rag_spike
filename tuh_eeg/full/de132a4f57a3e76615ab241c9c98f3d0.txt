CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old left handed female with a history of breast cancer, status post lumpectomy and chemotherapy and radiation, presents to the hospital because of being confused and disoriented for the past 7 days.
MEDICATIONS: Protonix, HCTZ, Lisinopril, Fosamax, Celebrex, Loratadine, Lovenox, ASA
REASON FOR STUDY:  Memory loss.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep at stage 1.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which revealed no abnormal discharges.  However, hyperventilation produced some accentuation of focal slowing which I will refer to in the next paragraph.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage 1.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T6/O2 and sometimes more anteriorly at T4.  This was slightly accentuated by hyperventilation and only seen occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Some right posterior temporal infrequent slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right posterotemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
