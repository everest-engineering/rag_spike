History:	53 year old woman status post prolonged cardiac arrest, now with myoclonic jerks
and posturing events.  Patient will be placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
Medications:	Propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  Voltages are diffusely attenuated.  The background consists
of very low amplitude fast activity.  Rhythmic ventilator artifact is present early in the recording.  No
normal sleep architecture is present.
At 10:39:46 am, ~6 second-long seizure is captured.  Electrographically, it is characterized by
sudden onset of generalized high amplitude fast activity that rapidly decreases in frequency to
rhythmic diffuse theta activity that rapidly stops.  Event occurs several seconds after initiation of
suctioning and is characterized by what appears to be extensor posturing.
There is continuous EKG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Other, no clear reactivity
Attenuation, severe
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Seizure, single generalized, ~6 seconds; associated with posturing
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 27-minute EEG due to severe diffuse slowing, attenuation, lack of
background reactivity and a single brief (~ 6seconds) generalized seizure (clinically associated with
posturing). These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  A single brief seizure indicates cortical excitability.  In the setting of anoxic brain
injury these findings indicate poor chance of full neurological recovery.  These findings were
