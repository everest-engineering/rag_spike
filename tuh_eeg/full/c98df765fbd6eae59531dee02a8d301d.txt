History:	36 year old woman with a history of reported seizures.
Medications:	Keppra and Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by moderate-to-high amplitude 10Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is captured.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is
present.  Occasional brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves
occur throughout the recording, increasing during hyperventilation.  Patient remains awake
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces diffuse high
amplitude slow delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), occasional
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 31 minute EEG due to occasional bursts of diffuse delta activity
that resembles FIRDA. This activity could be seen various encephalopathies, increased ICP,
bilateral deep white matter lesions.  Patient may also be excessively drowsy.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
