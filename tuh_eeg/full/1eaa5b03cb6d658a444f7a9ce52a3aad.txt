History:	45 YR OLD FEMALE WITH H/O SEIZURES. LAST SEIZURES LAST MONTH LOC,
TONGUE BITING NO INCONTINENCE. NOW WITH PANCREATITIS.
Medications:	Keppra, Tylenol 3
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T4 and T6  region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Single F8/T2 sharp wave is seen during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, single, right frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal, Mid and posterior temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of a single epileptiform discharge in the right
fronto-temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic area in that
region.  In addition there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right posterior temporal
and midtemporal region, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
