MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Keppra, phenytoin, valproate, Zoloft, metoprolol, and others.
INTRODUCTION: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 50-70 microvolts.  Posterior slow waves of youth are noted. Small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta was seen.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
During the course of the EEG, the patient had multiple 20-30 second episodes of generalized shaking and jiggling with head moving from side to side body thrusting and alternating motor activity. These episodes produced muscle artifact, but no epileptiform features.
