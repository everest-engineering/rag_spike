CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old male with previous right parietal lobe hemorrhage/ sagittal sinus thrombosis On Depakote for behavior. No reported history of seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Seroquel, Warfarin

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is diffusely slow, the primary frequencies on the left hemisphere include a mixture of 5 and 7 Hz activity, as well as a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more of a pattern of delta.  There is some sharply contoured delta in the right hemisphere, including C4, T4, and F8. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR:    68 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffuse slow background.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the right.
3. Sharply contoured slowing in the right central temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter.  In addition, there are focal features with some sharply contoured slowing, suggesting an irritative process.
