CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old male with acute hydrocephalus, left temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage in June, 2010, left craniectomy in 2010, followed by stroke. Patient was admitted January 6, 2011, with craniotomy defect, confusion, DVT, and stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lasix, Metoprolol, K-Dur
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. Despite a breach rhythm, there is a well-defined left anterior temporal sharp wave noted in wakefulness. Other features of this record include bursts of paroxysmal sharply-contoured slowing out of the left temporal region which occur without a clear clinical correlate. Because of the prominent eye-blink, attempt is made to reduce this. No clinical features are seen in association with the eye-blink artifact.
Following this, the patient becomes drowsy. There is an increase in background slowing. In drowsiness, the epileptiform activity demonstrates a more extensive field of thread, other anterior temporal or centroparietal in nature. No additional paroxysmal bursts of slowing are noted.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves identified from the left temporal region which may be anterior temporal, centroparietal, or posterior temporal.
2. Bursts of paroxysmal slowing in the left temporal region without clinical correlate.
3. Epileptiform activity in the left mid-to-anterior-temporal region as well as posterior temporal region.
4. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests a prominent, epileptogenic or epileptiform process on the left. No clinical seizures were recorded. Ongoing vigilance is appropriate.
