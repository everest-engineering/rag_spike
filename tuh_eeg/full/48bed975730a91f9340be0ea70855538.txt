CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed female with a history of spinal meningioma, high cholesterol, memory problems, and anxiety, presents for follow up of seizure disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Topamax
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 11 Hz, and it appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some excessive beta seen in the limited wave forms.  The majority of the recording is in drowsiness or sleep, and there is normal stage I and stage II activity seen.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta seen in the limited wakefulness at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive theta seen in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this is slightly different from the previous recordings that were done on 03/11/2009 which was Digitrace for 24 hours, as well as the one on 05/15/2008 which had reported normal EEGs.
