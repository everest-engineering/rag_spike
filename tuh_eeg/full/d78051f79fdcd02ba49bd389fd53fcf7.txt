CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old left handed woman, with episodes of falling and
incontinence occurring 3 time a week for the last 3 months. The patient may have a
feeling of nausea before the event.
MEDICATIONS: Detrol, Ativan, Benadryl, Cogentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized. There is a 9 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm identified. It is
initially subtly asymmetric. Hyperventilation is performed in the record and
hyperventilation elicits rhythmic left temporal slowing. As hyperventilation concludes the
patient is somewhat drowsy and again this rhythmic, left temporal4 Hz activity is
identified, which sometimes again disrupts the posterior dominant rhythm. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal 4 Hz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: While there are no epileptiform features observed in this
record, the rhythmic slowing described above is relatively characteristic of that seen in
epilepsy, although it is not specific and it can be seen in structural pathology in that
hemisphere. If additional information is needed, a follow up study capturing deeper
stages of sleep may be of use. Correlation with imaging is suggested.
