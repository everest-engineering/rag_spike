History:	35 year old female with a witnessed seizure at home.
Medications:
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  Throughout the record there are intermittent 1-2 second bursts of
generalized 6 Hz spike-and-wave activity.  These are more frequent during hyperventilation (see
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces frequent
generalized bursts of spike-and-wave discharges.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) induces no significant photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, intermittent generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG due to intermittent generalized spike-and-wave complexes. This
pattern may be seen in idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
