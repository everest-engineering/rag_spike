CLINICAL HISTORY:  37 year old left handed woman with epilepsy.  Previously seizure-free in 2009, now with seizures occurring every 1 to 2 months.  Headaches, hypertension, depression, anxiety, and mood swings.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lisinopril, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 3 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of alpha rhythm followed by posts.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is identical to the July 21, 2009, EEG.  Neither EEGs identified epileptiform activity.
