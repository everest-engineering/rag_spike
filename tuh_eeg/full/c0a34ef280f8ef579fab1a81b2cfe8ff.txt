History:	55 year old man who was found down.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
The background consists of polymorphic 10 Hz alpha posteriorly, expected but weak AP gradient,
excess polymorphic theta activity, underriding fast activity and frequent eye blinks/ lateral eye
movement bifrontal artifact.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~110 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 24 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that, in
this case, is at least partially medication induced.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
