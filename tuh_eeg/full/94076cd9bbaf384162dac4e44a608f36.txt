CLINICAL HISTORY:  Meningitis, encephalitis, evaluate for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, HCTZ.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a routine, technically satisfactory EEG capturing in wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with a 6 hertz posterior dominant rhythm.  Shifting slowing was noted with underlying arrhythmic delta activity noted from either hemisphere.  There is significant EKG artifact picked up in the temporal regions.  There are occasional bursts of sharply contoured slowing noted from either right or left hemisphere, which can be differentiated from EKG artifact.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and did not significantly activate the record.
MRI demonstrating extensive white matter pathology, demyelinating and/or ischemic.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing with at times sharply contoured slowing noted from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance involving gray and white matter, and may be correlated with imaging.
