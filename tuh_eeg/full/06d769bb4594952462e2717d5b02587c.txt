CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 15-day-old male infant born at 31 weeks' gestation to mother, who required treatment with methadone and Wellbutrin.  The patient had intermittent spasms, evaluate for infantile spasms.  Baby otherwise developing well and doing well on the day of study.
MEDICATIONS:  Caffeine.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the neonatal ICU using the neonatal montage.  This record captures wakefulness and sleep for this presumptive 33 weeks' gestation individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the infant is resting quietly.  The infant transitions in and out of active sleep, quiet sleep, and wakefulness.  The EEG demonstrates appropriate developmental milestones for a 33-week infant with prominent delta brushes.  There are portions of the record with brief attenuations seen typically in the order of 3 seconds, rarely in the order of 5 seconds.  There are occasional frontal sharp waves noted in the record.  As the child transitions in and out of sleep states, there are some bursts of frontal delta.
Heart rate:  156 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within the limits of normal for an infant of this gestational age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The appropriate developmental milestones have been achieved.  Delta brushes are a typical finding at this age.  An infant at this age is permitted some sharp waves.  The overall continuity and developmental milestones as well as symmetry are appropriate for age and no clinical seizures were recorded.  If this infant is thought to have frequent spells, an additional EEG recording may be obtained.
