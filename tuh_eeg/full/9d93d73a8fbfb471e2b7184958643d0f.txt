History:	69 Y/O FEMALE R HANDED. PT STATES SHE HAS TREMORS AND IS
DROPPING THINGS ALL THE TIME. PT. STATES SHE HAS HAD SZ. IN PAST
WITH H/A AND THEN TREMORS WITH LOC. 55 CM HEAD PMHX.HTN,DM.
Medications:	TOPAMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
66 bps  Technical difficulties: There was a frequent eye movement artifact throughout the majority
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.
