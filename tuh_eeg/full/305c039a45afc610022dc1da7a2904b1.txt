CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male with bipolar disease and episodic
mixed intermittent psychotic features.

MEDICATIONS: Cogentin, Haldol, Vistaril, Prozac, Zyprexa, Lithium, Elavil,
Risperidone.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with
rhythmic, primarily, theta frequency activity, much of which is approximately 6 Hz.
There is some underlying delta activity. Wicket is observed. Features of drowsiness
include a hypersynchronous pattern with anterior spread of alpha rhythm. The alpha
rhythm, which remains slow, averaging 6.5 to 7Hz becomes more rhythmic in
drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Underlying disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific. Given the patient's
medications this pattern may reflect medication impact, but correlation with physical
exam and imaging may be of value.
