CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed woman who has had epilepsy since
1982. Seizures are characterized by loss of consciousness. Past history of recurrent
stroke, TIAs with bilateral upper extremity weakness. The last seizure was one week
ago during sleep.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Keppra; Plavix
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This
appears to be a primarily drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are brief sections when the patient is
maximally awake and alpha rhythm reaches 9.3 Hz but through much of the record, the
patient appears to be a bit drowsy with a slower alpha rhythm ranging from 7.8 to 8.3.
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. There are rare bursts of shifting underlying
delta noted in drowsiness. Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small degree of shifting slowing in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A repeat study capturing both deeper stages of sleep and
wakefulness with testing for wakefulness is suggested. No epileptiform features were
seen. The occasional bursts of shifting slowing may be correlated with this patient's
history of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
