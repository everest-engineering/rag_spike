CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old right handed man with history of seizures has been seizure free for one year.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lisinopril, Simvastatin, Avodart, ASA.
REASON FOR EEG:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard electrode placement with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with 20-60 microvolts amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1.  Photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow wave seen at F7/T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and at 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude seen frequently.
At times, these discharges become monomorphic and rhythmic and are consistent with temporal intermittent rhythmic delta (TIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
left anterior temporal slow waves.
TIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The finding of TIRDA has a high correlation with an epileptogenic focus in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. Please note that this EEG has similar findings to the one performed on 07/25/2011.
