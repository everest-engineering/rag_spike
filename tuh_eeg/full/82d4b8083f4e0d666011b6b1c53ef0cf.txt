History:	65 year old man with extensive PMH, now presents after two generalized tonic
clonic convulsions.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, lethargic
Description:
With stimulation and arousals, the background consists of a mixture of low amplitude theta and
delta activity and low amplitude EMG artifact.  Patient is asleep throughout most of the recording.
Sleep is characterized by frequent diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms and occasional vertex
Occasional left anterior temporal- frontopolar low-to-moderate amplitude sharp waves with
aftergoing slow waves are noted.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over Fp1, F7, T1 and T3 leads.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left anterior, anterior temporal- frontopolar
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
occasional left anterior temporal- frontopolar epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative
of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Epileptiform
discharges are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in anterior temporal- frontopolar
