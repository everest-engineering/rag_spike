History:	52 YR FEMALE FOUND UNRESP 11/15. ON TX LIST TUH FOR LIVER. ETOH
CIRRHOSIS, CKD IV, TIPS 10/14, . HYPER- AMMONIA. ALSO NOW ON
CONTINUOUS DIALYSIS.  PT CONTINUES TO BE UNRESPONSIVE.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Infrequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal at F8 and
a large frontal field.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, scarce, right frontotemporal
Triphasic waves, continuous
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of infrequent epileptiform discharges in the right
frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region. In addition there is  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
