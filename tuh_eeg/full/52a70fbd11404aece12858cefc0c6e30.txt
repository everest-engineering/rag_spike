LENGTH OF RECORDING:  26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is 50-year-old man with a 24-year history of seizures.  Last seizure was approximately a month ago.  Note:  The patient smelled of alcohol.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, and sleep spindles are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background.
Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at medium to high flash rate/frequencies.  A persistent bradycardia with heart rate of few than 60 beats a minute is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
Bradycardia with heart rate few than 60 beats a minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 26-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Bradycardia with heart rate few than 60 beats a minute is noted on a single EKG lead.
