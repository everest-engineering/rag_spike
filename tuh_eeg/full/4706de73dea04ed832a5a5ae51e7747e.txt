CLINICAL HISTORY:  29-year-old male, transferred from Roxborough Hospital for recurrent episodes of shaking without loss of consciousness.  Past history of substance abuse, Xanax and heroin dependency, anxiety and depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, and others
INPATIENT ROOM NUMBER:  NSICU.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative and had frequent involuntary movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a posterior-dominant rhythm of 10 Hz, 30 microvolts with generous low voltage frontal-central beta and frequent movement artifact.  There is also a fair amount of eye movement artifact.
Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Routine bedside EEG remarkable for excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Movement artifact was present in this study for this restless patient.
