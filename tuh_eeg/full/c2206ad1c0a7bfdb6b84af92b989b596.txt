POST ICTAL KNOW SHE HAS LOST TIME CONFUSED.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  Rare fragment of a generalized frontally-maximal spikes is seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, rare generalized, Fragment
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of rare generalized epileptiform
discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic. In addition there is mild  diffuse background
slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
