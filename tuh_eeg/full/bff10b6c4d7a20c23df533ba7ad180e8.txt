History:	65 year old man with extensive PMH, now presents with 1 week of left sided
numbness/ paresthesia.
Medications:	zofran,heparin,cellcept,asa,lopressor,protonix,plavix,amlodipine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
PRD reaches maximally 9 Hz.  AP gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz
activity is present throughout the recording.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz
rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording (FIRDA).  Patient remains awake
throughout the recording.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left hemisphere, especially over
the left frontotemporal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Frequent blink artifact is captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric, especially frontotemporal
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and continuous
focal left hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left frontotemporal region. Diffuse
slowing indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion.  FIRDA is seen in
encephalopathy, increased ICP, bilateral deep white matter lesions.  No epileptiform discharges
are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
