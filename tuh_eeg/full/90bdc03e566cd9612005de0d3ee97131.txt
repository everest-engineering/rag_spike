Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  66 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild to moderate diffuse background
slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.
