History:	28 year old man with seizures.
Medications:	Metoprolol, Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
There is right to left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that is less
formed and polymorphic over the right.  There is no clear AP gradient.  During drowsiness, the
alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic semi rhythmic delta activity is present in the bifrontal regions, right>
left.  Excess fast activity is present over the left central region.  Excess polymorphic theta activity is
noted over the right.  Intermittent low amplitude right anterior temporal sharp waves are noted.
Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F8, T2 and T4 electrodes.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, moderate, bilateral (L>R) frontal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, mild-to-moderate
Sharp waves, intermittent, right temporal, anterior, Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F8, T2
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to continuous bifrontal (right>left)
focal slowing; mild-to-moderate right hemispheric slowing and intermittent right anterior temporal
epileptiform discharges. Continuous focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely
structural in etiology.  Intermittent right anterior temporal epileptiform discharges indicate a
potentially epileptogenic focal structural abnormality.
