CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male admitted November 15, 2011 with schizophrenia, epilepsy, altered mental status. Epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, burn injury, post traumatic epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing opens, the patient is quite drowsy. The overall pattern is a lower voltage delta pattern. Stimulation of the patient produces diffuse beta. The patient waxes in and out of a drowsy state sometimes with vertex waves. There are tiny discrete sharp waves noted at T3. Photic stimulation does not activate the record and after photic stimulation, the patient transitions into stage II sleep. Discrete right temporal sharp waves are noted at the end of the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A relatively slow background.
Excess beta.
Discrete left temporal sharp waves, rare right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is very similar to a previous study May 25, 2011. The patient seems to be drowsier in this study compared to previous studies. There is less of an asymmetry noted today.
