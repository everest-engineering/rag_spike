History:	74 YO FEMALE H/O SEIZURE  PMH:  ESRD ON HD, DEMENTIA, CKD, CHF, DM,
HTN, HEP-C, ANEMIA PT WITH CHANGE IN MS.  FOUND TO BE IN STATUS?
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. They occur at 2-3Hz
throughout the record.  However, compared to the previous record now they are less well formed
and do not occur continuously  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 104
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, frequent, moderate
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
