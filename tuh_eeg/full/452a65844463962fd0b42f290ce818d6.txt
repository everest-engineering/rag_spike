History:	34 YR FEMALE WITH H/O EVENTS. BLINKING/ EYE MM AND FACIAL MM.
GRUNTS AND TALKS CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING..  PMHX; FIBROMYALGIA,
PITUITARY TUMOR (PROLACTIN PRODUCER), CHIARI MALFORMATION
Medications:	LAMICTAL, WELLBUTRIN, ZOLOFT, TRAMADOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 108  During almost the entire
record the patient exhibits facial movement, grunting , head back and fort irregular movements.
She had her yes closed for a large portion of the event. She had preserved memory during the
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only. The event described above had no EEG correlate, which is
most consistent with a non-epileptic event, likely psychogenic in nature.  Excessive beta activity
could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
