CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with family history of epilepsy in both maternal and paternal grandfathers.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Remeron, Zoloft, Doxycycline, Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Posterior predominant rhythmic delta is noted, right more so than the left.  Hyperventilation accentuates this phenomenon.  In addition, in hyperventilation, occasional T5 sharp waves are seen in pairs.  Hyperventilation also appears to accentuate a left occipital spike.  Both drowsiness and the post hyperventilation section of the record seems to accentuate underlying focal slowing, which is primarily right occipital today. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the background.  There is one section of the record with likely central mu identified bilaterally.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bioccipital slowing, complicated by some head rocking artifact, but sometimes more prominent on the right in comparison to the left.
Left occipital temporal sharp waves in spikes noted in hyperventilation and early in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings have been previously identified in prior records.  Some features that were seen in previous records were not seen today, including generalized spike and wave activity.  This patient's EEG pattern maybe a reflection of the factors which have contributed to his seizures, as well as genetic traits.
