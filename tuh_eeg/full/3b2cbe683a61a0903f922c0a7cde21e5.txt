History:	38 year old woman with a history of stroke at 1 year of age and seizures.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a moderate amplitude 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is noted over the right temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR is 85 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake- 20-minute EEG due to mild occasional right temporal slowing. This
finding is indicative of mild focal cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
