CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old male in status post PEA code for 30 minutes at an
unknown time or date.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Fentanyl, Aspirin, Lipitor
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage,
relatively stiff chest pattern with muscle artifacts. There is no variability in the record. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.

HR: 130 bpm

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively suppressed background.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The clinical significance of this pattern is unclear in that
the date of the code is not known and it is not known whether or not the dosage of
Ativan and fentanyl could contribute to the pattern described above. Clinical correlation
is suggested.
