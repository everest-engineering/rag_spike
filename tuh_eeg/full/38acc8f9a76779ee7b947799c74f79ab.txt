CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right handed female with an episode in November 2009 when the patient went to sleep and was unable to be awakened for a month. The patient was told that she had a seizure at that time.

MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab uÂ·sing standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is remarkable for a generous quantity of background of beta. There is a well-defined alpha rhythm of 8. 7 Hz. Head rocking artifact is noted In the background. Hyperventilation produces hypersynchronous theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG was within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity. There is a fair amount of head rocking artifact in the right posterior quadrant, but this does not otherwise preclude the interpretation of this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged sleep study may be considered.
