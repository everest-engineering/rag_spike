LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 44-year-old woman who presents with an episode of tonic clonic convulsion characterized by first head turning to the left, eyes rolling back and convulsing.
Past medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, pancreatitis and substance abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, Keppra, Topamax, Cipro, Serax.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The procedure done reaches approximately 8 to 8.5 Hz.  Alpha activity:  The anterior to posterior frequency gradient is present, but weak.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present.  Abundant frequent bursts of moderate to high amplitude diffuse frontal with predominant rhythmic delta (FIRDA) are captured.  Frequent theta bursts increases during drowsiness.  No clear normal sleep architecture is present; however, quiescence is captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation resulted in symmetrical signal driving.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
FIRDA abundant.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to mild diffuse slowing (FIRDA).  These findings indicate etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.  FIRDA could be seen in encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and bilateral deep white matter lesions. The lack of epileptiform discharges on routine EEG does not preclude clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
