DATES OF THE RECORDING:  01/29/2013 from about 8 a.m. until 01/30/2013 until about 8 a.m.  Total length of the recording approximately 24 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with a history of reported seizures since March  2011 characterized by a metallic taste in her mouth followed by loss of consciousness and convulsions.
NOTE:  The patient was sleep deprived until approximately 2 a.m. on 01/30/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Depakote 500 mg in the morning and 250 mg in the evening, clonazepam 2 mg b.i.d. as well as 2 mg p.r.n. q.12 hours.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Seizure detection and spike detection were activated.  The EEG recording was reviewed at least once in 24 hour period.  Medical staff notes and nursing notes were reviewed.  The patient was equipped with a push button.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess diffuse beta is captured.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, slow wave sleep, and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  There were no clear epileptiform discharges and no clear focal slowing.  There were no push button events.  Continuous EKG artifact is captured.
FINDINGS:
No events.
Normal awake and asleep study.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal 24-hour continuous audio video EEG monitoring.  No typical events were captured.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effects such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Of note, the patient was sleep deprived until  approximately 2 a.m. on 01/30/2013.
