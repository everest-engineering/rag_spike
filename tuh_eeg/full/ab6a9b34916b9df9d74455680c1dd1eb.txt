History: 34 year old female presents with h/o migraine and 2 episodes of confusion.
Medications: Tegretol Benadryl
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG, electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 8.5-9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient but it is weak. Additional diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present Frequent brief (2Â·5 second) bursts of 1 00-200uV, 24Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness. During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves. Sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing. Polymorphic, mild
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to mild slowing and intrusion of sleep into drowsiness. These findings are ethnologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction and may be related to excessively drowsy patient. FIRDA is observed with encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and deep white matter lesions. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. These findings were conveyed to the neurology primary team.
