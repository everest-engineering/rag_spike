CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old individual, status post code September 7, now comatose but over breathing the vent.  Renal failure, diabetes, hypertension.  The patient has a temperature of 99.3.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, hydralazine, nitroglycerine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient has recently treated with propofol drip, which had been discontinued.  Impedances were acceptable.  The patient was examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage and featureless.  Occasional eye movements are noted.  The overall pattern is one of low voltage and scant delta and theta.
Auditory stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Heart rate 114 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage, relatively featureless and slow pattern.
A relatively unreactive pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In this individual who is no longer receiving sedative hypnotic medications, the findings described above are worrisome.  Ongoing clinical evaluation is suggested.
