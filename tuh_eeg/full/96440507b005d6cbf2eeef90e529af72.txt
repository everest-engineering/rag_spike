History:	43 YR OLD MALE WITH H/O S/P RIGHT BASAL GANGLIA HEMORRHAGE WITH
LEFT SIDED DEFICITS, PT NEVER HAD SZ, EEG TO EVAL WOULD LIKE TO DC
KEPPRA
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which is best seen over the
left hemisphere and attenuates with eye opening.  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over left frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal anterior-temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is loss of faster frequencies over
that region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, maximal anterior-temporal and loss of
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
hemisphere maximal anterior-temporal region with associated loss of faster frequencies.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region involving gray matter..
