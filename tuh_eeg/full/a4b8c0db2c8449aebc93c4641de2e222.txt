History: 40 yo female with new onset seizures (2 episodes - 3/23/14 and 5/12/14). Patient not on AED but was prescribed Librium for Etoh withdrawal.
Medications:	Librium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation: This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
