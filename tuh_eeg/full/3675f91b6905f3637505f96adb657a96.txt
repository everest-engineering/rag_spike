CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old male with long ICU history after CABG, V-fib cardiac arrest.  Repeat EEG requested for agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, atorvastatin, and digoxin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening a brief alerting.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep states with frontal delta and some spindle.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to: Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no specific hallmarks of metabolic encephalopathy.  This EEG is most compatible with a nonspecific, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  This EEG is similar to a previous study May 7th, but there is a little bit more faster frequency activity noted today.
