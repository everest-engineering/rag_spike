CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed female with epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizures for which she is amnestic.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. This is a relatively low voltage EEG. Hyperventilation increases the amplitude of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and a small amount of beta and theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION. There were no focal nor epileptiform features observed in this record. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained. A followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep and with more prolonged recording in a transverse montage is suggested.
