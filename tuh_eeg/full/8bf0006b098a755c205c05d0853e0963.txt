CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed female with epilepsy characterized by
loss of awareness lasting 5 to 10 second. Last seizure on 9/22/2010.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra. Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Central Mu rhythm is
identified. Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude of the background.
HR: 70 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important
consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
