CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old female with complex partial epilepsy, seizure-free for many years.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Diovan, Starlix, Lipitor, Bystolic, Byetta
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Throughout much of the record, the patient is in stage I or stage II sleep with vertex waves, POSTS or a pattern of beta with theta. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not significantly activate the record. In hyperventilation, there is a suggestion of a left temporal sharp wave and there are a pair of sharp waves in the right temporal region in drowsiness although those have more of the morphology of the a normal variant.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG abnormal due to:
1. Left temporal sharp waves with a question of a pair of temporal sharp waves on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be compared to the patient's previous EEGs from some years ago. They are in agreement with a past history of partial complex epilepsy although epileptiform activity was quite subtle in this record.
