DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
This is a disorganized record with an alpha rhythm that ranges from 7.8 to 9.7. There is prominent shifting arrhythmic delta. The background is sharply contoured. There is mu occasionally seen in the central region of about 8 Hz. There are also wickets seen, which also makes the record look sharply contoured. Stage 1 and 2 sleep were seen in the recording with some sleep spindles. Photic stimulation shows some driving. No definite spikes or sharp waves seen.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal due to
1. Disorganized background
