AGE: 22 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/29/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1872
HISTORY:
22 y.o. male with a history of localization related epilepsy referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. 1 at bed for 2 weeks, then 1 BID; min target dose 200 mg clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 2 mg disintegrating tablet, Use as needed for any sz longer than 5 minutes
Levetiracetam 750 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr, Take 2,250 mg by mouth nightly. 3 tabs po hs
divalproex (DEPAKOTE) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth.
4 taps po qd SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a
mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity; organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing with bursts of sharply contoured theta and delta are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 102, but reaching as high as 130, bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
Heart rate up to the 130s is noted on a single EKG lead.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
Heart rate up to the 130s is noted on a single EKG lead.
