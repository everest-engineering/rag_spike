History:	65 YR MALE WITH ACUTE RIGHT FRONTO/PARIETAL HEMOR.  S/P RIGHT ECA
EMBOLIZATION AND STENT AT OSH. PT NOT RESPONDING AND LEFT SIDE
WEAKNESS.
Medications:	MORPHINE AND LORAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the frontal
region. There is an additional loss of faster frequencies over this region.  Periodic lateralized
epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the F4 region at a rate of 1Hz.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 108
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, Maximal frontal
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  Continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs) in the right frontal region.  These findings are indicative of a highly potentially
epileptogenic acute focal cortical destructive lesion in the region.  No electrographic seizures are
