CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old male with delirium following endoscopy and gallbladder biopsy 2 weeks ago.  Patient demonstrates psychomotor slowing.  MRI demonstrates acute right cerebellar and left MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, ASA, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside on the floor using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a diffusely pattern with a mixture of theta-delta.  When the patient is unstimulated, there is a theta and alpha frequency pattern.  The patient is quite restless and much of the EEG includes some muscle artifact.  There is a bit of sharply contoured slowing in the right central temporal region in relaxed wakefulness.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  There was a bit of sharply contoured slowing which may be correlated with imaging.  No subclinical seizures were identified.
