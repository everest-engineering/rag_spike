CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed woman with left MCA stroke, baseline
right sided weakness, and expressive aphasia with acute change in mental status and
eye deviation to the right.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Zocor, Metoprolol, Zosyn, Vancomycin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is lying flat and has
very little spontaneous movement. but she is awake. She is restless only in the later
sections of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in much of the relaxed
wakeful record is slow bilaterally. There is a discernible, slow alpha rhythm of 7 Hz with
some smaller 6 Hz activity. What is striking, particularly in relaxed wakefulness is the
record is actually slower on the right than the left with disruption of faster frequency in
the right hemisphere, particularly in the right posterior region. Features of sleep include
vertex waves. In the transition to sleep, there are some bursts of FIRDA
HR: 96 bpm irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
3. Bursts of FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings should be correlated with imaging. No
epileptiform features were noted in this record. Because of the history provided above,
concern about an underlying, new structural process are appropriate.
