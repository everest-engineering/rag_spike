CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, a seizure this
past summer, an aura-like event in recent weeks, exacerbated by playing a video game.
Dilantin, Primidone, Centrum
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm
which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of low voltage
frontocentral beta activity. The major findings in this record include bursts of frontally
predominant 3 to 5Hz spike in wave activity which is generalized, frontally predominant
and symmetric. It is seen in relaxed wakefulness and is accentuated by
hyperventilation and drowsiness. The bursts of activity never last longer than 3 seconds
and in hyperventilation they increase in frequency. Photic stimulation results in a driving
response with paroxysmal SPECT and wave activity noted only at 17 Hz.
HR: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Relatively classic appearance of frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz SPECT wave
activity seen in wakefulness, hyperventilation, and ear1y drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most supportive of an inherited mechanism
for epilepsy.
