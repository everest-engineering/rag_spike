History:	63 year old man with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Zocor, Propranolol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta is present throughout the recording.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Excessive beta activity could
be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
