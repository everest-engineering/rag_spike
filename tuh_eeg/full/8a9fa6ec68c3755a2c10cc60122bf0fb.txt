CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed female with a history of seizures since age 16, episodes described as heightening awareness, sounds seem louder and frightening with palpitations.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation which caused a nice diffuse high-amplitude slowing response and photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional T4 slowing at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.
Although no abnormal frequent posterior slow waves were seen, at times almost suggestive of an occipital slowing, but not clearly so.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
