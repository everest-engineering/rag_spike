CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old right handed woman with a slip and fall episode with possible seizure. The patient was treated briefly with Tegretol.
MEDICATIONS:  Folate Acid, Timolol, Lisinopril, Prednisone, Dorzolamide
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there are 9 Hz alpha rhythm. As the patient transitions to sleep there is some focal slowing in the right central temple region.
Wicket activity is identified. Hyperventilation demonstrates shifting slowing with more theta on the left and a bit more arrhythmic activity on the right. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. There are wicket sharp waves, which are considered a normal finding, identified on the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting slowing but with a predominance on the right, outside of the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  If not previously done, a study with stage 2 sleep would be helpful to make sure there is no underlying epileptiform activity.
