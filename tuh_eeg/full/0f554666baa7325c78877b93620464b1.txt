CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old woman with dementia, seen in the emergency room
11 days ago for tonic-clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Aricept.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and attempted
photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG includes a slow
and disorganized pattern with an alpha rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hydrochlorothiazide. There is
shifting arrhythmic delta activity and shifting asymmetries. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow background
2. Disorganized background.
CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were observed. This
EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
