,STROKE R SIDE,A FIB,DEPRESSION.
Medications:	PRINIVIL,COUMADIN,CYMBALTA,INSULIN,LASIX,LOPRESSOR,TRAZODONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry with an almost continuous
attenuation of faster frequencies seen mainly over the right temporal region.  No epileptiform
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr is 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent temporal, mid
Attenuation, continuous, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal; region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  In addition the attenuation seen over the right midtemporal region is consistent with
the known infarct in that region.
