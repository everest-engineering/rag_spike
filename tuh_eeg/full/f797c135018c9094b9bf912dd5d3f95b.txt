CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, phenobarbital, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient continues to have focal jerking of the arm and face while awake.  She also demonstrates aphasia.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness and sleep the patient demonstrates periodic delta from the left hemisphere, particularly central temporal and posterior regions.  During some sections of the record, particularly in sleep, left occipital sharp waves and spikes are noted.  These sometimes wax and wane, but do not clearly evolve.
The discharges are slightly less prominent on the morning of October 9, 2012.  The activity from the right hemisphere remains slow.
The epileptiform activity persists through stage II sleep.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  None because we are not done with it yet.
