CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed woman with a history of stroke, head trauma,  and left-sided shaking for 1.5 years. The patient now has daily episodes of left-sided shaking. Past history of left arm and left leg cramping and MRI with both prior stroke and trauma.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Gabapentin, Metformin, Glyburide, Lisinopril, Hydralazine,  Zocor, Protonix, Naprosyn
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is subtle focal slowing n9ted in the record with disrupt ion of faster frequency in the right temporal and centrotemporal region. AI times this is somewhat rhythmic and at other times it is somewhat sharply contoured at T 4 and C4. As the patient becomes drowsy, the focal slowing and disruption of faster frequency activity is somewhat more prominent. In some sections of the record there is a slight accentuation of amplitude and beta, suggesting a possible breach rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Poor harmonic driving is noted .
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing characterized by intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity in the right centrotemporal region and the presence of slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed in this record. In comparison to a previous EEG o f January 8, 2010, the focal slowing is a little bit more prominent in this record. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged EEG, capturing one of her spells is suggested.
