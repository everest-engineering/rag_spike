History:	62 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O BREAKTHROUGH SZ X 3 ON 3/23/14
SEEN AT OSH, SZ W/LOC, RT ARM SHAKING AND NO RECALL OF EVENT,
RETURN TO BASELINE APPROX 1 HR. PT STATES SHE'S HAD SZ SINCE BIRTH.
Medications:	DILANTIN, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
There is continuous focal slowing in left hemisphere, maximal in the central region with an
associated increase in voltage and prominence of faster frequencies consistent with a breach
rhythm.  At times, the focal slowing is sharply contoured but not clearly epileptiform.  No
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, Maximal centrally, with
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to continuous focal slowing over the left
hemisphere maximal in the central region with an associated increase in amplitude as well as
faster frequencies , which is consistent with a focal structural lesion in that region and a possible
skull defect.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
