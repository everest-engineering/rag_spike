CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old right handed male with subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hepatitis C, hepatic cirrhosis, HIV, BPH, diabetes and balanitis.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Glipizide, Aldactone, Ciprofloxacin, Glipizide, MVI, Folate Acid, Flomax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an individual who is a bit restless. When he is awake, there is intermittently a low voltage, 8.3 to 8. 7 Hz alpha rhythm. He is restless and then drifts off into sleep followed by arousals. Intermittent rhythmic theta is identified in wakefulness.
HR: 78 bpm occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is quite modest, particularly given the clinical history described above. The patient's behavior during the EEG is a little unusual and may be reflective of his acute brain injury or underlying CNS and psychiatric pathology.
