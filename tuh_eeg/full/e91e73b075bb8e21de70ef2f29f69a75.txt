Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Intermittent brief bursts of frontally-maximal spike-and-wave discharges
and polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of 4-5 Hz. This
discharges have an asymmetric onset and appear to commence on the right.  At times there are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent frontally predominant
spike-and-wave and polyspike-and-wave discharges, that appear to have a right frontal onset and
are potentially epileptogenic.  The asymmetry may suggest a primary focal epilepsy with rapid
bilateral secondary spread.  Please note that this asymmetry has been noted in the past however
the bursts in previous records appear to have been  more symmetric and mostly consistent with a
generalized epilepsy.  Please evaluate clinically.
