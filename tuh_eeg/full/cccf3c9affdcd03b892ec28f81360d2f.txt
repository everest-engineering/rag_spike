CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old right handed male with a history of hydrocephalus, shunt, refractory epilepsy, and persistent readmission with breakthrough seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Haldol, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There are some sections of the record when the patient is nicely awake and the EEG is reasonably well organized with a low-voltage alpha rhythm and a more of an alpha and theta frequency pattern.  Despite the breach, there is some focal slowing in the right frontocentral region, and there are sharp waves noted at F4 and C4.  In addition, there are also sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including F7 and T1, more compatible with anterior temporal sharp waves, and then the right frontal more than left frontal spikes.  Features of drowsiness include vertex waves.  At times, the right frontal sharp waves or spikes are a bit more prominent.  Photic stimulation is not particularly successful as the patient starts moving around.  There is a brief driving response.
HR:    102 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background.
Sharp waves from the right frontocentral region.
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These features have been previously identified for this individual.  This may be his fifth EEG to date.  If there are any additional questions about localization of his epilepsy, EEG monitoring may be considered.
