History:	44 year old man with recent change in behavior and staring spells, concerning for
seizures.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~18 hours from 11/11/2014 to 11/12/2014.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the EEG in real
time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Several epochs of REM sleep are captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL ~18 hours continuous video EEG monitoring.  No typical events were captured.
