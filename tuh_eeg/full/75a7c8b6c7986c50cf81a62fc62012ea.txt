CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man who fell down on 1/22/2013.  The patient remained fully responsive.  EEG is performed to rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, Lopressor, SaliCept, prednisone and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG and additional T1 and T2 electrodes. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude to gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude alpha theta and delta activity.  Delta activity appears to be more prominent frontally.  Additionally, frontally predominant delta activity (FIRDA) is observed in brief runs.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 23-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No electrographic seizures were captured.  FIRDA could be seen in encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and deep white matter lesions.
