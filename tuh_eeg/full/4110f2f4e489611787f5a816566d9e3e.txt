CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed male, with 2 episodes of during sleep when he moved things around his room, bit his tongue, snored, followed by sore muscles.
MEDICATIONS: HCTZ, Omeprazole, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat low voltage. There is a well defined alpha rhythm of 11 Hz. There is generous, low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background. The overall background includes generous beta and some 12 Hz activity. As the patient becomes sleepier there is slow rolling eye movements, some artifacts in the right temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at faster flash frequencies.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generous beta and the low voltage pattern are normal findings. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study, capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
