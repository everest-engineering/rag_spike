CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 58-year-old woman with questionable seizure characterized by right arm twitching and incontinence.  Right cerebellar infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  ASA,Dig,Lactulose, Rifaximin, Meclizine
INTRODUCTION:  Twenty-minute digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This EEG was performed in the lab.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat disorganized with excess background theta and an alpha rhythm, which includes 2 frequencies, some 8 Hz activity and some 6 Hz activity.  The alpha rhythm is somewhat better defined on the right compared to the left.  The overall background is high amplitude, sharply contoured with bursts of shifting, slowing.  In this sharply contoured record, with an irregular heart rate and EKG artifact, there are still some sharp waves identified including left mid temporal and questionably some as well in the right.  Those on the right include a phase reversal at T2.
The EEG waxes and wanes, in some sections of the record demonstrate a bit better organized pattern with a better defined alpha rhythm, particularly during photic stimulation.
Photic stimulation does not otherwise seem to particularly elicit a driving response.
Heart rate irregular, 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG was remarkable for:
Markedly disorganized and sharply contoured background.
Sharp waves noted, particularly in the left hemisphere, but also in the right.
Subtle focal features, somewhat slower on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slowing and disorganization support a diffuse CNS process such as a toxic metabolic process. The focal and epileptiform features should be correlated with imaging and history. These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
