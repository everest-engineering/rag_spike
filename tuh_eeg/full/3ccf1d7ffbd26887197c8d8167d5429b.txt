CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old woman with a left brain abscess, ventriculostomy, complicated neurosurgical history included recurrent concussions, subsequent development of epilepsy with 1-2 seizures per month. The seizures characterized by an aura of bad taste and smell, migraine headache and bipolar disease.
MEDICATIONS: Trazodone, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm identified. In addition, Mu rhythm is identified but testing is not performed to confirm this. There is a small amount of shifting slowing in the background. A breech rhythm is identified with higher amplitude activity particularly in the left central region. Hyperventilation produces bursts of delta with shifting slowing with the delta. Some of the bursts are relatively sustained with more sustained delta on the left or right. As the patient became drowsy the alpha drops out earlier on the right compared to the left. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. There are sections of the record, particularly at the close of the record, where the alpha rhythm reaches 10 Hertz on the right compared to the left.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm in wakefulness.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Breech rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The prominent features with independent slowing seen from the right or left particularly with more of a hyperventilation response with slowing on the right compared to the left suggesting by hemispheric process. No epileptiform features were seen, but if further characterization of this individual's epilepsy is important, a more prolonged study with sleep or additional recording mechanisms may be sought.
