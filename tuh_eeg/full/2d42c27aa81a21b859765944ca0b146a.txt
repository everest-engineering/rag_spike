CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman at 16 weeks of pregnancy.  The patient has "more feelings like she is having a seizure without feeling that she is actually having a full seizure."
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Technical limitations of the EEG included some problems with impedance.  The patient had matted hair.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slowing of the background rhythm with POSTS.
Brief stage II sleep included vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically limited, but normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen for this individual with a past history of seizures, it may be valuable to find previous studies.  If a repeat study is needed, consideration for a repeat study with clean hair would improve the technical quality of the record.
