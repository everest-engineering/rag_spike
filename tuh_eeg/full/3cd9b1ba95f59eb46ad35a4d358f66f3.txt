History:	55 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O HICCUPS FOR 5-6 DAYS ALL DAY, BUT
GOES  AWAY WHEN IN SLEEP. ALSO C/C OF CHEST PAIN.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 6 Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Heart rate 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the left mid temporal region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In
addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing and slowing of the alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
