C/C OF R SIDED WEAKNESS DIFFICULTY MOVING AROUND. SEIZURES IN PAST.
Medications:	Dilantin, neurontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  At
times with stimulation the background improves to theta activity with some intermixed diffuse beta.
Diffuse excess beta activity  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal frontally best
noted during stimulation.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Hr was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 hour EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere
maximal in the frontal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region,
which is consistent with the known tumor. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
