CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old woman with right CVA and a history of seizures, frequent falling.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Simvastatin,  ASA, Neurontin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an intrahemispheric asymmetry characterized by disruption of alpha on the right in comparison to the left with rhythmic delta.  From the left, the background is well organized with a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and central mu activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing on the right and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm on the left. Photic stimulation elicits driving best represented on the left.
HR:	90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere.
2.	Disruption of faster frequency on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter.  No epileptiform features were noted.
