CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old male with new-onset seizures, renal failure and
abnormal tox screen.
MEDICATIONS: None listed in chart.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized with a slow alpha rhythm of 7.6 Hz. Occasional FIRDA is observed.
Occasional shifting slowing is noted. Photic stimulation does not activate the record,
but FIRDA is seen at that time. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the
record.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. FIRDA {frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity).
2. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
3. Occasional shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a
diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes, but they are
typical of those seen in renal failure. No epileptiform features were noted.
