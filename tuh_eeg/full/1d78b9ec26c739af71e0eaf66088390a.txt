SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is markedly abnormal.	There is a clear asymmetry.	The right hemispheric demonstrates a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and what seems to be an alpha subharmonic of 5 Hz.	The pattern from the right hemisphere is low-voltage and there is underlying low-voltage beta and theta.	The left hemisphere demonstrates significant attenuation of faster frequency activity and is a lower voltage theta delta pattern.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	The asymmetry noted previously as not quite as marked but is still prominent.	Most notably, there is far less beta noted on the left
Sleep is not sustained
Generalized slowing is present. Focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: Elicited unilateral driving on the right
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is abnormal routine EEG.
#1 Marked slowing from the left hemisphere
#2 unilateral driving
#3 mild slowing noted on the right
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left.
In addition, the bihemispheric slowing supports a bilateral process.	No epileptiform features were identified . These findings should be correlated with imaging
