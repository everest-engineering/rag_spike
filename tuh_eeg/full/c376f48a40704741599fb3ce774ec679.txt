CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old woman with a history of a ruptured aneurysm, subdural hematoma and stroke in 1982, followed by the development of epilepsy.  Her last seizure was a year ago characterized by a strange smell, then tonic-clonic activity with loss of consciousness and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Naprosyn
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is noted to have a craniotomy on the right. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the overall EEG is reasonably low voltage with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  A breach rhythm is noted in the right central region with accentuation of beta in that region.  There is also some focal delta at C4.  Both hyperventilation and drowsy accentuates the focal delta, as well as the breach rhythm with focal beta.  Features of drowsiness included the focal features described above and attenuation of the alpha with generous beta.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
:HR:     64 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right central region.
No sharp waves but some sharply contoured slowing in the same region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right.  If additional information is needed, a followup study capturing the first stages of sleep is suggested.
