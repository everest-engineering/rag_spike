CLINICAL HISTORY:
41-year-old male with a history of seizures. Has been seizure free for of many years now.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
This is an awake and drowsy record. In wakefulness, there is a 9-10Hz alpha bilaterally. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and slowing of the record . Hyperventilation causes an increase in amplitude, some shifting slowing and hypersynchronous theta activity. Photic stimulation brought about some driving. At the end of the record, there was a burst of irregular delta that lasted for 7 seconds followed by 5 Hz theta, which also contained two sharp waves originating from the left temporal T3.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to
1. Left temporal sharp waves at T 3.
2. Burst of irregular delta followed by theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Above findings are not uncommon in complex partial epilepsy.
