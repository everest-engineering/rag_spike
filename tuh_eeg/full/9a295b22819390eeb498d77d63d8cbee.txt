RECORDING LENGTH:  Almost 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a seizures characterized by loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  The patient has been seizure free since 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed in the laboratory.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10-10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Fast alpha variant is occasionally observed.  Additionally, the patient has frequent eye fluttering throughout the recording.
During brief drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in mild  diffuse background slowing.
Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Blinking artifact.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  Frequent blinking artifact is captured throughout the recording.  This could limit interpretation of the activity over the right frontal regions.
