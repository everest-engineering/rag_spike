CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old male with epilepsy, seizure free for the past 7 months.  Tonic-clonic seizures with postictal confusion, family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  none
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well organized, a 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Drowsiness was characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements, vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, although the patient is drifting off sleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in the record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study may be of value.
