CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old female with intracerebral hemorrhage, admitted on April 12, 2011. Multiple neurologic problems, including sickle cell disease, cocaine abuse, left frontal lobe infarcts, and intraventricular hemorrhage with obstructive hydrocephalus, and bipolar
disease.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Gentamicin, Hydralazine, Folic Acid, Metronidazole, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an abnormal background with an interhemispheric asymmetry. Arrhythmic delta activity is noted from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity, the suggestion of a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity, and some frontal beta. The right hemisphere demonstrates a lower amplitude mixed alpha, theta, and delta pattern. Stimulation of the patient does seem to increase faster frequency activity. There are some sharply contoured discharges in the left frontal temporal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background delta bilaterally.
HR: 70-120 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Sharply contoured slowing and a handful of sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were noted. Evaluation for the patient's tachycardia may be appropriate. The focal features described above are congruent with the neuro critical care history reported. The rapid heart rate may have been elicited by tactile stimulation.
