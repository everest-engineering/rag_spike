DATE OF STUDY:  October 5, 2014 through October 6, 2014.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post cardiac arrest on September 28th, persistent coma.
MEDICATIONS:  Cefepime, Depakote, Keppra, gentamicin, hydrocortisone, linezolid, micafungin, vancomycin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient remained intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This section of the record is remarkable for a burst suppression pattern.  The overall pattern is low voltage, relatively featureless.  It starts out with a bit more lower voltage theta.  As the recording continues, the overall pattern wanes and periods of suppression are a bit more prolonged.  Periods with cerebral activity demonstrate low voltage theta.
No additional doses of vecuronium were given as the recording continued on the 5th into the 6th.  On the morning of the 6th, the EEG remained very low voltage, slow with some artifacts, but with a low voltage, slow theta pattern.  The final sections of the record on the 6th include a very low voltage relatively continuous theta pattern.  Testing was not performed to assess reactivity or variability.
Heart rate 116 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring during this long-term EEG monitoring session for an individual anoxic encephalopathy was remarkable for:
Postanoxic myoclonus pattern is identified on the previous sections of this record.
Transition to a low voltage, very suppressed pattern.
A final pattern with very low voltage theta by the morning of the 6th.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates numerous worrisome patterns including relatively in variant pattern as well as a prolonged period with a burst suppression pattern.  These findings should be correlated with clinical exam and other neurodiagnostic findings.
