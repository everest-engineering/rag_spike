CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old woman with migraine headaches, currently continuous headaches 3 to 4 times a day and 2 confusional spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  This is a routine 20 minute EEG, it is technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is at best when the EEG is well-organized an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm which is disrupted by bursts of paroxysmal frontal theta.  This activity may be regular or irregular.  The overall background is sharply contoured and there is some notched frontal paroxysmal delta.
Hyperventilation produces bursts of frontal slowing, although similar bursts were seen in the routine background.
Photic stimulation was performed at a time when the EEG is a bit better organized, but there are some lower voltage bursts of theta, which do not appear to have been triggered by the photic stimulation.  At times the record is sharply contoured, but there is no definitive epileptiform activity
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Paroxysmal bursts of frontal slowing some of which are notched, but without definitive epileptiform activity.
Bursts of somewhat asynchronous irregular slowing without definitive epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  Ongoing evaluation as to the nature of this problem is suggested.
