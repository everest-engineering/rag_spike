History:	32 YR OLD FEMALE. TAKEN FROM OSH FOR HEART FAILURE S/P
AORTIC ROOT REPLACEMENT 58 CM HEAD. PT HAD CT SCAN SHOWED
Medications:	VASOPRESSIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 108  Continuous eye movement artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing, attenuation and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
