CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old woman with seizures since June 2010 with 3 seizures in life and a history of depression and borderline personality.
MEDICATIONS:  Imodium, Effexor, Clonazepam, Levetiracetam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T3 infrequently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There are 2 sharply contoured theta transient waveforms also at T3, but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
