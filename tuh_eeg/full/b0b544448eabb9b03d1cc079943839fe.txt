History:	84 YR FEMALE FOUND IN 2005 TO HAVE ??? LESION IN BRAIN WITH ONSET
OF SZS.  PT ONLY HAS SZS WHEN SHE DOESN'T TAKE HER MEDS. GTC/ NO
AWARE/FALL, WITH POST CONFUSION X 1 DY.
Medications:	Dilantin, Meloxicam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 78 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
