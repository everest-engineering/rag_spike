History:	40 YO FEMALE HX OF SZ AND NONEPILEPTIC SZ. P/W SZ.
Medications:	Phenobarbital
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently the left hemisphere (maximal
midtemporal) and the right midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
They can at times occur in semi-monomorphic runs with no clear evolution. At times they appear
slightly sharply countoured but not epileptic.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left hemispheric, Mainly midtemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the left hemisphere (maximal
midtemporal) and the right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. In addition there  is
diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
