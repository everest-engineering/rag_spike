CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old left handed woman with epilepsy, currently seizure free,
now compliant with medications. Past history of seizures with loss of
consciousness and confusion, not otherwise described to the technologist.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and theta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving.

HR: 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. Extended
sleep was not obtained which would have been needed to more clearly evaluate a
central sharp wave.
