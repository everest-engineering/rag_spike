CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old woman status post recent carotid stent placement
with progressive encephalopathy and asterixis. Difficulty finding the right word. Recent
negative MRI for infarct but positive Tox screen.

MEDICATIONS: Levothroid, Hydrochlorothiazide, Diovan, Zocor, ASA, Pantoprazole,
ISOSORBIDE, Metoprolol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20

system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake with
frequent eye blink.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes primarily rhythmic
theta with 5 Hz and 7 Hz activity as well as smaller amounts of delta. Muscle artifact
produces some artifacts. Features of drowsiness include a decrease in eye movements
as well as an increase in delta. There are a handful of triphasic waves noted in the
record which can be differentiated from the patient's eye movements.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

1. The presence of rhythmic background theta.
2. Triphasic waves.
3. Generalized slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are nonspecific but are
relatively characteristic for a metabolic encephalopathy. No significant focal features

were observed and there were no epileptiform features although this is a sharply
contoured record.
