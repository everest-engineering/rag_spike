History:	68 year old man with a history of a recent left sided stroke at an outside hospital.
Medications:	Dilantin, Namenda, Aricept, Plavix, Lipitor, Coreg, Norvasc
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, right temporal, anterior
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to intermittent moderate right
anterior temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
