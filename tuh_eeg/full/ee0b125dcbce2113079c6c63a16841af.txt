History:	50 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF  HEP C, SZ, POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE,
DEPRESSION,BIPOLAR, SCHIZO AFFECT, SUICIDE ATTEMPTS.   DM, COPD.
PRESENTS WITH SEIZURES S/P ASSAULT CT NEG., + ALCOHOL, COCAINE,
OPIATE, BENZO AND PCP.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording
and increases during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, bilateral diffuse
No epileptiform discharges
No focal slowing
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
