History:		56 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CVA IN 2014 WITH RT SIDED RESIDUAL AND SPEECH IMPAIRMENT. 1 HOUR EEG REQUESTED.
Medications:	Keppra 500 mg BID
Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
None
Extended, 40-60 min
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The waking background is reactive and asymmetric. The right hemisphere is well-organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 11 Hz, which attenuates with eye opening.  The left hemisphere is disorganized with continuous polymorphic slowing and no definite posterior dominant rhythm.
Drowsiness is characterized by mild background slowing and attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm. Sleep transients are not captured during this study.
There is continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing. Of note, the right fronto-temporal leads are frequently obscured by muscle artifact.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second {fps} does not produce any effect. Hyperventilation is not performed. A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric Disorganization, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing and disorganization in the left hemisphere. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. Of note, the right fronto-temporal leads are frequently obscured by muscle artifact; a repeat study to assess this region may be performed if warranted .
