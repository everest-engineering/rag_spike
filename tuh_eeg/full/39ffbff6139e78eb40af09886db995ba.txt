History:	58 year old woman status post meningioma resection, now slow to wake up.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and
delta activity.
Additional, continuous polymorphic delta activity at higher amplitudes is present over the left
anterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no clear change in the
background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli, but video demonstrates that
patient briefly opens her eyes and moves during stimulation.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, left temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal portable 23-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing with
additional continuous focal left anterior temporal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate
to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing
is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
