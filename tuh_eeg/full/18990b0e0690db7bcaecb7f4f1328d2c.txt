History:	50 YR OLD MALE WITH PRIOR EEG ADMIT ON 3/16/14 WITH GTC SZ,  HAS H/O
SUBSTANCE ABUSE. PMHS SIG FOR  RT  MESIAL TEMP
SCLEROSIS,DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY, HTN,
Medications:	DILANTIN, LORAZEPAM, LOVENOX, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Some mild frontal alpha of unclear
significance.  HR 96
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
