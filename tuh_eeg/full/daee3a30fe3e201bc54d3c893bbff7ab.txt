CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with refractory seizures, right MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Depakote, Keppra..
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient recalled pushing the button on 2 occasions for left hemibody tremulousness.  The seizures were not apparent to anyone other than the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In much of the record the patient is awake with asymmetry with a lower voltage, more suppressed pattern on the right compared to the left.
In wakefulness, particularly around 9:40 to 10:00 p.m. on 03/05/2013, there is prolonged bursts of intermittent waxing and waning rhythmic theta from the left temporal region.  No clinical features were noted by the team and there was no push button for this.  This pattern reemerges at 10:13 p.m.  The patient seems to be awake throughout much of the night with this pattern of more rhythmic theta coming and going from the left.
During other sections of the record, focal slowing from the right hemisphere is noted with sharply contoured activity.  Independent sharp waves are noted from the right mid temporal region, but from the left there is a more of a pattern of sharply contoured slowing.
The patient pushed the button on 2 occasions at 5:04 p.m. and 5:46 p.m.  There was no definitive change in the EEG at that time.  The patient is awake and the video resolution does not identify the left hemibody twitching.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  During this 24-hour section of the record the patient's independent push buttons did not carry an EEG signature.  There appears to be an interictal discharge with prominent, rhythmic sharply contoured activity on the left raising concerns for a subclinical ictal pattern from the contralateral hemisphere.  Vertex waves and spindles were seen in stage 2 sleep.
