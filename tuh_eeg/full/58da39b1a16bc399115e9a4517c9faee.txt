CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old woman with tonic colonic seizures, seizure free for the last 3 years.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are-performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage, but there is a discernible 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm in a background of generous beta. Much of the record includes drowsiness with attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the record. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. The features described above, including the low voltage pattern and scant alpha are not pathologic in this age group. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be considered, particularly when capturing deeper stages of sleep.
