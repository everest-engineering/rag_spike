History:	32 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF EPISODES OF PRE SYNCOPE AND SYNCOPE.
LAST SYNCOPE 9/14.  PT NOW JUST HAS FEELS WARM, SEES BRIGHTNESS,
NAUSEOUS WILL SIT AND WILL SLOWLY RECOVER.  ABOUT 3 X WK.  PMHX:
ANXIETY, MENINGITIS BABY.
Medications:	KLONOPIN, ZYRTEC
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 11 to 13 fps.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
