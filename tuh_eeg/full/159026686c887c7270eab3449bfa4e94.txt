CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old woman with past history of TIA, diabetes, transferred from an outside hospital for bilateral or left upper extremity shaking, eyes rolling back in her head, right posterior cerebral artery infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Insulin, Prandin, ASA
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside, portable EEG, standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had scabies, which can impact the quality of the scalp electrode placement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This lower voltage, bedside portable EEG, is remarkable for an awake individual with generous beta.  It is difficult to identify an alpha rhythm on either side, but there is more of a suggestion of an 11 Hz alpha on the left compared to the right.  Muscle artifact obscures significant portions of the EEG.  As the patient drifts off to sleep vertex waves are noted.  FIRDA is also observed.  Vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep are higher amplitude than the rest of her otherwise low voltage EEG.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A low voltage pattern in wakefulness.
Excess beta.
Questionable attenuation of the alpha rhythm on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The excess beta may represent medication affect.  There was little in the way of focal features with a previous right PCA infarct, but a follow up
study when the patient is able to cooperate may be able to produce a more comprehensive evaluation.  No sharp waves were seen in this or in the 2 prior EEGs.
