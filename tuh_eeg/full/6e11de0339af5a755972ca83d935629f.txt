CLINICAL HISTORY: 	46 year old woman 4 days status post lung transplantation off sedation,  but still excessively lethargic.

MEDICATION: Dilaudid, Xanax, Morphine, Midazolam, Famotidine, Metronidazole, Simulect, Methyl prednisone, Vanco, Bactroban,  Meropenem, Insulin

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.  She demonstrates eye movements.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern, mixed frequency, but it is very slow. There is theta interrupted by lower voltage slow delta. The pattern demonstrates reactivity and variability. Some portions are richer  in beta frequency activity or muscle artifact.

HR:	120 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with a mixture of rhythmic theta.
2.  Slow arrhythmic delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. A significant toxic or metabolic encephalopathy may be considered, as could medication effect.
