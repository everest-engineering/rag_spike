CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old male with episodes in which he has lapses in registering.  Speech may be slow.  Spells occur 1-7 times per day, particularly under stress.  Normal neurological examination.
MEDICATIONS:  No seizure medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an observed study with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The technologist was present and notified the patient to inform him if the patient felt that he was about to have a spell.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta and a small amount of background theta.
In maximal wakefulness, there is a well-defined, 9.2 hertz alpha rhythm.  There is also a small amount of theta in the 6-7 hertz range noted.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing bursts of high amplitude, frontally predominant paroxysmal slowing.  As the patient became drowsy, there were a handful of bursts of shifting slowing, some of which were more notable in the left hemisphere and some of which were sharply contoured.  Features of sleep included POSTS.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta for a young adult in wakefulness.
Some shifting slowing a bit more remarkable on the left noted in the transition to sleep, at times sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The background theta described above is a nonspecific entity and correlation with any central nervous system acting medications and clinical history is important.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged, 24-hour study is advised.
