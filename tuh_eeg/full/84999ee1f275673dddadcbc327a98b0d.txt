CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed female with history of seizures since September 11, 2011 and developmental delay.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tramadol, Loratadine, Diovan
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
