AGE: 59 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/01/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE: routine awake and drowsy
HISTORY:
59 YR OLD FEMALE LEFT HANDED. PT SAYS SHE FELL IN HER APARTMENT AND WHEN SHE WOKE UP SHE WAS IN ED. PMHX., NO H/0 SZ. DM TYPE 2
MEDICATIONS:
Insulin Aspirin Lovenox Tylenol
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed Photic Stimulation: Not performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG . There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
If clinically warranted, a recording with sleep may be helpful.
