History:	61 year old woman with a history of seizures, who presents with several typical
Medications:	Topamax, Keppra, Ativan, Advair, Pravachol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The background over the right hemisphere consists of 9-10 Hz alpha activity with preserved AP
gradient.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen over the left.  The
posterior dominant rhythm over the left is fragmented and reaches maximally 9 Hz.  The
background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic continuous theta and delta activity,
that is more pronounced over the frontotemporal region.  Occasionally, rhythmic delta activity is
noted over the left.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, most pronounced frontotemporally
Focal slowing, rhythmic, occasional, left hemispheric
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to continuous moderate left
hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the left frontotemporal region. This finding is
indicative of a focal cerebral dysfunction, either structural or post-ictal in etiology.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
