History:	87 YR OLD female Presented 8/31 WITH SOB/DUE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY
INSUFFICIENCY, LIKELY ACUTE SYSTOLIC HF. CT OF HEAD 9/3 SHOWED
SUBACUTE INFARCT IN RT PARIETAL LOBE, never extubated, still somnolent
Medications:	No AEDs
No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present which at best reach 8Hz.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse disorganized delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior
to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present with phase
reversal at C4/P4, some with a large field.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, right posterior quadrant
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right posterior quadrant
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  occasional focal slowing and epileptiform discharges in
the right posterior quadrant.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal
structural lesion in the region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
