REASON FOR STUDY:  Right facial/right sided weakness, rule out seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 71-year-old woman with acute onset of right facial and right-sided weakness along with slurred speech and a past medical history of stroke, diabetes, hypertension and asthma.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin and gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, mainly in sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is mainly recorded in sleep but in the limited wakefulness there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz.  There is normal frontocentral beta during this limited wakefulness.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded again mainly in sleep with stage I and II recorded.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in limited wakefulness and mainly in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG with limited wakefulness and mainly asleep reveals no clear abnormalities.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
