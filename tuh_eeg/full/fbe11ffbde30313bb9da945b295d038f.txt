CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old male with a history of seizures who presents with multiple seizures in the emergency room.  He was given Ativan and Keppra and intubated.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Tylenol, Rocephin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior, temporal, and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The recording was performed during wakefulness and lethargy.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low-voltage diffusely slow background in the delta frequency.  No posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta is seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves seen at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts continuously.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta seen (FIRDA).
During the recording, the patient was stimulated and there appears to be increase in muscle artifact and mild increase in the frequency to theta frequency.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
