CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 52-year-old woman who had been seizure free off seizure medications but admitted with a follow-up seizure, elevated CPK, and worsening weakness.  MRI without evidence of new stroke.  Past meningioma resection in 2003.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Tegretol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation accentuates a focal slowing in the left mid temple region.  Stage 2 includes vertex K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.
Heart rate 80 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Left mid-temporal focal slowing with somewhat rhythmic left mid-temporal delta in hyperventilation and less prominent in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing identified on the left is more prominent than was noted in an EEG last month.  This may be attributed to the patient's postictal state.  This is her sixth EEG.
