CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old female with history of Crohn's disease and epilepsy, well controlled.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T3, as well as F4, independently at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Focal sharp waves seen at F4 at times in runs, lasting for up to 20 seconds with no clinical correlate during those runs.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal sharp waves and slowing.
Left mid temporal focal slowing.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region and some evidence of mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
