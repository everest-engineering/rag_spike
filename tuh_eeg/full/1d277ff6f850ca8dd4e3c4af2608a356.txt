History:	44 YO MALE PRESENTS ON 10/10/2015 FROM JEANES WITH SEPSIS OF
UNCLEAR ETIOLOGY PT REMAINED INTUBATED AND SEDATED. PT NOW
TRACHED AND OFF SEDATION SINCE YESTERDAY. MRI ON 10/18 REVEALED
EXTENSIVE INFECTION IN LLE INVOLVING  BONE..
Medications:	INSULIN, FAMOTIDINE, CEFAZOLIN, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. At
times a more organized A-P gradient with faster frontal frequencies can be seen with stimulation.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to tactile and
painful stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
