CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old female with multiple medical problems presents now with a seizure this morning.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, Dilantin, Fentanyl.
REASON FOR EEG:  Episode of seizure activity in the morning.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside used standard 10-20 electrode placement system anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  The patient was obtunded during the recording and no activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some mild movement artifact during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens up to a diffusely disorganized background that at best is in the theta frequencies.  No posterior dominant rhythm or normal signs of central beta is seen.  No abnormal sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F3, C3 continuously.
Focal sharp waves seen at C3, F3, at times at T3 and sometimes at F4 and P4.
Generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Multiple focal sharp waves seen mainly in the left frontal and central region and at times in the right frontocentral region with some posterior ones in addition to left frontocentral slow waves and generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with localization-related seizures arising from multiple foci.  There is also evidence of multiple areas of cortical irritability and focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontocentral region which may be due to diffuse metabolic or infectious process affecting the cortex.
In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  These findings were communicated to the team.  No seizures were seen.
