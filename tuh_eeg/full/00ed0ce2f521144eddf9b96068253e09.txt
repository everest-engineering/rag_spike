CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old gentleman with epilepsy.  Patient experiences an aura of right hand numbness followed by left eye twitching and then postictal exhaustion.  The symptoms have been increasing, most recent 3 days ago.  Patient wass seen in the emergency room on June 1st for seizure during Bible study.  Patient admitted to the hospital in May of 2013 for increasing small seizures at home.  Diabetes, not well controlled. Strong family history of Epilepsy
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, insulin, lisinopril, and ?Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of  T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 70 microvolts.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Abundant vertex waves, spindles, and K-complexes were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Patient appears to be relatively drowsy, drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation, which nonetheless did elicit a driving response.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if this patient is thought to have seizures, a more prolonged study or recording one of this patient's events may be of value.
