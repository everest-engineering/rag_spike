CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 66-year-old woman unresponsive after PEA code, 15-minute down time.  Pneumonia
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Protonix, Coreg, Morphine and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring begins in the evening of the 22nd in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, relatively suppressed pattern.  No formal stimulation was performed, but tactile stimulation with nurse at bedside does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  Irregular 90 bpm.
February 23rd to 24th: no interval history is provided.  Medications:  See above.
The background EEG during this section of the record demonstrates a very low voltage, featureless record.  The patient is on a cooling blanket on the morning of the 24th.  The EEG demonstrates a markedly suppressed low voltage pattern with scant cerebral activity and primarily EKG and other ICU artifacts.  Auditory and tactile stimulation of the patient were not documented.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal 48-hour continuous video EEG monitoring due to
Marked suppression of cerebral activity.
Although limited examination of the patient was documented, little in the way of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  If the history and conditions described above are correct, this pattern is a worrisome finding following cardiac arrest.
