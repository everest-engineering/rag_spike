SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation. She has right cranial scars.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is low voltage but symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. Head rocking artifact is picked up in drowsiness
No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation:	Was deferred
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces scant symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead. Occ PVCs
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal, low voltage Awake and drowsy	routine EEG. There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. There is some head rocking artifact due to skull deformity but no definitive focal slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy routine EEG. A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
