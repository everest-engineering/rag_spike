CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left parietal meningioma, diabetes, occasional leg fatigue or leg twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, canagliflozin, Flonase, pravastatin, Singulair, Zoloft, metoprolol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record. Patient has a midline skull defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm noted with generous, frontocentral beta.  A slight amplitude asymmetry is noted particularly when the patient is drowsy with sometimes higher amplitude activity on the right, compatible with a breach rhythm.  Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart Rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 1-hour EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform seizures were seen.  This is the 6th EEG for this individual, and none thus far have had epileptiform features.  The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
