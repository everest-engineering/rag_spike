History:	57 year old woman with a left ICA aneurysm.  Case ended early due to a narrow
size of the vessel with no stenting performed.
Medications:	FENTANYL, PRECEDEX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently seen.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta is present.
Patient is awake throughout the procedure.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
occasional tachycardia with heart rate above 100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 46 minute awake-only intraoperative EEG. The procedure was aborted due to
a small caliber of the vessel.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
