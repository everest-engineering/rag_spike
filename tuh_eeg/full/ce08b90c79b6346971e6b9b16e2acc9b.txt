CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old woman with diabetes, sleep apnea, and a single, nocturnal seizure with tongue biting.  Seizure 1 year ago followed by headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, nitroglycerine, Paxil, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically challenging EEG.  Although, there was impedance with overall acceptable, there is a fair amount of muscle and other electrical artifacts noted in the EEG.  In addition, the patient appears to be quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage.  With stimulation, prominent, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.
Photic stimulation was performed and did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, low voltage EEG in a hypersomnolent patient of questionable technical validity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Some normal waveforms such as rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness and a photic driving response were identified.  Additional testing and interaction with this patient would have been valuable to make certain that the patient was adequately stimulated.  A repeat study in the lab assessing adequate wakefulness is suggested, although there are no epileptiform features noted in the record and there are sections of the record with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.
