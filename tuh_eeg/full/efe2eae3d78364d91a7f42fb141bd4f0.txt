CLINICAL HISTORY:   59 year old male with a multiple episode of loss of consciousness, bradycardia, and hypertension.  One episode was associated with bowel incontinence.  Past medical history is significant for neck mass.  The patient apparently needed a pacemaker, but he was refusing.  The patient had a questionable episode prior to EEG with confusion, garbled speech.  The patient was clammy and sweaty at the time.
MEDICATIONS:  Atropine, Lovenox, Isuprel
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and II sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined, but low voltage, posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz, which was reactive to eye opening.  The patient has a low voltage background with a transition into sleep, in and out of sleep stage II.  The patient was difficult to wake up during the EEG monitoring.  The patient showed a normal pattern toward the end of the EEG. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG with low voltage.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There was no seizure or epileptiform discharges seen.
Note:  The low voltage EEG is a normal finding.
