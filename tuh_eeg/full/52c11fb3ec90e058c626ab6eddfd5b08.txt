REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old woman with history of change in mental status of unknown etiology.  Significant history of hypertension, depression, diabetes, osteoarthritis.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Zosyn, Lopressor, insulin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of 1 anterior temporal and single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely disorganized background that has posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  Overall there is diffuse theta and delta slowing, mainly in the theta frequencies, some disorganization of the background.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen almost continuously at 1 Hz at O1 more than O2 consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS).
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to occipital (left more than right) PLEDS and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the occipital region.  In addition, there is evidence of structural dysfunction irritability in the occipital region, which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  Lastly there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
