LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Twenty-two minutes.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of fast and slow alpha variants.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess beta is present.  During sleep, POSTS (posterior occipital sharp transience of sleep), sleep spindles and vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation produces no significant change in background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  EKG artifacts captured occasionally.
FINDINGS:
Staged sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep, 22-minute study.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be seen as a result of medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
