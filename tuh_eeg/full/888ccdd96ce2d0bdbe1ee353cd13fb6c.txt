CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the trauma ICU after a fall.  Hypercapnic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, episodes of eye deviation 1 day previously, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  FENTANYL DRIP 2.5, HEPARIN, SYNTHROID, LEVOTHYROXINE, ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN, YESTERDAY HYDROMORPHINE, TOPROL, TYLENOL 3
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent throughout, but this EEG does manage to capture wakefulness and sleep in an intubated adult.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite muscle and other artifacts, in maximal wakefulness, there is a low voltage, well organized pattern with a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and central beta and alpha frequency activity.  Drowsiness was characterized by a lower voltage theta pattern.  In sleep, vertex waves were identified.
Heart rate, irregular 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record, but a normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study, when the patient is out of the ICU, can be considered.
