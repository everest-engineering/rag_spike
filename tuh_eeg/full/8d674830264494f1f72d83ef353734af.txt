CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed male with Parkinson disease, status post fall with skull fracture and scarring on the left side of the brain or skull.  The patient subsequently has difficulty verbalizing his thoughts.

MEDICATIONS:  Cialis, Flomax, Azilect, Sinemet, Zocor, Lisinopril, Singulair, ASA, Doxazosin, HCTZ

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm identified.  The alpha rhythm on the left is slightly higher amplitude than the right.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements.  On rare occasions, there is a slight accentuation of beta in the left frontal region.  Deep stages of sleep are not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  There is a single burst of slowing in the right frontal region.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm identified above is an anticipated finding following a skull or cranial injury.  This might account for the higher amplitude alpha on the left and the beta accentuation.  No epileptiform features were identified.
