REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old man with history of seizures since February 2012 with multiple seizures, the last one 3 days ago described as lightheadedness, sweating profusely, no memory, was told that he was answering "who are they" and their name.  He also had some while driving and crashed.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.

Activating procedures, which included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges and hyperventilation has right anterior temporal slowing.

Abnormal discharges:
1. Focal sharp waves seen at F8/T4, mainly in drowsiness, but also in wakefulness.
2. Focal slow waves were seen infrequently at F8/T4 at a frequency of 1-2 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
3. There is also intermittent F7/T3 focal slowing also at 1-2 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At one point one of them is slightly sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptic.
4. At times during drowsiness some of the right anterior temporal sharp waves appears to be very small and spiky and have a more of a morphology of benign epileptiform transients of sleep.  However, the fact that they are not seen on the left hemisphere at all, or very infrequently, suggest that this might be more epileptic rather than BETS (Benign Epileptiform Transient of Sleep)

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right anterior temporal sharp waves, as well as slowing with some mild intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.
