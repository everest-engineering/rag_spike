CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old woman admitted on the 20th with acute stroke, characterized by numbness, weakness, and slurred speech, and found to have left frontal meningioma.  Previously evaluated for seizure-like symptoms 1 year ago.  History of panic attacks.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed but hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of frontocentral beta.  A breach rhythm was noted with higher amplitude activity in the left frontocentral region as well as accentuation of faster frequency activity in that region.  Characteristics of sleep including increase in beta with some left temporal wicket.  MU rhythm was identified but testing was not performed to confirm this.  The patient frequently transitioned in and out of a drowsy state.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to focal slowing from the left frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd EEG for this adult without epileptiform activity.  The focal slowing and breach rhythm has been previously identified and is characteristic of a post craniotomy patient.  In this individual with intermittent, right-sided numbness, a followup study either with more prolonged sleep or catching one of her spells of unilateral numbness is suggested.
