CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old woman status post cardiac arrest on September 16,
2009 at 12:45 a.m. for 30 minutes. The patient is now being treated with hypothermia
and has been cooled to a temperature of 31.7 degrees.
MEDICATIONS: Versed, Fentanyl, Lidocaine, Nitroglycerin, Plavix. ASA, Zocor,
Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage
but relatively continuous pattern with low voltage beta. There are intermittent bursts of
rhythmic lower voltage 3 Hz activity which are also picked up in the eye channels but do
appear to be cerebral in nature. There is an occasional head bob which is associated
with muscle artifact but without an ictal signature. On some occasions, a more clearly
defined myoclonic jerk is observed again producing artifact but without a clear change in
the cerebral pattern. Tactile stimulation does seem to produce an alerting with an
increase in alpha and beta frequency activity.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a lower voltage pattern of faster
frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are of unclear clinical significance. The
features described above may be in part due to medications. The hypothermia may also
play a role in this pattern. There is no evidence of subclinical status epilepticus, and
there are no specific worrisome features identified in the acute EEG.
