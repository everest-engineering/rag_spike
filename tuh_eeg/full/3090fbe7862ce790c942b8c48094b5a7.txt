History:	44 year old woman with a history of seizures who has been seizure-free for ~3 years.
She, however, has headaches that are worsening.
Medications:	Depakote. See other in chart
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  Bursts of diffuse moderate-to-high amplitude sharply
contoured delta activity are captured during drowsiness.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges are present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
