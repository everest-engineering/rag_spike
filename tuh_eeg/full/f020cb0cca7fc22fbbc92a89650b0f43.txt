CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old male with anxiety attack versus seizure on August 5, 2015 prior to ankle surgery.  The patient had a 20-minute episode of body shaking as an outpatient.
MEDICATIONS:  No seizure medications reported.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.  The patient was drifting off to sleep in the end of the record, including falling asleep in photic stimulation.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and K complexes.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving despite the fact that the patient was falling asleep.
Heart rate:  78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged study may be of value.
