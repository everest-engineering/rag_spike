CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed female with left carotid stenosis, cerebral aneurysm, TIA, multiple sclerosis, cardiac stents, myocardial infarction, hypertension and right lumpectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Fentanyl, Midazolam, Rocuronium
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with1 channel EKG. Recording begins with the patient awake. Total recording time approximately 3 hours. Standard CEA montage was utilized.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake. There is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous beta a small amount of theta.
Induction of anesthesia produces a discontinuous pattern with some shifting asymmetries.
The carotid is clamped at 10:26. This produces an asymmetry with dropout of alpha and beta frequency activity on the left and the right. These findings are reported immediately to the tech. The position unclamped the carotid at 11:05.
The frontocentral regions become a bit more symmetric by 11:20. The asymmetries in the EEG abate as the recording starts to conclude. At 11:40, there is a burst of bilateral delta, this time a bit more on the right than the left. There is no mention made as to change in anesthesia. The record ends at 11:47
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION/CONCLUSION: EEG monitoring during this left carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for focal changes. These gradually improved.
