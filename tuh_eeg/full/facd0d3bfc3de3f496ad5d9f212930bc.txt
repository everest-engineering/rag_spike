CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed male with depression, aneurysm and epilepsy, cerebral palsy admitted on 8/23/2010, for seizure.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Sertraline, Norvasc, Amlodipine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is generous beta noted in the record. In addition, there is a slight asymmetry with a bit more delta on the right and a very subtle underlying complex with sharply contoured slowing in the right hemisphere including central and temporal regions. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. The patient is awakened for photic stimulation as a sharp wave is noted in the right frontocentral region with an unusual field of spread and a little bit later spread to the temporal regions. Photic stimulation elicits driving which is better identified on the left compared to the right.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
2. Sharp waves in the right hemisphere including frontocentral and temporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This was the first EEG for this individual that demonstrated right focal slowing and sharp waves. This may be due to the fact that the EEG was recorded immediately after the patient's seizures.
