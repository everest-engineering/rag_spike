WOUNDS. ADMIT FOR PRE-SYNCOPE/ SYNCOPE, PT DENIES LOC.
Medications:	KEPPRA, ATIVAN, INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse 7Hz theta activity is present throughout the recording and
increases during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
There is independent bitemporal focal slowing, greater on the left side (F7-T1).  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, bilateral (L>R) temporal, independent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  intermittent
focal slowing in the bitemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
