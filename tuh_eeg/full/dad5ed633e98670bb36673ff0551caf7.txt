History:	75 YO MALE ETOH DAILY. REPORTED TO ED WITH POSSIBLE ALCOHOL SZ.
PMHX: ETOH ABUSE, HTN, GLAUCOMA, HLD, ATYPICAL ANGINA, NSVT,
HFPEP, DM
Medications:	Serax, lipitor, aspirin, insulin, labetalol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  At times, there is an intermittent central alpha discharge.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The EEG had some mild variability
and reactivity to verbal stimuli.  HR was 66.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
