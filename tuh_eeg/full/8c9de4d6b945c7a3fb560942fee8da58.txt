History:	43 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Last reported seizure in 2/2015.
Medications:	Dilantin, Abilify, Elavil and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal PDR reaches 9 Hz.  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess theta activity
is captured.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
