CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed female with a history of diabetes and seizures in 2005, another event in 2007.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T1 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At times the slowing is sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptiform and also occurs in runs.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
