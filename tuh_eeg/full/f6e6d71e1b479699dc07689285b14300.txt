CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with possible epilepsy.  Patient fell down the stairs, had convulsive activity without loss of consciousness.  Past history of head trauma and weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  zocor, Plavix,  no seizure medicines reported
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG in wakefulness is abnormal.  In addition, there is an asymmetry between the right and left hemispheres.  The left hemisphere includes a mixture of beta and theta with a suggestion of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The right hemisphere demonstrates an irregular pattern with intermittent attenuation on the right.  In addition, when there are bursts of more rhythmic theta on the right, sharp waves are noted with variable maximum in the right hemisphere including F8, T6, O2 or almost right hemispheric.  There are bursts of sharply contoured activity noted as well as bursts of sharply contoured theta out of the right hemisphere.
Heart rate irregular 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Very irritative appearance in the right hemisphere with multifocal sharps throughout the right hemisphere.
Bursts of sharply contoured theta or rhythmic theta out of the right hemisphere.
Intermittent attenuation out of the right.
Modest disorganization on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded, but this is a very irritative-appearing EEG.  If there is any concern about ongoing seizures, EEG monitoring may be of value.
