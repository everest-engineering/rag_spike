SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE: Â·
A 21 channel bedside portable electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is reactive, but is abnormal . There is a 7-8 hertz alpha rhythm identified, present bilaterally.	The
awake record is interrupted by bursts of irregular, bihemispheric delta
Shifting slowing was noted
Moderate generalized slowing is present.	Shifting focal slowing is present.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta and delta
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an	abnormal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
generalized background slowing
shifting slowing
There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function . This pattern is nonspecific in terms of etiology. There are no epileptiform features.	Despite the previous craniotomy, there is no prominent breach rhythm
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
