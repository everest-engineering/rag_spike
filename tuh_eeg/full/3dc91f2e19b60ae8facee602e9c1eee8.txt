CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed male with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATION: Fentanyl, VEC, Propofol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The recording begins at 11:29
and concludes at 2:14. This was a 3 hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is awake. There
is a low voltage pattern. Quickly, by 11:55, medications have been administered and the background demonstrates slowing. Following the induction of anesthesia, a
symmetric pattern is observed notable at 12:07 with generous beta and some shifting
asymmetry.
Heparin is administered at 12:47. The carotid is clamped at 12:50. At that time it is a
relatively low voltage pattern with generous theta. There is some head rocking artifact
observed in the left temporal electrode. No other significant focal features are noted
with the clamp. The recording is continuous until patency is confirmed by Doppler at
2:05.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this carotid
endarterectomy did not identify significant focal features.
