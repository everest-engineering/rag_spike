STUDY DATE:  01/15/2013 to 01/16/2013 for a total of 24 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Qualification differential. Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 53-year-old woman with recurrent seizures here for differential qualification.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.  Continuous spike and wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurses notes along with patient's alarm and events were used to evaluate EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hertz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep including REM.
Abnormal Discharges: Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and F8/T4 but not clearly epileptic.  This is seen at a frequency at 2-4 Hertz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
Seizures or Events:  None captured.  Please note that the patient did complain of having episode of leg shaking around 8:30 p.m. but no EEG correlate could be seen during this episode and no video was clearly seen of this leg shaking.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral (Left more than right) anterior temporal area focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral (Left more than right) anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
