CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old female, status post craniectomy on the right with massive edema in the right hemisphere.  The patient's ventriculostomy was removed today and then she had 2 seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra, Dilantin, Gentamicin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is very slow, featureless with lower voltage delta on the right.  From the left, there is some sharply contoured activity in the left and sharply contoured quasi-periodic delta on the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact, again more so on the left than the right.  In this poorly responsive patient, there is occasional eye movement artifact.
HR:   150 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A markedly low voltage slow pattern on the right.
Some sharply contoured activity on the left.
A markedly slow delta pattern on the left..
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG suggests a significant bihemispheric process.  No sustained seizures were noted, although there is some sharply contoured focal slowing.
