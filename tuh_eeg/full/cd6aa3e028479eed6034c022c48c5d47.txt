History:	26 year old right-handed woman with staring spells where she is aware but cannot
talk back. She has 2-3 episodes a day. She sometimes has associated incontinence
and tongue biting.
Medications:	None
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also
seen.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR was 84.  At the outset of the study, the patient became unresponsive and
exhibited some infrequent head movements, and eye blinking seen on video. Despite questioning,
she remained unresponsive.  The background EEG did not exhibit changes in cerebral activity.
Over the course of the study, she became more alert and was able to participate in the
hyperventilation.  This clinical event likely represented a non-epileptic event.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The single episode of unresponsiveness was
not associated with changes in cerebral activity and thus represented a non-epileptic event.
However, the full event was not captured and thus a repeat or more prolonged study may be
