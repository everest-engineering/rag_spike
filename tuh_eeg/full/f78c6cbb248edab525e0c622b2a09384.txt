CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 12. The patient continues to have 3 nocturnal seizures per week. Complicated history of diabetes, hypertension, aortic valve repair, migraine headache and heart problems since birth requiring multiple surgeries.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Digoxin, Coumadin, Diovan, Bumex, ASA, Toprol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an almost exclusively sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a stage I and stage II sleep with frequent transitions between stage I and stage II. There are vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.  Some of the vertex waves are somewhat asymmetric. While most are maximum at CZ, they have a more generous field of spread and the diphasic wave is significantly higher amplitude and more prolonged on the left compared to the right. The composition of the wave forms, however, is quite similar with a 0.97 hertz after going slow wave. Brief wakefulness includes a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not activate the record, significant snore artifact is noted.
HR:  N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Asynchronous vertex waves with more prominent field of spread on the left in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's sleep pattern with frequent transitions between stage I and stage II sleep and prominent snoring may be part of an underlying sleep disturbance and can contribute to the nocturnal seizures. The asynchronous sleep wave forms may be correlated with imaging. No definitive epileptiform findings were noted, however.
