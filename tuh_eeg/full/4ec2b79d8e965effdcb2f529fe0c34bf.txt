History:	25 year old woman who is pregnant, now with a first time seizure.  This is a follow-
up EEG.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed since patient is pregnant.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  EKG artifact is
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EKG
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
