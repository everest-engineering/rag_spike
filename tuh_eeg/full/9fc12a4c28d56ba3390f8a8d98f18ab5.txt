CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 78-year-old woman of unknown handedness, adult-onset epilepsy.  The patient presented with confusional spell, was found to have UTI, septic physiology, NSTEMI.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, norepinephrine, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, somnolent, but able to respond to tactile stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG, with  the patient resting quietly is diffusely slow with a mixture prominent rhythmic theta, which is sharply contoured, as well as arrhythmic delta.  Shifting slowing is noted.  In this sharply contoured record, there are underlying sharp waves noted in the right temporal and central temporal region.  When the patient is unstimulated, there is an increase in delta and there are subtle, frontally predominant triphasic waves noted.  With auditory stimulation or spontaneous arousals, there is an increase in theta.  Asterixis can be demonstrated with movements of the upper extremities (the patient examined with clinical team at bedside and the asterixis in the upper extremities was not associated with a change in the EEG).
Heart rate irregular, 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Sharply contoured, but abnormal EEG due to:
A disorganized and slow pattern.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
In this sharply contoured record, there are definitive sharp waves noted in the right central temporal region.
Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above suggest more than one process.  The background slowing disorganization of triphasic waves can be seen in the context of metabolic
encephalopathy.  The focal sharp waves suggest a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  No seizures were recorded.  The study may be compared with this patient's previous records.
