CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old male with change in mental status, found to have renal insufficiency and hemolysis this morning, hypertension, diabetes, prostate cancer, and hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Insulin, Hydrocortisone, Zosyn, Aranesp
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz, but does appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
