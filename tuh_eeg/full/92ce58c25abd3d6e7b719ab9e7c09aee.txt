CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old left handed male with history of traumatic brain injury in 2002 with subsequent seizures, having about 2 generalized tonic-clonic seizure a week, reports recent seizure activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were performed including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 and T4 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reach 7-8 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation produces some accentuation of the focal slowing, which I will mention below.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing seen intermittently at F7/T3 and at times at F8/T4 (slightly more on the left than the right) at a frequency 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SLEEP:  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, in addition to mild generalized slowing in addition to mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
