CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with trisomy 21, admitted with right hand shaking and numbness, alleviated by Ativan.  History of epilepsy since age 12, but seizure free for the last 2 years.  Also intermittent episodes of total body shaking and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, metformin, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed, but photic stimulation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient appears to be excessively drowsy, but with stimulation, such as conversation or hyperventilation, the EEG demonstrates a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Without the stimulation, background theta is noted and more of a drowsy pattern is seen.  The overall record is relatively low voltage with generous beta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG does demonstrate an individual who is hypersomnolent.  If additional information is needed, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep or recording one of her shaky spells is suggested.
