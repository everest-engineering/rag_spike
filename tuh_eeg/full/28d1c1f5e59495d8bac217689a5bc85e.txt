CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old female NEW ONSET SZ WITH LOC, FALL, BLADDER INCONT AND CONFUSION, THE WEEK OF THE NOV. 18-2013. Parkinson's disease.

MEDICATIONS:  NO SZ MEDS

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an extended, 1 hour awake and drowsy record, technically satisfactory with all but 2 electrode impedances below 5 kOhms

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The technologist performed testing to make sure that the patient is maximally awake, but in maximal wakefulness, there is intermittent, paroxysmal, underlying 6 Hz theta.  In drowsiness, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness was noted.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicited driving at faster frequencies

HEART RATE: 60 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a greater than 40 minute EEG and is remarkable for:
1. Excess theta.
2. Intermittent, bursts of paroxysmal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic mid temporal theta described above is a normal finding.  The underlying theta noted in this record in apparent maximal wakefulness is a nonspecific finding and can be due to medications or other, mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
