CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old woman with recurrent syncope, found to have a
positive pregnancy test during her tilt table test.

MEDICATIONS: Steroid drops.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and an asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: An wakefulness there is 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation is performed early
on in the record producing an increase in theta. Drowsiness is characterized by an
increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
