History: 64 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/0 CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS WITH UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY. PMHX SIG FOR OA, DM, DEPRESSION, HTN// 9/13/13 SUDDEN ONSET CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS @1930 WITH UNRESPONSIVENESS, L SIDED GAZE
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type: Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, obtunded

Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring:
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 10 hours. Nursing-initiated event buttons were  correlated with clinical behavior. Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG technologists. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns. All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the attending neurologist.

# Push button events

Description of pushbutton events

Description:
A 6-7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was present that is minimally reactive. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Of note, the patient was disconnected from 10:15 AM until 5:35 PM. No normal sleep architecture was present.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present The right sided PLEDs seen on 9/14/2013 have disappeared. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse

This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing. Overall the record has improved since 9/14/2013. These findings were communicated to the primary care team.
