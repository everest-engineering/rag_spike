CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with posttraumatic epilepsy, seizure free from May 2013 to February 2014.  Primarily nocturnal convulsive seizures.  Right-sided head trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video 1 hour EEG was requested using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement 1 channel EKG.  Due to technical difficulties, only 54 minutes of data were obtained.  A right skull defect was noted.  Impedances were satisfactory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized.  There is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  A breach rhythm with arrhythmic delta was noted in the right hemisphere.  The delta is intermittent to continuous.  It is at times sharply contoured.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an accentuation of beta activity in the right hemisphere including frontal, central, and temporal regions.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, accentuating the focal slowing and producing some sharply contoured slowing as well as bursts of bilateral frontal delta.
The patient was relatively drowsy during photic stimulation and the focal slowing from the right hemisphere as well as some sharply contoured slowing was identified.  No significant driving response was noted.
EKG:  Low voltage, 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemisphere focal slowing, maximum in the right central temporal region.
Sharply contoured slowing.
Mild background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG, May 19, 2013, the focal features and disorganization have been previously described.  This EEG demonstrates less arrhythmic delta.  No right frontal spike and slow wave complexes were noted today, although they were seen 1 year ago.
