CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old woman with multiple strokes, past intracerebral hemorrhage, recent carotid endarterectomy admitted following an episode with generalized shaking. History of significant coronary artery disease, cognitive impairment and bilateral tubal ischemic disease.

MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Metoprolol, ASA, Norvasc, Isosorbide

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation, but photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with primarily a theta frequency background, superimposed arrhythmic delta activity prominent from the left temporal region and relatively prominent left temporal sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, the left anterior temporal sharp waves become somewhat more prominent as does the left temporal arrhythmic delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. By the end of the record, the activity from the right hemisphere is a bit better organized and with a brief alerting and an increase in alpha frequency activity as well as the appearance of POSTS on the right as she drifts off to sleep.

HR: 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed left temporal focal slowing.
3. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing, disorganization and left temporal focal slowing have been previously described, but the left temporal sharp waves are a new finding.
