CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 93-year-old woman admitted with acute onset dizziness and 2 episodes in which she could not find a word.  Evaluate for seizure or stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  ASA , losartan, Protonix, others.
ROOM NUMBER:  In-patient
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances generally under 5 KOhms with the exception of at T1 and T2 electrodes.  There is a small amount of muscle artifact noted in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was noted.  A small amount of background theta was identified.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increasingly synchronous background.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate 78 bpm.  Slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG at the bedside primarily in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This is a normal study.
