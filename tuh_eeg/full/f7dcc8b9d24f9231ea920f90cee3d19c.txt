CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed male with new-onset seizures in sleep, headaches, depression, aggressive behavior and visual hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of background theta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in rhythmic slowing. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 60bpm.
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. If epilepsy is an important considerationá, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered. The background slowing is nonspecific and it could. be due to medications or either CNS disturbance.
