History:	51 YO FEMALE WITH ANOXIC BRAIN INJURY SUFFERED I N 2011.
PT WAS IN STRETCHER WHEN ARRIVED , HUSBAND AND PT COULD GIVE NO
FURTHER INFORMATION..
TECH ASKED IF PT WAS HAVING SZ'S HUSBAND REPLIED "I DON'T KNOW"
Medications:	KEPPRA, LOPRESSOR, VALPROATE ACID, ALBUTEROL, LIPITOR,
ENOXAPARIN, BISACODYL, ATROPINE, HEPARIN, PREVACID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-30uV, 8-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is frequent monomorphic 6-7Hz theta activity seen throughout the
recording that varies with level of arousal and may reflect sleep.  During drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
did not induce a significant photic driving response.  Episodes of head movement noted by the
technologist do not have an ictal correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral generalized
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent mid-temporal slowing. No
epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Bitemporal slowing may
suggest a toxic-metabolic or structural effect.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
