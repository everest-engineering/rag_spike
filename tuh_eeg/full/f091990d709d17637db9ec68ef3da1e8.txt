CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old male with new onset seizures and status epilepticus.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lovenox, Pantoprazole

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a face mask and is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern with primarily delta frequency activity and prominent, arrhythmic delta activity, as well as prominent bursts and trains of left temporal sharp waves. Despite this, the patient is awake with eye opening and appears to be interactive and conversant with the clinical team, despite the face mask, 4 mg of Ativan, and the EEG pattern described above. Prominent left frontal temporal sharp waves are noted intermittently in the background. As the recording continues, these occur in bursts and trains, but without clear clinical correlate.

HR: 60 bpm and what appears to be a paced rhythm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Initially marked background slowing with primarily a delta background.
2. Left temporal focal slowing.
3. Left frontal temporal sharp waves, sometimes in bursts often, periodic, but without evidence of clinical impairment.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates a highly irritative focus. Of note, the patient was improving at the end of the record, but additional evaluation to make sure that there are no additional subclinical seizures or subtle seizures is suggested.
