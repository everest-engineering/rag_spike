History:	54 YR MALE WITH ETOH ABUSE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE HEP C, DM, HTN, ESRD
(HD MWF), SLEEP APNEA WITH CHANGE IN MS.  PT ON BIPAP
Medications:	No Sedation
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 6 Hz  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Some
sleep architecture was present and the EEG was mainly in sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
