History:	31 year old man with a history of TBI in 2012 and seizures.  Last seizure ~2 weeks
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is seen.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Alpha variant, fast
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute awake and drowsy EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
