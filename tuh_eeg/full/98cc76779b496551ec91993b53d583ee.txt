CLINICAL HISTORY:  75 year old man with diabetes, COPD, hypertension, CAD, CHF, on oxygen, presents with intermittent fluctuation in speech and cognition.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Famotidine, Plavix, Singulair, Coreg, Flonase
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient has continuous movement and multiple muscle electrode artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6-7 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded while awake.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild-to-moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
