REASON FOR STUDY:  Shaking episodes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old female with a feeling of weakness since that morning having right sided shaking today, which has been happening since April 12, but usually stops.  She today felt nauseous and went to get sick, lost consciousness, and started having a generalized tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.
Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
During drowsiness there is one single burst of what appears to be rhythmic mid temporal theta drowsiness seen on the left hemisphere.  This is slightly sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptic.
Seizures:  None.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
