CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old female with possible epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background is relatively
low voltage but there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm in a background rich in
beta frequency activity. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the record producing
an increase in amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness Include an increase
in beta. Mu rhythm is observed in wakefulness but testing is not performed to confirm
this. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this
record. If additional recording is needed, please do not hesitate to give us a call and we
can perform a sleep deprived or more prolonged EEG as well as arrange for cognitive
testing during the EEG.
