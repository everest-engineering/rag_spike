REASON FOR STUDY:  Forgetfulness and jittery.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 67-year-old woman with complaints of headache, jittery spells, forgetfulness for 9 months, recently worsening, and a history of a right MCA stroke, hypertension, asthma and bilateral hearing aids.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no more frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen independently at T4 and T3 (much more frequently in the right than the left) at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right more than left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. However, the right mid temporal focal slowing is consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
