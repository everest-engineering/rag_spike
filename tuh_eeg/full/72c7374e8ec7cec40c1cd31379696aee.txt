CLINICAL HISTORY:	24 year old  woman with sleep walking following an  MVA in
2004, evaluate for frontal lobe epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age.  There is a 10 Hz, 25 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
HR:	72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
