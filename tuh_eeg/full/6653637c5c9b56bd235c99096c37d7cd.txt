CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old woman with lupus and a left frontal stroke as well as bilateral encephalomalacia.  The patient with a change in behavior, possible seizure, possible stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lovenox, Plaquenil, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was confused and poorly cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat low and disorganized with a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but excess theta.  There are bursts of shifting frontal, somewhat irregular delta, a little bit more prominent on the left compared to the right.  Features of drowsiness include low rolling eye movements, but sleep is not sustained.
Heart rate 96 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Somewhat slow and disorganized pattern for an adult of this age.
Shifting frontal slowing, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves were identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow up study capturing one of her events with more prolonged sleep recording is suggested.
