DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well defined, 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm reaching 40-50 microvolts. The patient seems to be anxious with frequent eye blinks throughout the entire EEG. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is identical to a previous EEG in 2009 which was also normal. A single PVC was noted in the record which is not considered pathological.
