CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 52-year-old male with stroke 2 years ago, alcohol abuse, admitted with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  This patient had significant muscle artifact throughout the EEG, and had difficulty relaxing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a pattern of low-voltage beta and muscle.  Superimposed upon this, there is some sweat artifact, but there is also some rhythmic delta noted on the left.
Photic stimulation was unsuccessful.  Following photic stimulation, the patient starts to relax, drifts into stage 1 sleep with a dropout of the fast activity and left anterior temporal sharp waves was noted infrequently.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the 6th EEG for this individual and is similar to previous studies.  It demonstrates:
Low-voltage fast pattern in wakefulness.
Background slowing.
Rhythmic slowing in the left.
Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These features have been identified in previous study.  Of note, some studies have identified focal features in the right hemisphere.  No seizures were recorded.
