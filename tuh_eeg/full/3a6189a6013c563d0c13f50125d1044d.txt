History:
51 YO M WITH HX: SZ LAST SZ A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, GTC.
Medications:
Dilantin, Folic Acid
Sedation:
EEG Type:
Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:
International t0-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Waking background is characterized by a 20-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric beta activity is present Maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
Background activity is predominantly irregular6-7Hz theta activity during wakefulness. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Symmetric background slowing, Stepped photic stimulation from 1Â·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR is 50-55 bpm.
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with a toxic-metabolic or bilateral structural disturbance of uncertain etiology intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
