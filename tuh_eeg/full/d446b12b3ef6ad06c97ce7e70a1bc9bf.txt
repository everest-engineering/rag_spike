CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old male with seizures, underlying hemiatrophy.

MEDICATIONS: Allegra

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.
Hyperventilation produces some head rocking artifact and some rhythmic sign but no
definite focal features. In stage I sleep, vertex waves were identified. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were observed,
although there was some head rocking artifact. If epilepsy is an important consideration
repeat tracing and capturing sleep is recommended.
