CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old left handed male with seizures since he was 5 years old, with his last seizure in 2010.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient goes into stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures with hyperventilation produce a nicely well-formed diffuse high amplitude slowing and photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
