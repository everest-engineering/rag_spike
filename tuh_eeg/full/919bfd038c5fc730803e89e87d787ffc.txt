CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with history of traumatic brain injury in 1972, in coma for 3 months, now having daily spells with visual phenomenon 6-8 times per day for the last several days.  Past history of physical assault January 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, lisinopril, propranolol, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was uncomfortable during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is asleep with generous beta.  Vertex waves are noted, and there is a slight shifting asymmetry with the vertex waves.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with a well-formed 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient is awake, but briefly unresponsive to the technologist during the EEG, and then drifts off to sleep.  There are no definitive sharp waves or spikes, but there are some sharply contoured transient in the frontal region noted as she drifts off to sleep.
At the end of the record, the physician and the clinical team talked to the patient, but she is not interactive.  Later, she sits motionless as if she might be asleep, but the EEG demonstrates an awake pattern.
Heart rate:  75 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This electroencephalogram is remarkable for:
A hypersomnolent patient.
Generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features identified in this record.  This EEG suggests a patient who is quite sleepy but may also have a behavioral issue, in that she seems to be tuning out the outside individuals.
