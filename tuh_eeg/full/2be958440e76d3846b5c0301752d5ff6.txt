REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
A 65-year-old man with history of epilepsy secondary to alcohol withdrawal versus localization related and a past medical history of hypertension, chronic subdural hematoma now with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin, aspirin, Lovenox, Colace.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake in stage I sleep. Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Continuous focal slowing seen over the left hemispheres, maximum at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts. At times there are some sharply contoured activity over this hemisphere.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to continuous focal slowing over the left hemisphere, maximal in the anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction over the left hemispheres, maximum in the anterior temporal region which is consistent with his prior insult.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
