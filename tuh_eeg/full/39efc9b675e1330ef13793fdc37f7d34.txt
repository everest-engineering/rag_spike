STUDY DURATION:  26 minutes.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 52-year-old man with new onset of seizures occurring 3 weeks ago with 2 episodes of falling out of bed, shaking, loss of consciousness, tongue biting, and intermittent body jerks while at rest for years.  He also has a history of depression.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a mildly increased amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakeful and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.  At times there is frontally predominant on the left sharply contoured discharge which does not appear to be clearly pathologic.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
