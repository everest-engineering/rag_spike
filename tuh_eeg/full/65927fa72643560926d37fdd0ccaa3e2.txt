CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old gentleman with HIV and CNS cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis
MEDICATIONS: AZT, Combivir, Pyrimethamine, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat aphasic but awake and uses his left side quite purposely. He has intermittent jerking of the right leg.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates some variability.  There is an arrhythmic, mixed theta and delta pattern.  There is a periodic sharp wave identified from the left hemisphere, which demonstrates some variability, but is typically maximum in the left central or parietal region, occasionally in the occipital region. There are portions of the record where the activity is less prominent.  On some occasions, the clinical jerking of muscle groups on the right is not as prominent as the epileptiform activity.  In addition, in the sleep record, there are some portions of the record where the activity has slowed, but there is not a consistent pattern. At the close of this 24-hour portion, the periodic activity from the left central parietal region is not significantly changed.
HR:  72 BPM.
