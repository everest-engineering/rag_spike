History:	46 year old man with a history of seizures.  His current events are induced by stress.
His last event occurred out of sleep ~2-3 weeks ago.
Medications:	Tegretol,Insulin,Neurontin,Klonopin,Zoloft,Oxycodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles appear.  Left RMTD (rhythmic midtemporal
theta activity of drowsiness) and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
RMTD (rhythmic midtemporal theta activity of drowsiness)
POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
