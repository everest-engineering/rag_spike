CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old right handed woman with multiple sclerosis, stroke, asthma, now admitted with visual hallucinations and binocular double vision.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Solu-Medrol, ASA, Lovenox, Benadryl, Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy or in relaxed wakefulness, the alpha rhythm slows to 7 Hz.  There are intermittent bursts of generalized theta as well as some head rocking artifact as the patient becomes drowsy.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Intermittent, generalized slowing in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  The intermittent background slowing is a nonspecific finding which can be seen in metabolic encephalopathy or any other bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.
