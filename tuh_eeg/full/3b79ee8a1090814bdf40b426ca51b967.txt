CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old male with sudden right arm and leg weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, insulin, labetalol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Only photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz symmetric reactive posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, an asymmetry emerges with rhythmic mixed theta delta from the left frontocentral region.  Vertex waves and POSTS were seen in stage 1 sleep with rapid transitions in and out of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Heart rate 48-60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to intermittent, rhythmic slowing from the left frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.  These findings are congruent with this patient's structural abnormality noted on his MRI scan.
