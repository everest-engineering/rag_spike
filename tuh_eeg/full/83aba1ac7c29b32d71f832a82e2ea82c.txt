CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old woman with a stroke a year ago now with complex
partial seizures and left-sided weakness, COPD exacerbation, pacemaker, DVT,
strokes, TIA. Past history of epilepsy and memory impairment reported in 2009.
MEDICATIONS: ASA, Digoxin, Lisinopril, Plavix, Ambien, Spiriva, Xanax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively drowsy.
Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the patient continues to
demonstrate a fast alpha variant today of 14 Hz. She is very drowsy and drifts into stage
II sleep with vertex waves and spindles. There are minor asymmetries in the drowsy
pattern with a bit higher amplitude activity on the right when compared to the left.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling asleep but does elicit a driving
response.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for.
1. Fast alpha variant.
2. Somewhat higher amplitude activity in the left posterior region than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. The focal
slowing identified a year ago was not noted today. In that the patient seems to be
excessively drowsy, a followup EEG may be helpful.
