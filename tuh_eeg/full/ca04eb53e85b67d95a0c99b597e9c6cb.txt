History:	55 YR MALE PRESENTS WITH SZS. PT FREQUENT FLYER.  PMHX: SZ, DM, HTN
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN, TRILEPTAL INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Excess 18-25 Hz beta activity is present diffusely.  No normal sleep architecture was
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid and anterior temporal region.
Frequent sharp waves are present in the left anterior temporal region, with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F7/T3.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the left anterior
temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region,
and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization-
related epilepsy. In addition there is evidence of left temporal focal cerebral dysfunction and
diffuse cerebral dysfunction,  These findings are etiologically nonspecific.  No clinical or
