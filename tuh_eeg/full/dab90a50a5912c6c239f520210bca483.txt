CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old right handed woman with epilepsy.  Tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and drowsiness.  Also, staring spells.  Thyroid disease.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, thyroid.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is low voltage, but well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A low voltage EEG is a normal pattern.  No epileptiform features were noted.
