CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old male with multiple strokes now with change in mental status, episodes of staring, foaming at the mouth, and speech arrest.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Imdur, Norvasc, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a primarily drowsy record with a lower voltage, slow pattern.  The patient transitions in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Brief stimulation results in a brief arousal with a glimpse of a 7 Hz alpha rhythm, and then the patient drifts off into a sleep state.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving and a minimal arousal.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSIONS:  This EEG is remarkable for:
An excessively drowsy patient.
Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The background slowing is a nonspecific finding.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of use but additional evaluation for a cause for this patient's hypersomnolence is suggested.
