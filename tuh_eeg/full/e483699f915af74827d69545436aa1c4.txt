CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed male with refractory epilepsy and a cluster of tonic clonic seizures on May 2. Past history of frontal hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS: Amlodipine, Simvastatin, HCTZ, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. In the transition to drowsiness, there is rhythmic frontal delta with variable asymmetry, sometimes a little higher amplitude on the right or left frontal region a little bit more rhythmic and a little bit more prominent in the right frontocentral region. The transition to sleep includes vertex waves some of which are just to the right of the midline. Brief spindles are noted and then there is arousal. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 54 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Some asymmetries in rhythmic slowing and sleep morphologies, supportive of a structural pathology in the right central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features. The findings described above may be correlated with this patient's imaging. Focal slowing not as prominent as others studies. No sharp waves in either EEG.
