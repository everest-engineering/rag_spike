CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Remeron, Abilify, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient did not have any clinical seizures, but had an episode of nausea and associated relatively low blood pressure on the morning of the 13th.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In the transition in and out of drowsiness, there are 1 or 2 asynchronous bursts.
At approximately 11 a.m., the patient had an episode of tachycardia, measured with conventional telemetry, but the EKG lead on the EEG monitor was not functional at that time.
Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Sleep was a bit more consolidated, although the patient had frequent nocturnal arousals.  In an arousal, there are handful of bursts of shifting and slowing.
Interictal epileptiform detections:  None.
Electrographic seizures:  None.
Heart rate 78-140 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring during this section of the record was remarkable for:
No definitive epileptiform features.
No seizures.
An episode of tachycardia with relative hypotension and perhaps associated nausea.
