CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 21-year-old woman with an unknown early developmental history, depression, and posttraumatic stress syndrome.  The patient has been having an episode to right arm rotation and had a seizure with loss of consciousness and incontinence.  She continues to feel, as if she is experiencing myoclonic jerks.  I got interrupted and I did not do the history.

MEDICATIONS: Lorazepam, Remeron

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a bedside record without hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.

In wakefulness, there were bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic high amplitude 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.

No impairment of awareness was noted with the events.  The patient was able to answer questions even with very brief discharges, but again discharges are typically 1 to 1.5 seconds after going slow activity, lasting an another second at maximum duration.

The technologist notes 1 or 2 movements of the patient, but no definitive myoclonus was captured.

Heart rate 84 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike in wave activity occurring in brief bursts.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this young adult with unclear medical history and a 1st ever seizure and myoclonus, this EEG is most compatible with a inherited, generalized mechanism for epilepsy.
