CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 19-year-old woman with 2-year history of seizures, 2-5 minutes in duration, with generalized body shaking, eyes rolled back in head, loss of consciousness.  Previous seizure 1 week ago, hospitalized for those seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Previously treated with Adderall, none at present
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a routine 20-minute EEG, technically satisfactory with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms capturing wakefulness, drowsiness, hyperventilation, photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  At this time, previous EEGs are not available for comparison.  To more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, either comparison with previous studies or more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
