History:	53 year old man with a PMH of stroke (left) and ESRD on HD, now presents with a
single syncopal episode.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
During the maximal arousal the background consists of 7.5-8 Hz theta posteriorly with weak AP
gradient and excess diffuse theta activity.  There is frequent brief body/head jerks.  Patient's head is
slightly tilted towards the right throughout the recording.  During brief drowsiness, body jerks stops
and background is characterized by diffuse polymorphic fast theta activity.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere, especially over the left
frontotemporal region.  This activity, however, disappears during drowsiness (when the jerks stop).
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left hemispheric, especially frontotemporally
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Other, frequent head and body jerks
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
intermittent moderate left hemispheric (especially frontotemporal) focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild  diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  intermittent focal
slowing is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly
structural in origin.  However, because slowing is not seen during brief drowsiness, this finding could
be artifactual.  Please  correlate clinically and repeat EEG if needed.  Due to frequent brief
body/head jerks more subtle abnormalities or epileptiform discharges could have been missed.
