DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz, 40 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In wakefulness and in the transition to drowsiness there is occasional shifting slowing. Hyperventilation produces a small amount theta.

HR: 60 bpm
