EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Waking background is characterized by asymmetric (right > left) amplitude, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates with eye opening. Asymmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. maximal. bilateral
frontal regions with an Increased amplitude in the right During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. There Is an asymmetry of beta activity, with increased activity on the right
hemisphere. Both findings are consistent with a breach in the region. No epileptiform discharges are
present
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped
photic stimulation from 1Â·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
