CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old right handed woman with a single episode of leftsided
shaking.
MEDICATIONS: Micardis, Advair, isosorbide, HCTZ, Ecotrin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm
which is symmetric and reactive. There is a small amount of background beta and a
small amount of theta. Relaxed wakefulness is appropriately organized for an adult of
this age. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta. Hypersynchronous
rhythmic slowing is noted in the transition to sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving
response.
HR: 54 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If
additional evaluation is needed for this patient's right-sided shaking, a follow-up study
with more prolonged sleep is suggested.
