REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 82-year-old female presents with new onset left-sided weakness with a fall, with a past medical history of seizures, left posterior parietal left basal ganglia, mild dementia, GERD and urinary incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Plavix, Keppra, Lovenox, oxybutynin.
INTRODUCTION:  A route EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some continuous frontal muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  At times during stage I sleep the vertex waves become very rhythmic, but not clearly pathologic.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There appears to be a slight loss of faster frequencies over the left mid temporal region.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66 and regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous left mid  temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region which is consistent with the known result.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
