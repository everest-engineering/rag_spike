CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman with a past history of stroke, rare complex partial seizures with colorful characterization of complex partial seizures now with jerking of arms and face, involuntary jerking of right arm and face can be increased by stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  During the EEG, the patient has right face and hand stimulus sensitive jerking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is challenging.  There is generous beta noted throughout.  There is also a fair amount of movement and muscle artifact.  Periodic complexes are noted from the left hemisphere with where the pattern of periodic delta with a positive sharp at T1 in association with the patient's involuntary jerking.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Clinical jerking on the right associated more with the pattern of periodic delta and sharp-wave spikes, left posterior temporal.
Focal delta from the left hemisphere.
Background disorganization on the right.
Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most compatible with an epilepsy partialis continua pattern.  Based on this with EEG recording, long-term EEG monitoring was initiated.
