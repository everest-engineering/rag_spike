CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension, stroke, seizures, and an additional left stroke who presents with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tegretol, Lovenox, Gabapentin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Diovan, Carvedilol, Plavix, Aspirin, Protonix.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior, temporal, and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and obtundation were recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  Multiple electrode artifact.  Continuously filtering had to be used as the patient was very agitated during the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is best seen over the right hemisphere at 8.5 to 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some loss of the normal frontocentral beta.  The recording is only performed during wakefulness.  Activating procedures are performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves in the left hemisphere, maximum at F7/T3, seen very frequently at 2 to 4 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude.
Focal slow waves independently at F8/T4, seen occasionally.
Generalized slow waves of 5 to 7 Hz, seen continuously.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left hemispheric slowing, maximum in the temporal region.
Right anterior temporal slow waves.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left hemispheric structural dysfunction, maximally seen in the temporal lobe with loss of normal frequency over that region which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  There is also evidence of right anterior temporal focal dysfunction which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  Lastly, the EEG reveals diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is also nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
