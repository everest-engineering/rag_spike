CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 56-year-old woman with a syncopal episode, asthma, hypertension, schizophrenia, and past history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, Nexium, Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized, with primarily a theta frequency pattern.  Much of the record includes a drowsy state.  There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz alpha rhythm, and then the patient transitions to the somewhat slower pattern in drowsiness with some rolling eye movements and some slow vertex waves.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  To some extent, this patient's medications or neuropsychiatric history may contribute to the background slowing described above.
