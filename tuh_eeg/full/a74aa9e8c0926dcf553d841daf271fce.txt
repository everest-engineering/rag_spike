CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old female with CPS, LD, unsteadiness, frequent falling, dizziness and right facial twitching.  No facial twitching for a year but frequent syncope
MEDICATIONS:  LAMICTAL,VPA,PROZAC ZYPREXA
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This 24 minute EEG included orthostatic testing and ambulation.  Impedances were acceptable aside from T1-T2 electrodes.  There is a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact in this bedside EEG.  The patient had one “dropping” without LOC during the EEG
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the background EEG includes a generous amount of beta and theta in an awake pattern.  The initial heart rate was 72 BPM.  BP 96/53.
The patient was seated with a BP of 95/53.  With standing, heart rate increase to 120 BPM.  Additional BP was not recorded on the EEG while she was standing.
The patient was ambulating during the EEG and then her legs gave out and she  fell as they were attempting to put her back in bed but was supported, no  injury occurred.
She was returned to bed with a BP of 90/50.  Heart rate increased to 126 while standing but when she returned to bed, slowed to slowed to 84 bpm.  The patient was talking throughout.
IMPRESSION:  This awake 24 minute EEG was remarkable for:
A slow background with excess theta.
A baseline low blood pressure with an increase in heart rate from 72 bpm to 120 bpm with change in position.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slow pattern may be correlated with this patient's clinical history.  The changes in heart rate and the baseline low blood pressure may be evaluated in regard to orthostatic symptoms.
