CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old female with history of fibromyalgia and seizures described as grand mal, funny smells, shaking, clenched hands and teeth sometimes occurring in sleep and sometimes and aura and blanking out for minutes, last seizure 2 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Klonopin, Pristiq, Pamelor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep including REM.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep including REM.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and sometimes at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
EVENTS:  None captured or reported.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
