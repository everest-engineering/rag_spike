STUDY DATE:  December 8, 2011 to December 9, 2011 for 10 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old female with past medical history of sarcoidosis, peripheral neuropathy, gastroparesis, and gastritis, now with seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the recording there is a prolonged period of artifact lasting for 5 hours.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed for 10 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional single EKG electrode.  Continuous spike detections were used, in addition to patient's alarm and nurses notations.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Hyperventilation was performed at the end of the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9-10 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage I, II, and III.
Hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T1/-T3 at times more rhythmically than others.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent left anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
