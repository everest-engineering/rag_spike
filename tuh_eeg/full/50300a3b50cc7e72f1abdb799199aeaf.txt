CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old man with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, dementia, and seizures with multiple strokes who presents with right gaze preference.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Keppra, Insulin, Actos, Metformin, Aspirin, Lopressor, Prozac, Iressa.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive or obtunded.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low background with no posterior dominant rhythm and no frontocentral beta.  There appears to be asymmetry in between the right and the left hemispheres where on the left there seems to be some faster frequencies getting through in a theta to beta rhythm and in the right hemisphere there appears to be only delta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
Right hemisphere attenuation of faster frequencies.
Focal slowing of F7/T3 seen intermittently throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing as well as right hemisphere attenuation and left mid-temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction as well as mild left temporal dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regard to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of mild focal structural dysfunction in the right hemisphere which may be consistent with the previous strokes.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
