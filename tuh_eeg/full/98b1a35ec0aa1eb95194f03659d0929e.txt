CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 19-year-old woman, who awoke August 30th with generalized tonic-clonic seizure, patient has no recollection of event until she woke up in the emergency room.  She had a previous episode 2 months earlier with shaking.  History of pelvic pain.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins, Plan B, ibuprofen.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient appeared to be somewhat nervous and the technologist had trouble getting the patient to relax.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a great deal of beta activity as well as muscle.  There is a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves and spindles.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record, but the patient seemed to be very tense during photic stimulation.  No significant driving response was noted.
Heart rate 66-84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through sleep in an anxious adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be a value.
