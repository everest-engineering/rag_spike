CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old woman, 2 weeks status post massive frontal hemorrhage,
now seizure free but with poor mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Zofran, Tylenol, Gentamicin, Pantoprazole, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite somnolent. No clinical seizures are noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.
Much of the record includes an intra hemispheric asymmetry with a slower pattern on the left compared to the right. There are other portions, however, where there is more focal delta on the right compared to the left. There are sections of the record where a 6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is beginning to emerge from the right occipital region. Most of the features on the left include arrhythmic delta or semirhythmic delta, some of which is sharply contoured in the left hemisphere. There are rare sharp waves noted from the left frontal region. Occasional more rhythmic slowing is noted from the right with rare right centrotemporal sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Slowing which can be identified from either hemisphere which can be quite sustained.
2. Rare sharp waves Including right centrotemporal and left frontal
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overall background is markedly improved. This EEG is
supportive of a bihemispheric disturbance. The pattern is somewhat unusual and interesting, but the correlation with imaging may be helpful in terms of the appearance or epileptiform activity which was previously right frontal when the patient had massive left-to-right herniation and is now more of a right centrotemporal focus.
