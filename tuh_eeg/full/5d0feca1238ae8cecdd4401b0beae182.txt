CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old right handed woman who had tonic clonic seizures. The seizures began as staring spells, incontinence and post ictal confusion. This is a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. The patient is awake and drowsy within the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The reading is well organized. This is a 1-hour sleep deprivation EEG. The background is organized, normal amplitude with a alpha rhythm of 10 Hertz. During stage 2 sleep the patient achieves vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and posts. During photic stimulation there was symmetric driving as apposed to the earlier EEG which was asymmetric. Hyperventilation produced background slowing.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is no epileptiform activity seen in this study.
