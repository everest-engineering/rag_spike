CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old gentleman status post acoustic neuroma resection, June 2014.  The patient treated briefly with Keppra, which was resumed after the patient had a recurrent seizure.  Episode in 2015 with seizure characterized by impairment of awareness.  Chronic left headache, left facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.5-9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  A clear breach rhythm was noted from the left with higher amplitude alpha on the left in comparison to the right.  There is prominent muscle artifact noted in the left frontal temporal electrodes with fast activity of approximately 35 hertz.  As the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing is identified in the left mid temporal region.  The patient does not sustain deeper stages of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
intermittent focal slowing noted in drowsiness from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm identified above is an anticipated finding following craniotomy and is congruent with the previous left cranial surgery.  There is prominent 35 hertz fast activity noted in the left temporalis/ scalp over congruent with the patient's clinical symptoms and he has complaint of an ongoing muscle spasm in that area.  (Muscle artifact)
This is the 3rd EEG for this individual.  It demonstrates significant improvement in comparison to the immediate postoperative study in June 2014.
No epileptiform features were noted in the last two EEGS.
