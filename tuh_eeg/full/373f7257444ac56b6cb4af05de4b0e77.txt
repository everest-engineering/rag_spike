CLINICAL HISTORY:   70 year old right handed male with epilepsy, confusion, hallucinations, history of syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Hydralazine, Isosorbide
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with primarily arrhythmic theta frequency background. There is a bit more arrhythmic theta on the right compared to the left and bit more arrhythmic delta activity on the left. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing with primarily arrhythmic theta slow pattern.
Subtle slowing on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to previous study in 2010, the background today is somewhat slower. There were no left temporal sharp waves noted, there was a little bit more slowing on the left compared to the right.
