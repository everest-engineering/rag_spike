CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 67-year-old male with dementia, rapidly progressive, and history of seizures, as well as depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was somnolent throughout.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of theta delta.  Superimposed upon this are occasional triphasic waves.  There are also some additional sharp waves, particularly in the frontal regions, left greater than right, which may be blunted sharp waves.  In addition, there are additional sharp waves and rare spikes, with variable phase reversals including right frontal, right mid temporal, and left frontal.
Rare twitching was noted by the patient, but was not associated with epileptiform activity.
Slow, spontaneous movements were noted by the patient, including elevation of the right arm, not associated with epileptiform features.
Heart rate 72 BP, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
Triphasic waves.
Sporadic sharp waves noted in the record from the right or left hemisphere including frontal or temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The behaviors recorded in the record were not seizures, but this is a markedly abnormal EEG.  If seizures are an important consideration, additional recording may be of value.
