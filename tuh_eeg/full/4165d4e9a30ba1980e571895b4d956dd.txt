CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old right-handed woman who recalls 6 seizures in the last 24 hours.  She has some awareness of the first 2, but not the others. Past history of memory lapse and a motor vehicle accident 1 year ago.  The patient also reports a diagnosis of a tumor in the posterior head 15 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol, Xanax, Percocet, Topamax, Ambien, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, diffuse beta.  The patient frequently transitions from wakefulness to drowsiness and into stage 2 sleep.  Much of the record is a sleep record with generous beta.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:  Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generous beta can be seen in the context of benzodiazepine use.  No epileptiform features were noted.
