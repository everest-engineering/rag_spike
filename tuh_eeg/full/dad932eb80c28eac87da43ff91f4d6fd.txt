HISTORY: 85 year old male with right-sided shaking, right-sided drooling,
and lower lip twisting. This event occurred on the 28th and lasted 2 minutes.
Sinemet, Namenda, Remeron, Lisinopril, Flomax; Advair, Duoneb,
Spiriva
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is awake and confused.
OF THE RECORD: This bedside record is somewhat challenged by
muscle artifact, but there is a well-defined 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of
beta and theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic theta.
HR: 90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow-up study in the lab capturing sleep is suggested.
