CLINICAL HISTORY:   35 year old female status post code for 10 minutes associated with high fever.  She has a history of HIV, sickle cell, acute chest, splenic infarct, hypertension, depression, and shingles.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dopamine, Phenylephrine, Cefepime, Metronidazole, Acyclovir,Norepinephrine, Pantoprazole, Dobutamine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  During the recording, the patient was stimulated with ocular stimulation and there appears to be some change in the frequencies to faster and increased muscle artifact consistent with reactivity in the EEG.  In addition, there is intermittent generalized periodic discharges seen with an anterior dominance and a frequency of 0.5 Hz, not seen throughout the whole recording but fairly frequently.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized periodic discharges with a maximal central and frontal predominance of 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz seen throughout the recording.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Generalized periodic discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology but may be seen in hypoxic injury or generalized metabolic dysfunction.  No seizures were seen.  The reactivity in the EEG is suggestive of a good prognosis.
