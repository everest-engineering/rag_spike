History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON 78 YR MALE WITH RIGHT SDH/EVACUATION/SHIFT. WITH
POSSIBLE SZ POST SURGERY.  FALL WITH SDH.  PT DENIES ANY SZS.
Medications:	Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which is best seen over the
left hemisphere.  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over left frontal regions. The frontal
beta is attenuated over the right hemisphere.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximally seen
independently over the frontal and posterior temporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, maximal frontal and posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep  42 minute EEG because of continuous focal
slowing in the left hemisphere maximally seen independently over the frontal and posterior
temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion and consistent with the
known SDH.  No seizures were seen.
