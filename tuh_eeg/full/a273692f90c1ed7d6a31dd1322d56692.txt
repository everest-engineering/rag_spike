CLINICAL HISTORY: A 55-year-old male status post dosed a head Injury many years ago. The patient was admitted with phenytoin toxicity and persistent at ataxia.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Tegretol, Trileptal
Introduction: digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred. The patient was relatively drowsy. This Is a technically acceptable routine bedside EEG aside from T1-T2 Impedances which ware slightly greater than 5 kilohms. EEG captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
OF THE In wakefulness, there Is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm noted.
Shifting slowing was noted from either temporal region. As the patient became drowsy, there is a bit more slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal region. In addition, the patient fluctuates In and out of sleep, !he alpha is a bit more vigorous on !he left.
Heart rate: 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This bedside portable routine 20 minute EEG Is remarkable for:
1. Shifting slowing from the temporal regions.
2. An Intermittent asymmetry as the patient merges to or from sleep with slowing in the right occipital region or disruption of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This Is the second EEG for individual which did not identify epileptiform activity. The picture today Is a bit more bilateral with perhaps more local slowing on the right compared to the left. These findings may be related with Imaging.
