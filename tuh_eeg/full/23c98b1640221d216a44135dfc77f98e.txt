HISTORY:  73 year old right handed male with history of a fall as well as diabetes, hypertension and seizures who presents with fall.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Lovenox, Metformin, Dilantin, Aricept, Pravachol.
REASON FOR EEG:  History of seizures and fall.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep, stage I, were recorded.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous F3 electrode artifact could not be fixed during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Sleep architecture is seen with some vertex waves in stage I.  Photic stimulation presents no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow-waves seen at F8/T4, seen frequently with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Generalized slow-waves seen at a frequency of 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal focal slow waves.
Mild generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals no evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
