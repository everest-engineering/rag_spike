INTRODUCTION:
NOTE
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior
temporal electrodes. Sleep and wakefulness were recorded. Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None.
MEDICATIONS:
dilantin and Depakote.
HISTORY:
An 80-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia and bed bound for years presents with a history of epilepsy and a recent seizure.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to a slow background mainly in the theta frequencies with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best,
reaches 7Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts. There is minimal frontal central beta seen. Stage changes are
noticed and some vertex waves are noted signifies stage I sleep, Photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz and 20 to 50 microvolts amplitude.
2. Bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to mild diffuse slow waves and FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
