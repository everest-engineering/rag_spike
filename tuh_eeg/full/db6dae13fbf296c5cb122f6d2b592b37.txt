VPA GBP
SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.0 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. In addition, there is some slower Alpha on the right- 7.8 to 8.3 Hz
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
Subtle focal slowing is present; characterized by slower alpha and theta frequency in the right posterior quadrant
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG.
1. Subtle R posterior focal features
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The focal slowing is in the region of some of the prior CVAS. This is the second EEG without sharp waves or spikes. This	EEG
does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. It is much improved compared to the ICU record 10/21/2015
