suprastomal wound.
Medications:	Heparin, ASA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 7-8Hz for a short period of time.  Background activity
was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  At times some central beta can be seen.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.  State changes were noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to verbal
and  tactile stimuli.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and slowing of alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
