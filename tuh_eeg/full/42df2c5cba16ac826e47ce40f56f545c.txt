CLINICAL HISTORY:  6-feet 2-inch, 159-pound 16-year-old with positional light-headedness, dizziness, and tunnel vision.  Symptoms predate concussion in October.  Past history of palpitations.
MEDICATIONS:  none
INTRODUCTION:  26-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances below 5 kOhms with the exception of T1, T2 electrodes.  Patient had routine hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  At the end of photic stimulation, after sitting for 20 minutes, the patient was asked to stand and then hyperventilation was repeated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Stage 2 sleep included vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.
Hyperventilation was performed twice, both times producing rhythmic high-amplitude paroxysmal frontally predominant theta and delta.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
EKG: Standing after sitting for 20 minutes produced a dramatic change in heart rate from 60 beats per minute to 96 beats per minute.  Blood pressure was not checked.  The patient was subsequently able to hyperventilate while standing, and at the close of the record, when the patient sat back down the heart rate returned to 66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted, but there was a significant change in heart rate with simple standing from a seated position after 20 minutes of sitting.  These findings may be correlated clinically.
