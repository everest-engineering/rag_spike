History:	41 YEAR OLD MALE PRESENTING WITH HEADACHE AND STATES HE HAS
STARING SPELLS.  DX: ENCEPHALITIS IN 2006 WITH SURGERY FOR A SHUNT
PLACEMENT ON THE RIGHT.
Medications:	Amitriptyline. Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region (F7/T3) during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR IS 60.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
