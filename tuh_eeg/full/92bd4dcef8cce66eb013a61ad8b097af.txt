CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with history of left PCA stroke and bradycardia admitted with right-sided numbness and headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Protonix, ASA, Lovenox, Zocor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Right sided numbness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while in wakefulness and in stage I sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal and central beta. Activating procedures, which included photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen at T3 frequently and occasionally at T4 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.
SEIZURES  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral midtemporal focal slow waves [left more then right].
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.
