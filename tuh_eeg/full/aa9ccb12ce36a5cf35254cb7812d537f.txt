CLINICAL HISTORY:   95 year old male with stomach pain, dizziness, jitteriness, colon cancer. The patient had an episode of shaking of the hand with incontinence and tongue biting.  Dalmane and Ativan withdraw.
MEDICATIONS:  Temazepam, Sertraline, Ativan, Remeron, Norvasc, HCTZ
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is tremulous throughout the EEG with rhythmic 3-4 hertz activity. In the brief sections were the patient's jitteriness resolves, the overall background is one of beta and 2-3 hertz delta. Review of the video demonstrates not so much movement, but he does have titubation of the head and that likely accentuates the amount of EEG artifact. In addition, during the a section of the record where the patient is not moving, he has a section with higher amplitude left central sharp waves. There is also another section with a great deal of artifact and asymmetry with more rhythmic almost vertex like waves on the right rather than the left. This was an extremely technically challenging study.
HR:    78 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a beta pattern with smaller amounts of delta.
In some sections of the record with the potential for epileptiform activity in the central regions which differ from the EKG artifact. This was seen independently from the right and left, but with a prominent burst on the left
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is congruent with encephalopathy but with sharp waves and paroxysmal behavioral changes consider LTM video EEG.
