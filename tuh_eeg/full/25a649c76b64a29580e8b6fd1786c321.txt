CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed woman with history of seizures described as an aura of a feeling in the stomach followed by bilateral twitching of her upper extremities and tonic-clonic activity, confused for some time, last seizure on January 25, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  This pattern is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  Those are including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent left anterior temporal slow waves which at time have a sharp contour, but not clear epileptiform.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
