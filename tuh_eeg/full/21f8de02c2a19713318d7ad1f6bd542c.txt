CLINICAL HISTORY:  refractory CPS for presurgical evaluation: 3 CPS per month
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, carbamazepine, others.
INTRODUCTION:  This is the second day of continuous video EEG monitoring using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG, and seizure and spike detection software.  During this 24-hour section of the record, there were no clinical seizures and no electrographic seizures noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
Background:  In the wake and sleep background, there is rare, attenuation of faster frequency activity which can be seen in the right or left temporal region.
Interictal epileptiform activity:  There were rare, subtle right temporal sharp waves maximum at T2 noted in drowsiness.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this section of the record was remarkable for a patient who is quite drowsy during the day with frequent transitions between wakefulness and sleep, but no seizures.
