CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed woman with a stroke, admitted with aphasia characterized by word finding difficulties.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Percocet, ASA, Amlodipine, Plavix, Lorazepam, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal. The overall background is excessively slow and superimposed upon a background that is primarily theta with smaller amounts of delta and beta. There is an asymmetry with additional focal slowing, and disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere compared to the right. In addition, there are intermittent bursts of periodic slowing in the left anterior temporal region. Features of drowsiness including increased in beta with vertex waves, spindles and as the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep. There are also a handful of left anterior temporal sharp waves which emerge as she transitions into stage 2 sleep.
HR:    70 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG.
Focal slowing in the left hemisphere particularly left anterior temporal region characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity as well as the appearance of slowing.
Periodic slowing in the left anterior temporal region.
There are left anterior temporal sharp waves as the patient transitions to sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the left, one that is potentially epileptiform.
