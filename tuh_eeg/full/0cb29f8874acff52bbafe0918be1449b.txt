REASON FOR STUDY: Seizures.
INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal lead and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy. Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
HISTORY: A 27-year-old man with a history of fall from a roof in 2010 with multiple injuries including fractured face, leg with seizures described as tonic/clonic activity, tongue biting, episodes of confusion as well as headache, last seizure one week ago.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta. Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate: 78.
Abnormal Discharges:
1. Focal slow waves seen in the frontal regions bilaterally slightly more prominent on the left than the right. At times more prominent at TP2 and at time more prominent at F3 and at times also seen at F4 and C4.
2. Sharp waves seen bifrontally mainly at FP1 and F7, but at times also at F4 and T4. Some of the sharp waves have an atypical field and appeared to be poly spiky.
Seizures: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to bilateral frontal and anterior temporal slowing as well as intermittent frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in the bilateral frontal regions which may be consistent with the known injury. No seizures were seen.
