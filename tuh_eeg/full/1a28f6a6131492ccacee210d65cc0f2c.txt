AGE: 56 y.o.
SEX: male
START DATE OF STUDY: 11/27/2015 at 10:22AM
END DATE OF STUDY: 11/28/2015 at 11:00AM
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 24 hours, video LTM EEG #: LTM 15-335
HISTORY:
56 y.o. male with a history of left basal ganglia hemorrhage and change in mental status referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
pantoprazole (PROTONIX) 40 mg tablet, 1 tablet daily
No current facility-administered medications for this visit. SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG.
Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as well as extensive random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed.
DAY 1 (11/27/2015, 10:22AM - 11/28/2015, 06:00) BACKGROUND:
. The waking background is continuous, asymmetric, with subtle
amplitude suppression over the left hemisphere.	There were persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency. Overall there is diffuse background slowing seen (theta and delta predominantly) . The frontal delta component often exhibits a triphasic morphology.
Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.
The background is non-reactive, and highly variable . Sleep was not captured.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
EVENTS: At 12:18PM, the patient exhibited leftward eye deviation. There was no change in background cerebral activity. No other clinical or electrographic events reported or detected
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Diffuse slowing, and no clinical or electrographic seizures seen.
A single episode of leftward eye deviation was not associated with a change in cerebral activity.
DAY 2 (11/28/2015, 06:00 - 11/28/2015, 11:00)
BACKGROUND : No change GENERALIZED SLOWING : No change
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS : No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single EKG lead captured normal sinus rhythm.
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Diffuse slowing, and no clinical or electrographic seizures seen.
