CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with a sharp pain in the back of her head for the past month.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well organized with a 10 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation produces scant background slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
