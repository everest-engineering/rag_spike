CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with Turner's syndrome and adult-onset epilepsy for the past 5 years.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In hyperventilation and in drowsiness, there are some occasional paroxysmal bursts of mixed alpha-theta frequency activity with a slight asymmetry.  Some of these are extremely brief, less than half a second in duration.  There is a small amount of shifting slowing noted both during hyperventilation and in drowsiness.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very minimally abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to scant shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal adult may have paroxysmal higher amplitude alpha or theta frequency activity in drowsiness or hyperventilation.  There is a slight asymmetry at times with this activity.  The shifting arrhythmic delta activity would be considered mildly abnormal for an adult of this age.
This is the fifth EEG for this adult.  No frontal sharp waves or temporal sharp waves were noted.  The overall background is similar to previous studies and is better organized than her first EEG in 2007.
In the past, she had frontal spike and slow-wave activity with some of the paroxysmal activity which was not noted today.
