CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old right handed male with a history of seizures since age 8, now with staring episodes followed by tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Zonisamide
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video  EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation accentuates some temporal slowing as described below and photic stimulation produces a nice photic driving, but no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F8/T4 more than F7/T3, at times very sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptiform, although some waveforms are suspicious, especially on the right.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral anterior temporal slowing, right more than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
