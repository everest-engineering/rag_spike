EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also
seen.  Mild diffuse excess beta activity is present.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces strong symmetric photic driving response.  HR was 66.
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. No epileptiform discharges are present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  Excess beta activity is a nonspecific finding and may be a result of
