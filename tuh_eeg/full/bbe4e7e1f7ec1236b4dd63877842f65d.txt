History:	55 YO FEMALE PRESENTS WITH HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (DNR)
TREATMENT.
PMHX: ETOH (DAILY), HYPOTHYROIDISM, HEMORRHOIDS, HTN.
Medications:	OXACILLIN, FLUCONAZOLE, OCTREOTIDE, MIDODRINE, KAYEXALATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 60 but there were difficulties
with the EKG.
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
