History:	66 YO MALE AVR ROOT REPLACEMENT
Medications:	INDUCTION MEDS: VERSED FENTANYL ROCURONIUM ETOMIDATE LIDOCAINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions. During the procedure the EEG slowing progressed to reveal a diffuse theta
and later delta activity with burst suppression. At one point the EEG was transiently  isoelectric with
cooling. The patient had cardiac and circulatory arrest. The EEG was in burst suppression but not
not completely isoelectric at the time and the team was informed.  INCISION: 9:19 - SUBCLAVIAN ,
10:15 - CHEST, HEPARIN: 5000/9:41 25000/10:37, COOLING: HEAD- 10:50,  BODY- 10:46
CIRRC. ARREST: 11:39, CARDIAC ARREST: 10:46, HEAD/BODY WARM: 12:01
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG during a 6 hour aortic surgery.
