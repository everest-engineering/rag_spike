SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG- this is an intubated, comatose patient.	There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is symmetric, low-voltage, featureless with scant low-voltage beta.	Slow, sweat or slow delta activity is noted, compatible with artifact.	There is no reactivity or variability.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
Arc of the abnormal bedside portable EEG due to:
1. marked paucity of any cerebral activity CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is study supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.
He demonstrates a pattern of ongoing attenuation in comparison to previous studies 3 days ago
