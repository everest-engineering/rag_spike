CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old male with left upper extremity weakness and numbness and right frontal temporal infarct with a history of CAD, hypertension, CKD, and right carotid occlusion.
MEDICATIONS: Versed, Fentanyl, Propofol, Lidocaine, Etomidate.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Right carotid endarterectomy.
INTRODUCTION:  EEG was performed during a right carotid endarterectomy using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded throughout the procedure and changes were communicated to the team.  The patient was clamped at 38 minutes into the procedure and unclamped at 1 hour and 32 minutes into the procedure.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  During the baseline, there is normal frontal central beta.  No sleep is captured. Throughout the recording, the patient continues to have a normal amount of beta activity and at 10:47 a.m. the patient's internal, external carotid are clamped.  There appears to be no change in the EEG background and this was reported to the team.  About 11:42 a.m. the patient is unclamped and there is, again, no change in the background.
IMPRESSION:  Uneventful right carotid endarterectomy electroencephalogram monitoring.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no changes during this right carotid endarterectomy.
