CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed woman with a long history of epilepsy with 5 types of seizures, history of multiple seizure related injuries.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Carbamazepine, Furosemide, Lamotrigine, Benicar, Metoprolol, Meclizine, Isosorbide, Metolazone, Plavix

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation only.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hertz alpha rhythm with excess 4-5 Hertz activity noted in the background and frequent eye blink. Sleep is not achieved. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.

HR: 60 bpm with occasional ectopy.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Previous EEGs for this patient identified left temporal sharp waves. These were not identified today. There was a bit more theta noted in the background in this study compared to the 2007 EEG. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. Not every EEG identifies epileptiform activity. If the patient has frequent seizures, EEG monitoring may be considered to capture events. This was previously recommended in 2007 but the patient declined that evaluation.
