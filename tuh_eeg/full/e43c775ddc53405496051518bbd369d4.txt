CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman admitted to the hospital on the 9th after a hypotensive spell. She had a tonic clonic seizure on the 11th lasting 30 seconds.

MEDICATIONS: Meropenem, Doxycycline, Norepinephrine, Tylenol Heparin, Pantoprazole, Meropenem,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated in the ICU.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates the pattern of relatively symmetric, diffuse rhythmic mixed theta and delta with 2.4 Hertz delta and 6.8 Hertz theta. There is a slight asymmetry with a lower amplitude pattern on the right compared to the left. This phenomenon is seen intermittently in the record.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. A slight asymmetry in amplitude.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The amplitude asymmetry is of unclear clinical significance. If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat tracing when she leaves the ICU may be of value.
