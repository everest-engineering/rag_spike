REASON FOR STUDY:  Refractory epilepsy.
STUDY DATE:  10/08/2012 to 10/12/2012, for a total of 4 days (24 hours each)
CLINICAL HISTORY:  She is a 23-year-old woman with refractory epilepsy since age 6, now with recent recurrent attacks, here for seizure classification and possible presurgical evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra was tapered off after day one.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software in addition to patient events and nurses' notes were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Events or seizures:  None reported.  No push-buttons were noted in this 4 day study
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep LTM EEG.  No events were captured.
