CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old nursing home resident with history of intracerebral hemorrhage, craniotomy, posttraumatic epilepsy, and dementia.  The patient was found on the floor a week ago and now has increasing weakness on the left arm and right leg.



MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, phenytoin, Klonopin, topiramate, Risperdal, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was unable to cooperate with hyperventilation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is relatively somnolent.  The background EEG was diffusely slow, lacking in the normal wave forms anticipated for an awake adult.  It is relatively lower voltage featureless on the left and there is a bit more theta noted on the right.  The patient was awake during portions of the testing, and he was tested for alertness.  There is a craniotomy defect but a suggestion of perhaps sharp wave at T6.  Features of sleep included an increase in beta.

Photic stimulation did not activate the record.

Heart rate 60 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. An asymmetry with a more attenuated record on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is the 5th EEG for this individual.  It is slower than previous studies.  Correlation with clinical history is suggested.
