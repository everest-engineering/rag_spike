History: 70 year old woman with altered mental status.
Medications: Propofol off since 1111/2013; aspirin, acyclovir, others
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique: International 10.20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present Background activity is characterized by a mixture of polymorphic delta and theta activity, background discontinuity and absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture is present.
Intermittent paucity of faster frequencies and minimal voltage attenuation are noted the left anterior quadrant No indicator electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was clear reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli, characterized by Increase in diffuse theta activity and improvement in the background discontinuity. Persistent tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, moderate. Left anterior
Attenuation, mild, left anterior
No electrographic seizures
This Is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse background that is more pronounced over the left anterior quadrant Diffuse slowing is Indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Continuous focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
