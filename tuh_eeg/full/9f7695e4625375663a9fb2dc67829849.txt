History:	81 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SZ WITNESSED BY GRANDDAUGHTER.  PMHX:  SZ,
HTN, DM, CVA, CHF, BRADYCARDIC, PERIPHERAL EDEMA.
Medications:	ASA, INSULIN, PROTONIX, LISINOPRIL, ZONISAMIDE, ISOSORBIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the F8/T4 region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 72 with frequent PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
more than the right frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, and are etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
