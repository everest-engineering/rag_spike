History:	71 YEAR OLD FEMALE R HANDED PMHX HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. NOW WITH
LOC IN MONTH 7X NO REASON NO DIZZINESS JUST FEELS CONFUSED
AFTERWARDS.NO INCONTINENCE NO TONGUE BITING .
Medications:	Pt does not know
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
Occasional  polymorphic theta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. occasional focal slowing in the right temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
