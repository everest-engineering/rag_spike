CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with previous left occipital stroke as well as bilateral chronic strokes.  Patient admitted on the 14th with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan 4 mg, metoprolol, Depakote, lisinopril, Complera, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  22-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was somnolent throughout the EEG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  The patient was not substantially stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is markedly abnormal and demonstrates the absence of normal waveforms for wakefulness or sleep.  The overall pattern includes a marked asymmetry with a low voltage, featureless mixed theta delta pattern on the right, and continuous epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere.  Using a referential montage, this activity is maximum in the left frontocentral region with variability including F3, FP1 and they spread to the posterior regions, again it is quite variable.  The activity is periodic with the appearance of faster frequency activity.  At slow paper speed in with a referential montage, this is a clear waxing and waning pattern with at times attenuations and a suppression of the activity for 800 milliseconds followed by recurrent repetitive epileptiform activity.
Vigorous stimulation was not performed, but there are infrequent arousals at which point the epileptiform activity decreases briefly.
Heart rate 90 BMP.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG and is compatible with status epilepticus due to,
Repetitive epileptiform activity, which demonstrates frequency evolution, maximum left frontotemporal region.
Left frontal sharp waves.
Marked background slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were identified by the clinical team and the patient was placed on long-term monitoring.
