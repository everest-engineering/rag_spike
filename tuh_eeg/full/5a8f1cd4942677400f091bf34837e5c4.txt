CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old right handed female with past medical history of epilepsy, has been seizure free for the past 7 years. This is a follow-up EEG.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 9-Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation produced supraharmonic driving. When the patient closed her eyes, she had some alpha squeaks. There was a single burst of 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity, mostly located frontally predominantly. Patient also demonstrated POSTS in stage 2 sleep.

HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an abnormal EEG which supports an underlying generalized mechanism of epilepsy.
