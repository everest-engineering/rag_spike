LENGTH OF PROCEDURE:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 31-year-old woman who presents with a history of generalized tonic/clonic convulsions associated with tongue biting and post-ictal confusion.  The last such event was on 1/7/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well-formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Hyperventilation was performed with fair effort and does not produce significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in occipital driving.  During sleep a burst of diffuse theta and delta activity, as well as symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22-minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
