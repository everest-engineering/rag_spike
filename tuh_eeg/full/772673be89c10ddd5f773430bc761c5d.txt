History: 24 year old woman with a history of seizures since 15 yo, now seizure-free for several years. Seizures are described as shakiness without loss of consciousness.
Medications: Zonegram
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-4 0uV, 1OHz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
Diffuse low-to-moderate amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but could be related to
excessive drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present. but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If
clinically indicated. repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy
