History:	68 YO FEMALE PRESENTS W / EMS, NAUSEA, VOMITING, DIARRHEA AND
AMS.  ON 5/1 PT E/V/D  W/ AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS.
PMHX: SZ DISORDER, PRES, HTN, DM2
Medications:	CEFTRIAXONE, VANCOMYCIN, MIDAZOLAM, LORAZEPAM, AMPICILLIN IN ED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess diffuse 6-7 Hz theta activity during
wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  Intermittent rhythmic diffuse 2-4 Hz delta activity is present during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, Slow PDR
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
posterior dominant rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
