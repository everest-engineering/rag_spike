CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old left handed male with epilepsy, mental retardation admitted today with status epilepticus. Last evaluation for epilepsy 10/28/2010, for episodic incontinence. Seizures characterized by incontinence, gazing to the left, twitching and contraction of the arms, history of anoxic brain injury and hepatitis-C.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tegretol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, relatively featureless pattern. There is theta frequency activity and smaller amounts of beta activity. This very low voltage record is a little more featureless in the right hemisphere compared to the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity. There is some spontaneous eye movement artifact. The patient is examined during the EEG which does little to activate the record. This very low voltage record also includes a bit of shifting arrhythmic delta activity and despite some artifact and some shifting slowing in the right frontocentral region.
HR: 66 to 72 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Low voltage pattern with a mixture of beta, theta and some delta
2. Shifting asymmetries with an amplitude asymmetry with somewhat higher amplitude activity on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, this is similar to a previous study from the prior year with a low voltage pattern and theta. The asymmetries described above are of unclear clinical significance in this critical care bedside recording and additional evaluation may be helpful to more completely evaluate epileptiform activity.
