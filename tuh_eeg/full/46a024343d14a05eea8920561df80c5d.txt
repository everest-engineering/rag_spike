HISTORY: 42-year-old right-handed gentleman with a handful of seizures over the course of his life.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode place Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha- low voltage, frontal central beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increasing beta with so- Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving despite the fact that the patient is falling asleep
Hyperventilation produces head rocking artifact, but there is a very subtle asymmetry and a- an asymmetry in terms of the amplitude on the left compared to the right. Brief stage II sleep complexes, spindles, and POSTS
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This is a very minimally abnormal EEG due to a slightly asymmetric hyperventilation response right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. Of note, this is the patients fourth EEG. The very first seizure also demonstrated subtle slowing on the right.
