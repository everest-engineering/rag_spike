CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 37-year-old woman with epilepsy since 12 months of life, seizures began with negative aura, followed by loss of consciousness, and then confusion.  Seizures at least monthly.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was requested.  A 42 minute EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient required lorazepam prior to the EEG.  This EEG captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-defined alpha rhythm.  This is 9.7 hertz, 30 microvolts.  Abundant diffuse beta activity was noted.  There are rare subtle asymmetries noted in the record with rare, subtle slowing in the left hemisphere and a single left temporal sharp waves.
Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and a slight accentuation of the focal features in the left hemisphere.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Hyperventilation increases the amplitude of the background.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was somewhat limited by the patient cooperation, but is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Subtle slowing from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The focal slowing may be correlated with imaging and history;
Of note  there was only a single sharp wave, this is of unclear clinical significance.
This patient was unable to fully cooperate with testing.  She was utilizing her cell phone during the EEG, which may have precluded our ability to capture the intended 60 minutes and as well as deeper stages of sleep.
