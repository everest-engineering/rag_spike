CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory left temporal epilepsy with recent increase in seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedance was satisfactory and the patient had tense jaw muscle activity throughout the EEG.  This was only on the right side.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was 7 Hz alpha rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not activate the record.  Heart rate is 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves were identified today.  The previous EEGs are not available for comparison, and it is not known if the background is a slower today than the previous EEGs.
