History:	50 YR MALE WITH PMHX TBI/ SZS. WITH INCREASE IN HEADACHES AND
AURAS.  PT HAS DIARY OF AURAS SEE CHART)
Medications:	Carbatrol, Lacosamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild excessive theta during wakefulness,  These
finding is a etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
