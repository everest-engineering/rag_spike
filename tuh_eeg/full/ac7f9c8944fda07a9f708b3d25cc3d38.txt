CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with focal seizures, right-sided subdural hematoma, left-sided stroke, ongoing confusion and difficulty speaking.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, insulin, Clindamycin, Lovenox, Atenolol, Metformin, Lisinopril, Advair, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively low to medium pattern with generous beta, arrhythmic delta activity and somewhat periodic sharp waves are noted from the left hemisphere with a periodic sharp complex which is relatively slow In nature and can be seen approximately every 5 seconds. The patient is awake but confused. Features of drowsiness include more rhythmic delta from the left hemisphere and some bilateral spindle activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Toward the close of the record with photic stimulation the periodic sharp waves are a bit more prominent and may be seen as often as every 5 seconds.

HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
3. Occasional left sided periodic sharp waves.
CORRELATION: In comparison to the previous EEG, this study is significantly improved. Although there are some periodic sharp waves, they are certainly not so prominent. No seizures were record. This EEG is more compatible with a late or postictal pattern.
