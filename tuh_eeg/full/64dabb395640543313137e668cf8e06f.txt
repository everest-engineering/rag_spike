History:	59 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. PT WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL ON 12-2014
W A SZ. AND WAS NOTED TO HAVE A MENINGIOMA CT SCAN NOTED
MULTI NODULAR GOITER. PT UNDERWENT RESECTION FOR MENINGIOMA 1-
2015 PMHX.SZ,HTN,DM TYPE 2 MENINGIOMA.
Medications:	KEPPRA,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (left more
than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
anterior temporal regions (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
