CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 6, no report of recent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  At times, the alpha rhythm reaches 10 Hz but at other times is significantly slower.  There is shifting arrhythmic delta in the temporal regions with somewhat rhythmic TIRDA noted from the left or right temporal region with a bit more arrhythmic slowing noted in the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation accentuates these findings.  The patient transitioned in and out of a drowsy state but sleep is not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Significant electrode artifact was noted in some portions of the record.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
A somewhat disorganized pattern.
Shifting slowing.
TIRDA noted independently from the right or the left, but right more so than the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG demonstrates more of a bihemispheric pattern.  If additional information is needed, a repeat study capturing more sleep may be helpful.
