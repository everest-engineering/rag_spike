CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed woman with cerebral palsy, hemiparesis and epilepsy. Seizures occur as right-sided shaking for a few seconds. The patient has experienced seizures this past year.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hertz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of 8 Hertz beta frequency activity observed in the background. Drowsiness is characterized by a n increase in slowing. As the patient transitions into sleep vertex waves and posts are Identified. The posts are a little bit more sharply contoured on the right compared to the left. Vertex waves are slightly asymmetric, a little bit more prominent on the right, and spindles are also a bit more prominent on the right than the left. Later on in the record when the patient is awakened from sleep there Is a more clearly defined 9 Hertz alpha rhythm again, with more of a field on the right compared to the left. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response present bilaterally.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess theta in wakefulness.
2. Some 8 Hertz alpha frequency activity in wit h t he posterior dominant rhythm.
3. Subtle asymmetries most predominately characterized by asymmetric sleep morphologies with a predisposition for the sleep morphologies to appear on the right hemisphere compared to the left. In addition, on occasion at the close of the record following hyperventilation, there was some left frontal 5 Hertz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. The asymmetries described above may be correlated with imaging.
