CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old woman with cerebral palsy and behavioral issues, evaluate for staring and crying outbursts.
MEDICATIONS: Zonegran, Zyprexa, Geodon, Keppra, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient has nearly continuous head rocking movements, but she is controllable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is cooperative, the background EEG is rich in beta. There is a glimpse of 9 hertz alpha rhythm, excess background theta. With her head rocking and scanning movements, very frequent lambda waves are identified in the occipital regions. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The head rocking is not a seizure. This patient's medications or underlying cerebral dysfunction may be responsible for the background slowing.
