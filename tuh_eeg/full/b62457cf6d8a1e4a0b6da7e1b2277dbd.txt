CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed male with hypertension, admitted on October 2, 2010 with repetitive tonic clonic seizures and bilateral shoulder injuries. No additional seizures, but persistently drowsy, status post shoulder repair.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ultram, Labetalol, Protonix, Lorazepam, Folic Acid, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes excess beta and excess theta. A 9 Hz alpha rhythm is identified intermittently and then the patient drifts off to sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific and maybe due to this patient's medications. It is somewhat unusual to see persistent slowing this many days post seizure, but the patient's perioperative management may also play a role.
