History:	69 YO MALE FOUND DOWN IN THE BATHROOM,UNKNOWN DOWN TIME.
PATIENT STATED HE FELL HIT HEAD LOC FOR 2 HRS.COULDN'T MOVE UPON
AWAKENING.PMH: HEADACHES, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, CP, SOB
Medications:	KEPPRA, LABETALOL, HEPARIN, PROTONIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was seen at 8Hz mainly in the right hemisphere.  Background activity
was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  In addition the left hemisphere appears to be
attenuated and slow maximally in the frontal region.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing and attenuation in the left frontal
region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition  there is
diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
