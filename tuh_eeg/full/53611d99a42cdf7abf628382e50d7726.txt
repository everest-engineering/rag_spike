CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed female, gravida 6, para 2, at 29.5 weeks gestation with headaches and epilepsy. Last seizure was in May.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta. In the transition to drowsiness, some of the theta is a bit more remarkable in the temporal regions, right more so than left, with what are initially notched 5 Hz activity which can be seen as a normal variant. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep with prominent posts and a small amount of snore artifact. Photic stimulation produces a driving response although the patient is drifting off to sleep.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are suspicious discharges in the right temporal region but these discharges can also be seen as a normal variant. These are seen only in very rare epochs in the record. To determine if this is a normal variant or an underlying epileptiform discharge, a more prolonged study capturing sleep is suggested. If this individual is having frequent spells in pregnancy, in or outpatient EEG monitoring may provide additional information.
