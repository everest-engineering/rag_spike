History:	59 YO FEMALE NSTEMI. OFF SEDATION EEG FOR EVALUATION
PT WAS PUT BACK ON PRECEDEX LAST NIGHT
Medications:	VERSED, FENTANYL, PANTOPRAZOLE, LASIX, INSULIN, DIGOXIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 13.5 hours from 10/30/2015 to 10/31/2015.  NursingÂ­ initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.  All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was some reactivity to painful stimuli in the last hours of the record..  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators	derate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
