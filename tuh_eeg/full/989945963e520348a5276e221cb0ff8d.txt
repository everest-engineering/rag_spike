REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 85-year-old man with history of change in mental status and a previous history of diabetes, hypertension, COPD, CHF, AFib, right ICA stenosis and old right parietal infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz.  This appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Overall, the majority of the record appears to be run in the theta frequency.  No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.
Heart rate 90 with frequent PVCs, some bigeminy and at one point, there is a run of what appears to be ventricular beats for 6 seconds.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, at times more temporally and at times more posteriorly and parietally with a decrease in the amplitude compared to the left hemisphere.  This slowing is seen at 2-4 Hz.
Moderate generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right hemispheric, mainly posterior temporoparietal as well as moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right posterior parietal temporal region, which is consistent with the known stroke.  in addition, there is evidence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
