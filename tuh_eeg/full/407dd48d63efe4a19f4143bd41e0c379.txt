CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed male status post head trauma after he was thrown off an ATV status post cranial surgery.  No bone flap on the right side.  He had one episode of questionable seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with one anterior temporal electrode and EKG electrode.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record showed loss of beta activity in the right frontocentral region.  There is a small amount of normal beta activity in the left frontocentral area.  The record also showed a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 to 10 Hz with 20 to 60 microvolts, which is reactive to eye movements symmetrically.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Photic stimulation revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves, maximum on F8-T4 at 1 to 2 Hz, with 20 to 50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Loss of beta activity in the right frontocentral.
Continuous slow waves in the right frontocentral area.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of right frontocentral cortical dysfunction which is consistent with the history of previous trauma. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
