CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy,Patient recalls nocturnal seizures.  Poor description of seizures, but seizures include shaking and postictal confusion.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cystic fibrosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Dilaudid, fentanyl, gabapentin, tramadol. Others
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically challenging EEG for a patient who is very warm and sweaty.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow, somewhat disorganized and relatively high amplitude.  The posterior dominant rhythm is approximately 8 hertz.  In this high amplitude, sharply contoured background, there are underlying left mid temporal sharp waves.  Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and seems to accentuate rhythmic 6 hertz theta activity from the left hemisphere and then some by temporal theta, more compatible with accentuation of underlying wicket.  The sleep state is somewhat similar to be awake state, but there is a bit more slowing and attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Deeper stages of sleep Are associated with a drop out of the higher amplitude sharply contoured theta frequency pattern and a more lower voltage mixed theta delta pattern.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response at faster flash frequencies.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Significant background slowing in the very high amplitude sharply contoured pattern.
Excess theta.
In this very challenging pattern, sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere, mid temporal, or anterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing and disorganization may be due to an underlying cerebral process or this patient's medications.  Despite the challenges described above, there are left temporal sharp waves.
There were no previous EEGs for comparison.
