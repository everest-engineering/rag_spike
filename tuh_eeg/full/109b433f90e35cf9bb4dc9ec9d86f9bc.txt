CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old male with a history of renal transplant, acute change in mental status with paranoia, hallucinations.  Profound changes shifts in serum sodium.
MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone, Ampicillin, Metoprolol, Calcitriol, Acyclovir, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency background rich in theta and beta.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep with vertex waves and sleep spindles.  A handful of POSTS were noted. Stimulation of the patient produces a brief alerting with alpha frequency activity and then the patient drifts off to sleep.
HR:    108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Background slowing.
Mixed frequency background.
An extremely drowsy individual.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  There were no specific hallmarks of a metabolic encephalopathy.  The presence of normal wave forms
of stage II sleep as well as alpha frequency with tactile stimulation is a positive prognostic feature.  No features of herpes encephalitis were observed.
