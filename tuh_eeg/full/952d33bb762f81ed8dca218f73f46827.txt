History:	30 YEAR OLD  RIGHT HANDED MALE. FIRST SEIZURE WAS "ABSENCE" WHEN A
CHILD. LATER DEVELOPED THEN EPISODES OF LOC,  INCONTINENCE,
TONGUES BITING WITH AURA OF COPPER TASTE. LAST SEIZURE IN SLEEP
LAST NIGHT. 2X 3 X A WEEK.
PMHX LOW BLOOD SUGAR , HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE .
Medications:	KEPPRA, TOPAMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. There is an intrahemispheric amplitude asymmetry with the alpha
rhythm on the right being three times the amplitude on the left.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Two bursts of subtle left midtemporal focal slowing were seen.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, left temporal, mid
Asymmetry, alpha, higher amplitude on right
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to 1. Intrahemispheric asymmetry in the
amplitude of the alpha rhythm with higher amplitude over the right hemisphere  2. Two bursts of
left temporal focal slowing  These findings are suggestive of a structural or functional process on
the left and may be consistent with a localization-related etiology for epilepsy.
