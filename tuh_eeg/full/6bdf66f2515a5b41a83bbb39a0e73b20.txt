CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old with epilepsy, evaluate for seizures.  Onset 2005, after the patient developed frontal encephalomalacia.  Now with intermittent dizziness and vertigo.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake stage 2 sleep with an overall very-low voltage record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  There is scant head rocking artifact noted.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in background slowing.  During stage 2 sleep, vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes are noted, but some of the vertex waves and spindles are asymmetric, a bit more prominent on the left.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep, but did elicit a scant driving response.
Heart rate 60-90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG was remarkable for:
Relatively low-voltage pattern for an adult.
Asymmetric sleep morphologies.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The asymmetric sleep morphologies may be associated with this patient's previous neurosurgical history.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison, but if this patient is thought to have frequent seizures, a repeat study or comparison with prior studies may be valuable.
