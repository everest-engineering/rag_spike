History:	81 yo F brought in by family for R sided weakness and slurred speech,  PMHX- HTN
HPL
MRI SHOWS PONTINE STROKE AND OCCLUSION OF BILATERAL AND
Medications:	Metoprolol, Zosyn
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  There is excess diffuse theta activity during brief periods of wakefulness.  Intermittent brief
bursts of diffuse frontally predominant delta activity is noted lasting 2-3 seconds.  During drowsiness,
the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region (F8/T4) during brief
periods of wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is also occasional independent
polymorphic right temporal slowing.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR is 100.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (R>L) temporal, Independent
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and
frequent bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  These findings are indicative
of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent
independent focal slowing in the bitemporal regions (right more than left) is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction.  Please note the patient is tachycardic.
