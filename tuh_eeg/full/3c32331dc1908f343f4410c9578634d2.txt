CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with AML and epilepsy, seizure free for the last 3 years.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenytoin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There is excess theta noted in the background. In addition, there is rhythmic temporal slowing a bit more prominent from the left temporal region than the right. Unfortunately, there is also some EKG artifact noted. As the recording continues, hyperventilation is performed. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate rhythmic slowing again particularly in the temporal regions and there are suspicious left anterior temporal sharp waves. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior alpha rhythm. POSTS are seen in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

HR: N/A

IMPRESSION: This EEG is technically challenging, but suggests:
1. A left temporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves. L temporal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: To more completely evaluate this patient's epilepsy, a follow-up study with better electrode impedance is suggested.
