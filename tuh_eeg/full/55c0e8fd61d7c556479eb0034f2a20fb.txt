CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed female in with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS:   Sevoflurane, Fentanyl, Etomidate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized. Anesthetic induction begins at 07:49 with the appearance of rhythmic delta, faster frequency activity and a burst suppression pattern at 07:50. The record is subtly discontinuous by 08:47.
Incision is made at 09:11
Clamp is placed at 955. Prior to the placement of the clamp at 09:55, there is a additional subtle asymmetry with a bit more theta on the left.  , there is generous beta, some subtle shifting asymmetry and an overall continuous pattern. The carotid was clamped at 09:55. There are some subtle bilateral changes, but no significant focal features noted. The carotid is clamped at 9:55 and a shunt is placed at that time. No additional focal features are noted prior to placement of the clamp and shunt. The shunt is removed at 10:44. The study concludes at 10:57.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this left carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for some subtle focal slowing appearing under anesthesia prior to placement of the clamp, but no additional focal features were noted with placement of the clamp.
