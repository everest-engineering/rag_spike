History:	25 year old woman with a history of a single convulsion in 2011. Medications:   Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Awake & asleep
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1!T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,frontal beta activity becomes more prominent,and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present over the left hemisphere, notably over the left midtemporal and centroparietal region. This is more pronounced during drowsiness and sleep. Frequently this activity is rhythmic. Frequent high amplitude left anterior temporal- centrotemporal and centroparietal sharp waves are present. Their frequency increases with drowsiness and sleep. Additionally,they become rhythmic,often occurring in brief (<10 sec) nonevolving runs, with a repletion rate up to 1Hz. No electrographic seizures are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent, left, during sleep
Sharp waves, abundant, left, anterior temporal- centrotemporal and centroparietal, during sleep Sleep, stage 2
