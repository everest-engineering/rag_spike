History:	52 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH PSYCHOSIS, AUDITORY HALLUCINATION,
SECLUSIVE, DELUSIONAL, DEPRESSION
SCHIZOPHRENIA; R/O SEIZURE DISORDER
Medications:	BENZTROPINE, LISINOPRIL, HALDOL, METOPROLOL, DIPHENHYDRAMINE,
METFORMIN, FAMOTIDINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases
during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 72  Technical difficulties: Continuous A2 electrode artifact.
No impedance check at onset.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of excess theta in wakefulness. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
