CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with bilateral leg tremulousness, history of leptospirosis at age 9 and a past history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the background with rhythmic delta which is more remarkable on the left hemisphere compared to the right. Following hyperventilation, as the patient becomes drowsy, there is some isolated, left frontal 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. The driving is, however, slightly better represented on the right compared to the left.
60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing from the left frontal region In hyperventilation and barely in
drowsiness.
2. Slightly asymmetric photic driving response.
CLINICAL Correlation: These findings can support a structural or functional process on the left but there were no epileptiform features. They may be correlated with a history of neurologic pathology.
