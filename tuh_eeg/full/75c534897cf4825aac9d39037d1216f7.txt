CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 38-year-old male with morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, enlarged, non dominant hemisphere stroke with persistent obtundation and right MCA stenosis.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Plavix, aspirin, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilohms.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is quite drowsy throughout the EEG, in tactile stimulation, as well as auditory stimulations used to alert the patient.  The background includes a posterior dominant rhythm on the left of 7.5 to 9 hertz.  Although it was difficult to maintain maximal wakefulness, in maximal wakefulness, there is a small amount of slowing in the left hemisphere.  The right hemisphere demonstrates disruption of the alpha rhythm with lower voltage, slower activity including a mixture of theta and delta.  When the patient is unstimulated and becomes a bit more drowsy, there is more of a lower voltage beta pattern that identified bilaterally with again more rhythmic lower voltage theta delta on the left.

Heart rate: 90 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage continuous focal slowing from the right with disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. A mild degree of slowing in the left hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right involving gray and white matter, congruent with a history of stroke.  Although the patient is excessively drowsy, even when stimulated, there is a small degree of slowing on the left suggesting that this process also impacts the left hemisphere as well.
