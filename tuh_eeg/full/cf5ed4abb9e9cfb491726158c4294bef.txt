LENGTH OF RECORDING:  27 minutes.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  HV and photic.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of seizures as well as alcohol abuse, breast cancer and hypertension.  The patient reportedly had a seizure 1 week ago.  The seizure was described as feeling dizzy followed by loss of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic convulsion with associated tongue biting and urinary incontinence as well as postictal fatigue.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are Keppra, Lamotrigine, Dilantin and Valium p.r.n.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude well-formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Fast alpha variant is captured as well.  Hyperventilation results in no change in the background.  Photic stimulation results in no change in the background.  No sleep is captured.  There is  nearly continuous EMG artifact observed over the bifrontal electrodes.  Occasional brief bilateral eye twitching with associated EMG artifact is captured.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 27 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured,  however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If  clinical suspicion of seizures persist a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  Several
episodes of brief bilateral eye twitching were captures with only associated EMG artifact noted on the surface EEG.
