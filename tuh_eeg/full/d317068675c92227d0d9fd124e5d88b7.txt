LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 36-year-old woman with new seizure onset approximately 1 to 2 years ago.  The seizures are described as an aura of dizziness followed by loss of consciousness with postictal confusion lasting about 30 minutes.  She has about 5 to 6 seizures per month.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are Dilantin and Keppra.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Hyperventilation produces mild symmetrical diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
