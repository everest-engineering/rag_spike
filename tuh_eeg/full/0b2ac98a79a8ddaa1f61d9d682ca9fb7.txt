CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old woman with history of seizures and hypertension found to have a cardiac arrest for about 20 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Benzodiazepines.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the recording there is a tremor that causes an artifact seen diffusely throughout the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The background is overall severely attenuated and no clear electrocerebral activity can be seen, however, the interpretation of this is effected by the fact that she has a continuously occurring tremor which can be seen as an artifact throughout the EEG.  It is difficult to ascertain if there is an underlying electrocerebral activity underneath the tremor artifact.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Severe attenuation and lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse marked attenuation.
Lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction which may be due to the hypoxic event and/or medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  No electrical correlate was seen with the tremor.  Although there is no clear electrocerebral activity seen no conclusions can be made about this due to the marked artifact from the tremor.
