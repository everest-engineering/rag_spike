History:	84 YR MALE ADM S/P PEA CODE FOR 30 MIN. ARRIVED ED LOST PULSE.
AGAIN AND CODED AGAIN. PT NOW WITH EYE AND MOUTH TWITCHING.
Medications:	FENTANYL, NOREPINEPHRINE, DOPAMINE, PROTONIX, ZOSYN HEPARIN,
MICLOIZOLAM,  PHENYLEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage to almost suppressed delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  During the record the patient has intermittent episodes lasting ~10
seconds of eye flickering and mouth movements.  The EEG during the episodes only reveals an
eye movement artifact and a glossokinetic artifact.  There is also a respirator induced artifact during
the entire record.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 126
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The intermittent artifact had no EEG correlate and appears most consistent with
