CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old woman with IV drug abuse admitted August 2nd, then August 27th.  Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Oxycodone, Lisinopril, Dilaudid, Metoprolol, ASA
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is scant amount of theta noted in the record.  There are occasional bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal frontal delta.  Epochs of stage II sleep include vertex waves. Paroxysmal, high-amplitude delta is noted as the patient starts to transition toward sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is transitioning in and out of sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Slightly abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bursts of paroxysmal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen in this EEG.  None were seen in the August 8th EEG.
