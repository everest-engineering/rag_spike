History:	46 Y/O FEMALE H/O CEREBELLAR AVM S/P EMBOLIZATION,PRESENTS WITH
HEADACHE, FEVER AND NECK STIFFENS. NURSE THINKS PT MAY BE HAVING
SEIZURES. SEEN THIS AM R EYE GLAZE AND NOT RESPONDING .
Medications:	5 VERSED,50 FENTANYL,10 VECURONIUM,20   PROPOFOL    KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no EEG background
reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. Some muscle artifact could be seen.  Hr was 120.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
