CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old man with end-stage renal disease, hypertension, CABG and CAD with episodes of unresponsiveness lasting for about 5 minutes.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra

REASON FOR STUDY: The patient's unresponsiveness

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. the patient was lethargic during the-testing. Photic stimulation was performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: Continuous muscle artifact over both temporal lobes and movement artifact during the recording.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow background in the theta frequencies with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz with an amplitude of 20-to-60- microvolts. It appears at times to be reactive to eye opening There is an increased amount from the central beta. No normal sleep architecture is seen. Activating procedures were photic stimulation but there are no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves in the F7/T1 electrodes at times seem in monomorphic bursts.
2. Focal slow waves at F8/T2 seen rarely.
3. Generalized. slow waves of.5 to 7 Hz.

SEIZURES: None.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Independent anterior temporal focal slowing.
2. Generalized slow waves

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This limited EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in both anterior temporal regions (right more than left). which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. At times the left anterior temporal slow waves become monomorphic but not clearly consistent with TIRDA No seizures were seen.
