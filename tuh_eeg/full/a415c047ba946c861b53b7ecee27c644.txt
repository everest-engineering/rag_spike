CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old male with PMHX of Bipolar, Schizophrenia with two episodes of LOC. First two weeks ago, felt short of breath, LOC seconds and then post as dizzy for less than 10 mines. Happened again this morning, Mother with PMHX of sizes

MEDICATIONS:  Abilify, Cogentin, Depakote.

HISTORY:  A 24-year-old male with bipolar disease, schizophrenia, and possible epilepsy.  Two episodes of loss of consciousness in recent weeks with shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, and then dizziness.  Family history of epilepsy.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

This is a technically satisfactory record with the exception of increased impedance in the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall background includes excess theta and a modest amount of background beta.  There is some head rocking artifact in the posterior regions.

Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing some posteriorly predominant slowing.  In addition, there was some shifting slowing noted during hyperventilation as well.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with driving at 3 Hz and faster flash frequencies.  Heart rate 84 bpm.

Sleep was characterized by posts.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram for an adult of this age due to:
1. Excess background theta.
2. A mildly disorganized record for an adult of this age.
3. Some shifting, slowing, particularly in the posterior regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The background slowing described in this record is a nonspecific finding, as is the disorganization.  The patient's underlying neuropsychiatric
