CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed male with right temporal lobe tumor removed December 2008; seizure-free since that time but with some visual field defects.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Mirtazapine, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel of EKG. The technologist reports that the patient has an unusual hair style which makes it difficult to place electrodes properly.   DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm with generous activity in the occipital regions. Wicket is noted. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in theta which is a little bit more prominent in the right centrotemporal region. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing additional theta, again right temporal more than left. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing and slow-rolling eye movements as well as an increase in beta. Photic stimulation does not significantly alter the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle, right temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are compatible with the previous neurosurgery history note. No epileptiform features were observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing additional stages of sleep or using special electrodes may be of value.
