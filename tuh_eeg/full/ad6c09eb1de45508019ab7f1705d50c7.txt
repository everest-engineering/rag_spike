CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old left handed male with history of 2 strokes and seizures with past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, for followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol, Metoprolol, Plavix, Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Trilipix.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz and is seen best over the right hemisphere.  There is some frontocentral beta also seen better over the right hemisphere.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously in the right hemisphere, maximal at F7/T3 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
