History:	67 YR OLD MAN R HANDED.HAS A CONSTANT SHAKING WHEN HE FIRST CAME
IN AND EVEN NOW THAT HE IS RELAXED. PT SAYS IT STARTED 3 MONTHS
AGO. IF HE SITS UP STRAIGHT IT WILL STOP. 60 CM HEAD
Medications:	Lithium
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, Excessive theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing and
slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
