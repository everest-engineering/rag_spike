CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old right handed woman with a history of epilepsy, status post stroke with thrombolysis, now with slurred speech, right MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  On the left there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The left hemisphere is a bit disorganized and there is intermittent delta noted in the left hemisphere, as well as a small amount of theta.  The right hemisphere is more significantly different with sharply contoured high amplitude 2-3 Hz delta activity.  There are also sharp waves identified in the record, most of which are at T4, some nearly isoelectric F8/T4, others with spread to C4, and even a handful T6.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the background, as well as disappearance of the alpha on the left.  The patient arouses spontaneously.  There are a handful of sharp waves maximum at C4. There is also some underlying wicket noted in the background.
HR:    78 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Overall background slowing and disorganization, including the left hemisphere.
Arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, maximum at T4.
Sharp waves identified in the right hemisphere typically maximum at T4, but with some variability and some are seen at C4, T6, or nearly isoelectric.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features can be seen with a right MCA infarct, but the sharp waves support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.  Comparison with studies prior to this patient's stroke would be helpful.
