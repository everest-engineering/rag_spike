History:	27 year old woman with a history of nocturnal seizures.
Medications:	PERCOCET (PER PT LAST TAKEN 2 DAYS AGO), XANAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse, frontally predominant 15-20uV, 18-25Hz beta
activity is also seen.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 41-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were
present. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
of epilepsy.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
