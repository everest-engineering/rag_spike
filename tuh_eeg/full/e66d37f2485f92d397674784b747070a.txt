HISTORY:  61 YR FEMALE WITH HTN, HLO, OM, ANXIETY, FOUND ON FLOOR UNCONSCIOUS. CONFUSED AND ODD SPEECH.
MEDICATIONS:   COLYTE. FERROUS SULFATE, LEVSIN/SL. COZAAR, MEVACOR, PERCOCET, ASA, GLUCOPHAGE. ZOLOFT, PRILOSEC, XANAX. AMBIEN. ACTOS, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG TYPE:	Routine, awake & drowsy
TECHNIQUE: 	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake. drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5- 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric S-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation. and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps} does not produce any effect.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
INTERPRETATION: This is a ABNORMAL EEG, due to mild excessive theta during wakefulness. These findings are etiologically nonspecific Indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
