CLINICAL HISTORY: A 45-year-old male, found unresponsive, Incontinent with hyperthermia, T 100.6.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, aspirin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICY using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was intubated, unresponsive, and attempts were being made to cool the patient This Is a technically acceptable record, aside from T1-T2
Impedances.
DESCRIPTION THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous, low-voltage record with brief bursts of beta or fast activity followed by attenuation. There is reactivity and variability noted in the record, and stimulation produces a bit more faster frequency activity. Occasional bursts of frontal delta were noted.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to due to a markedly stow pattern with bursts of beta.
This EEG Is most supportive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting response, which Is a positive prognostic factor. If additional information is needed, a repeat study when the patient is out of the ICY may be considered.
