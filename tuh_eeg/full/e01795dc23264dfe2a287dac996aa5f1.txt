History:	80 YR MALE WITH CHANGE IN MS X3 DYS NOW.   CONFUSED HALLUCINATING.
PRIOR TO THIS PT ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING FOR SELF.  PMHX:
Medications:	LORAZEPAM TOTAL 4 MG THIS AM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular 4-7Hz activity.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes
more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.  The patient exhibits intermittent sudden jerks/Twitching. A myogenic artifact
is seen but no EEG correlate.  At times there are some sharply countoured discharges in the
temporal lobes.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of moderate diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The clinical jerks had no EEG correlate.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
