21 year old right handed male with 3 concussions with change In mental
status and vomiting.
MEDICATIONS: None
REASON FOR STUDY: Rule out seizure.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement system with anterior, and EKG electrodes. Sleep was recorded.
No activation procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The records opens to an asymmetric posterior dominant
rhythm seen only on the right hemisphere with a frequency of 9 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60
microvolts. There is frontal central beta only seen on the right hemisphere. Sleep is
characterized by stage I and stage II sleep. No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
ABNORMAL There is continuous left hemispheric delta at 2 to 4 Hz and an
amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts which is maximal at times in the T3 and sometimes TS
electrodes. There is absence of the posterior dominant rhythm in that region as stated above.
At times there were infrequent sharply contoured waveforms at T3, but not frankly epileptic.
SEIZURES; None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous left hemispheric delta maximal in the temporal and at times posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction
in the left hemisphere maximal and mid temporal to posterior temporal region which has a high
correlation with a lesion in that region. No seizures were seen. These findings were discussed
with consult team at 11:30 on
