History:	59 year old man with persistently depressed mental status.
Medications:	INSULIN, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Frequent brief high amplitude eye-blinking-like artifact is noted.  It
correlates with a brief abdominal jerk.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG because of diffuse moderate-to-severe background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  When compared to the EEG from 5/19/2014, there has been
no significant change in the background.
