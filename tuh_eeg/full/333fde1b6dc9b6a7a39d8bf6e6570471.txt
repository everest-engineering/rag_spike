History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON PT WITH CHANGE IN MS.ADM WITH SZS.    PMHX:
SEIZURES, ALZHEIMER'S.
Medications:	DILANTIN, ATORVASTATIN, FOLIC ACID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Rare focal sharp waves discharges are present in the left
anterior temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7/T3.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, few, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of few epileptiform discharges in
the left anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus
in this region,   and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
