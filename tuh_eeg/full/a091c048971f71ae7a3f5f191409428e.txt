CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with previous, comprehensive evaluation for generalized seizures with tongue biting, clenching fists, falling, and confusion without EEG change.  This is a repeat EEG for recurrent symptoms.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Technically satisfactory 1 hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Impedances of most electrodes were below 5 kilohms.  This EEG captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
Clinical Correlation:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with posterior slow waves of youth.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs noted in stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 66 bpm.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
IMPRESSION:  Normal 1 hour EEG.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Previous EEGs have identified the patient's characteristic behaviors, which did not have an EEG signature.
