CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with HIV disease, epilepsy, previous stroke with right hemiparesis, head trauma, and a craniotomy defect.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan Prozac, Trileptal, Abilify, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the alpha rhythm reaches 9 Hz, 30 microvolts.  There is an asymmetry noted between the 2 hemispheres.  The activity is higher amplitude on the left.  There is underlying focal slowing from the left hemisphere which can include disruption of the posterior dominant rhythm, an increase in theta, and at times more sustained more regular rhythmic mixed theta delta.

In wakefulness and drowsiness, occasional medium to high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves were noted.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and slow rolling eye movements.

Photic stimulation elicits subtle bilateral driving.  There were occasional sharp waves noted from the left anterior temporal region during photic stimulation.

Heart rate:  78 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left temporal region with disruption of faster frequency and left temporal theta and delta.
2. Occasional left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left, with perhaps a skull defect given the breach rhythm.  The sharp waves suggest a focal mechanism for epilepsy, congruent with a history above.
