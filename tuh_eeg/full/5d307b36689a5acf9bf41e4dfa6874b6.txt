History:	29 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  EPISODE OF GEN NUMBNESS OVER
HER BODY, STOPPED RESPONDED THEN BECAME FLACCID. PT REPORTS
SIMILAR EPISODE DURING LAST PREGNANCY.
Medications:	LISINOPRIL. NO AED.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The predominant background is characterized by a 9 to 9.5 Hz, 25-40uV symmetric alpha rhythm
with good attenuation on eye opening.  During sleep, the background is characterized by a mixture
of moderate voltage theta and delta activity.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Heart rate was 84
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and mostly asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were
