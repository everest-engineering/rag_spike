CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with past medical history of aneurysm clip, seizures.  Last seizure was in June 2011, now with headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Dilantin, Benzonatate, Omeprazole, Motrin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  There is a large amount of sleep during the recording with stage I and II.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F4 continuously with associated breech.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal right slowing and breech.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right frontal region which is consistent with a known surgery in that region.  No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.
