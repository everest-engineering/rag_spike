CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old woman with 8-year history of episodic shaking and trembling.  Symptoms started on the right side, may spread to the left and may be associated with loss of consciousness or amnestic spell.  Seizures wax and waned.  Symptoms followed by tremulousness in the size.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Depakote, topiramate, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a routine 20-minute EEG with impedance is under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1, T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG was well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and intermittent attenuation of the alpha rhythm as well as rhythmic central theta.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited minimal driving.
IMPRESSION:  normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. This is the second normal EEG for this patient.  A  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if this patient's clinical features warrant, more prolonged study capturing her symptoms may be evaluated.
