TRANSFER.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent brief bursts (1-2 seconds) of frontally predominant
generalized spike-and-wave discharges and polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur at a rate of
about every 10-20 seconds.  Clinically the patient exhibits a sudden truncal jerk and upward gaze
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 102
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), frequent diffuse, q10-20 seconds
Attenuation, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  periodic generalized epileptiform discharges and severe
diffuse attenuation of the background.  These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction and cortical irritability.  In the setting of hypoxic injury, this pattern is consistent with a
