History:	21 year old woman presents with an episode concerning for seizures.  Patient has
extensive PMH, including VP shunt via right posterior approach.
Medications:	TOPAMAX, KEPPRA, RISPERIDONE, ZOLPIDEM, NEURONTIN, TRAZODONE,
AMBIEN, BACLOFEN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates.
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right posterior temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, posterior, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 22 minute  EEG due to intermittent mild-to-
moderate focal slowing in the  right posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
