CLINICAL HISTORY: A 20-year-old right handed woman with long history of refractory epilepsy with absence seizures., tonic colonic, myoclonic and multiple daily drop attacks
MEDICATIONS: Zarontin, Depakote, Vimpat, clorazepate, others.
INTRODUCTION: A 30-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically challenging EEG. The patient was awake.  Sleep was not achieved.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 94 microvolts.  Central Mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Hyperventilation was performed with a significant amount of artifact in the background and there was a suggestion of an asymmetry and hyperventilation of unclear significance.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Technically challenging, but unremarkable EEG in wakefulness through drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  These underlying focal features identified in hyperventilation should be interpreted with caution given the artifacts noted at that time.
