CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old male who had an event where he fell down the stairs and was subsequently shaking. Evaluate for possible seizures.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake EEG. There is no hyperventilation and there is an extraordinary amount of muscle noted in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Frequent eye blink artifact is noted and generous beta is observed. Photic stimulation is essentially obscured by muscle artifact but there is a suggestion of a driving response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. In addition, that might help eliminate the muscle artifact.
