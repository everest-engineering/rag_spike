History:	57 YR FEMALE ADM WITH 3 EPISODES OF RUE TWITCHING ASSOC WITH
URINATING. GLUCOSE IN 800'S NON COMPLIANT WITH MEDS.  PMHX:
ESOPHAGITIS, CIRRHOSIS,  DM, HTN, ASTHMA
Medications:	Gabapentin, Lorazepam, Insulin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  At times sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptiform.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
