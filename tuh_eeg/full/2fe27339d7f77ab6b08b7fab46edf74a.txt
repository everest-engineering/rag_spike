system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a disorganized background
specificity in the left side. There is a low voltage with some symmetry in the right side.

drowsiness, the patient exhibits slowing and vertex waves and K complex characteristic
of stage II sleep.
HR: 70bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. low voltage alpha beta.
