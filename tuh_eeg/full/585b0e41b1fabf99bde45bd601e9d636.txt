History:	54 year old man status post PEA code on 12/1-/2014 and today, now with
myoclonic jerks.  Of note, patient coded at the end of the recording.
Medications:	HEPARIN, MIDAZOLAM, FENTANYL, LEVOPHED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-
moderate amplitude theta and delta activity admixed with frequent moderate amplitude bilateral
central/ parasagittal spikes and polyspikes with broad field.  At times,  these epileptiform discharges become rhythmic at 1-1.25 Hz and come in brief (~3-5 seconds) runs.  There is rapid change in the background at ~ 3:07:20 pm characterized by rapid loss of faster frequencies, diffuse background
attenuation and rapid progression to complete background suppression with no evidence of
electrocerebral activity.  Review of the single EKG lead demonstrates that changes in cerebral
activity preceded changes in EKG.  The recording is paused for ~ 11 minutes at the end of the
recording epoch.  By the end, there is no cerebral activity observed at 2 microvolts and EKG
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity, by the end of the recording
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Spikes, frequent, bilateral central
Interpretation:
This is a very ABNORMAL 20 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that progresses to
electrocerebral inactivity by the end of the recording.  Review of the single EKG lead demonstrates
that changes in cerebral activity preceded changes in EKG.
