CLINICAL HISTORY: A 24-year-old female with cardiac pathology and life-time rare
episodes of loss of awareness without clear loss of consciousness. No tonic clonic
activity.

MEDICATIONS: Alprazolam, Metoprolol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG monitoring. Hyperventilation and
photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a youthful, well-organized 11.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage with central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of rhythmic theta. There is some slightly asymmetric eye movement artifact compatible with slight asymmetry in electrode placement. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional testing may be considered.
