History:	39 YR OLD MAN PRESENTS WITH H/O ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, PT HAS NO
HX OF PSYCH
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was reached 9Hz.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is
present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  No normal sleep architecture
was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left more than the right midtemporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left more than the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
