CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old male with acute subdural hematoma status post
craniectomy with perioperative seizures not otherwise described.
MEDICATIONS: Pantoprazole, Keppra, Dilantin, Zofran
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated and moving
the right side of the body only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a relatively
slow pattern with a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta. There is an asymmetry between
the two hemispheres with more significant delta activity from the right hemisphere
compared to the left and disruption of faster frequency activity. Stimulation of the
patient produces rhythmic faster frequency activity from the frontal regions.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster
frequency activity and a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features noted in this record.
The findings are congruent with the patient's clinical history and neuroanatomical
pathology.
