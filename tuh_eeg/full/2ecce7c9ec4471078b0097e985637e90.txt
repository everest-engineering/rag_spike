CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old male recently diagnosed with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  No prior EEGs were available at this time for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal extended outpatient EEG, awakened to stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional testing may be of value.   This is the 3rd normal EEG for this individual.  Of note, this is the second EEG with bradycardia and a single previous EEG demonstrated tachycardia.
