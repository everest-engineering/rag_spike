CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old female with a history of seizures described as tonoclonic who had a seizure last Tuesday.  The seizures started 6 to 8 months.
MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness only.
With one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous myogenic muscle artifact throughout the recording.  The patient was recorded only during wakefulness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The hyperventilation __________ a diffuse slowing response and the photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 much more frequently then F8/T4.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing, left more than right.
Heart rate 90.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction (left more than right), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
