History:	77 year old male with intracranial hemorrhage, change in mental status and a
history of complex partial seizures.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right hemisphere.
The background over the left consists of 8- 8.5 Hz PDR, excess polymorphic theta activity and
preserved AP gradient.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of polymorphic 8 Hz
PDR with poor AP gradient, excess theta and delta activity.  During wakefulness over the right there
is overriding prominent semi-rhythmic delta activity that  resolves during drowsiness and sleep.
Sleep is characterized by diffuse theta and delta activity and occasional sleep spindles.  Sleep
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric, more prominent anteriorly
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 22-seconds EEG due to continuous moderate
right hemispheric slowing that is more pronounced during wakefulness. This finding is indicative of
a focal structural lesion in this region.  No electrographic seizures are present.
