History:	72 year old woman status post resection and gamma knife of left cavernous sinus
schwannoma.  Patient now has hallucinations and odd behaviors that occur daily.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a low amplitude poorly modulated 7.5-8 Hz theta
activity.  There is expected AP gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes.  Continuous
polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left temporal region.  Intermittent left
midtemporal moderate amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slowing waves are noted, maximal
over T3 lead.  Sleep spindles are captured, they are more prominent over the left.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, left temporal, mid, maximal over T3
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing; (2)
continuous moderate focal left temporal focal slowing and (3) intermittent left midtemporal
epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and epileptiform discharges in the left temporal
region are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in that region.
