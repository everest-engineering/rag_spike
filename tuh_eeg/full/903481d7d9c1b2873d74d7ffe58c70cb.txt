History:	23 year old woman with a history of seizures since High school.  Seizures occur ~
once per year.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The AP gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-
7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Several brief bursts (0.5 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal spike-and-wave discharges and
polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of ~4.5-5 Hz.  They are ere
was no clinical correlate associated to this EEG activity documented on video.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from ___ to ___ fps.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
