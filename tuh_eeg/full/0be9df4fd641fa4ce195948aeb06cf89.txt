LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 60-year-old woman who presents with a history of dizzy spells, the most recent about 10 days ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Meclizine p.r.n., Pravachol, and amlodipine.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) and vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation produces several bursts of diffuse polymorphic delta activity as well as mild symmetrical background slowing.  Photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead reveals a regular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
