History: 82 year old man with history of AD, now presents with 2-days of change in mental status.
Medications: COMMODORE
Sedation:
EEG Typo: Awake &asleep, portable
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse very low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
During sleep vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. An irregular heart rate is noted on a single
EKG lead.
Summary of findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
No epileptiform discharges
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 2 1-minute EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings a re etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
