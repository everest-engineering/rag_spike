CLINICAL HISTORY:   Seizures, dementia, prior status epilepticus. Brain injury
MEDICATIONS:  Namenda, Klonopin, Depakote, lisinopril, Remeron, Dilantin, Keppra, and Aricept.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  Prominent left cranial scar was noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG was somewhat slow with a 6-7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Superimposed upon this, there was an asymmetry with slower activity noted in the left hemisphere.  In addition, intermittent relatively rhythmic delta was noted in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including left central or left posterior temporal. At times, the rhythmic slowing was sharply contoured at C3.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in rhythmic slowing in both hemispheres.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with variable maximum.
Sharply contoured slowing with some C3 maximum sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A previous EEG from 2010 is available for comparison.  This patient had status epilepticus at that time.  This EEG demonstrates an improvement in overall background.  The focal slowing as well as the bihemispheric slowing may be correlated with this patient's clinical scenario.
