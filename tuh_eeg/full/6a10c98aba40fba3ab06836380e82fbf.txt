Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm.  Background activity is
predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central more delta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of diffuse background slowing and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
