CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old woman with a seizure 2-3 weeks ago characterized by shaking with foaming at her mouth and eyes rolling back in her head.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, zolpidem, alprazolam, Endocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an alpha rhythm of 13 Hz in a background with generous beta.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in frontal central beta and attenuation of the alpha rhythm, followed by posts.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response despite the prominence of faster frequency activity.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there is subtle asymmetry in the distribution of beta in the frontal regions.
Heart rate 48 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness is remarkable for:
Bradycardia.
Prominent beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The prominent beta in this record may be associated with the use of benzodiazepines.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep or using special activation procedures may be of value.
