CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman with epilepsy for the last 2
years, tonic clonic seizures, asthma and bipolar disease.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zoloft, Hydralazine, Diltiazem, Combivent, Folic Acid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern rich
in beta frequency activity. There is a low voltage, somewhat poorly defined alpha
rhythm. Features of drowsiness Include an increase in background theta. Photic
stimulation elicits scant driving.
70 bpm
This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Mild excess beta.
2. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed. Additional
EEG recording may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
