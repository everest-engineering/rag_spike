History:	57 year old woman with a history of seizures and strokes.  Frequency of her events
has increased in the last 2 months.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with
eye opening.  There is expected AP gradient.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta and delta activity
are noted.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) is occasionally seen over the left.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and occasional
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity). Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic
delta activity) indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology that carries increased
epileptogenic potential.
