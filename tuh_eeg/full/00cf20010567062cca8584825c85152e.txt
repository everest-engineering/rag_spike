CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with numbness in 2 fingers of the
right hand following biopsy of a left-sided brain tumor in recent weeks.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
well-organized background with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed
early on in the record producing bursts of rhythmic frontal delta some of which are a
little more generous on the right than the left. Features of drowsiness include an
increase in background slowing. Following hyperventilation, the patient remains
relatively awake but with frequent eye blink artifact. Brief drowsiness includes bursts of
rhythmic frontal delta, again somewhat confounded by the artifact. Photic stimulation
elicits scant driving.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no significant epileptiform or focal features noted. A slightly asynchronous hyperventilation response is of unclear clinical significance. If epilepsy Is an important consideration, a followup study may be helpful.
