Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excessive diffuse beta is noted.  No sleep.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr. was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
