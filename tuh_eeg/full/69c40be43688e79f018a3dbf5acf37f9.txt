CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed male with epilepsy, seizure-free for 1 year.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient attempts to posture and turns toward his right during the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Despite a fair amount of muscle artifact, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm identified with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted but the absence of epileptiform activity does not excluded a diagnosis of epilepsy.
