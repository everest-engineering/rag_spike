History: 67 yo man with transient difficulty with expression 09/28/13 on two occasions and stroke.
Medications: Depakote.
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 2540uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric 5·15uV, 18-25Hz activity Is present, maximal over t he right hemisphere.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent. and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 24Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal at F7/T3 region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right
anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges
are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped
photic stimulation from 1·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left anterior
temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is
intermittent focal slowing in the right temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, Which is etiologically non-specific. No electrographic seizures are present.
