CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old male with head trauma, seizure, and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, ceftriaxone, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  No seizures are recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG in wakefulness includes at times a somewhat slow pattern with excess theta.  There are focal seizures with attenuation of faster frequency activity noted on the left.  The sleep recording demonstrates a little bit less in the way of focal slowing.  Vertex waves and spindles can be identified in sleep.  Occasional bursts of frontal delta are noted.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Focal slowing from the left temporal region which is somewhat improved at the end of the EEG recording.
Two left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with recent head trauma, to some extent the focal features seem to be improving.
