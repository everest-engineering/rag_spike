CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with tonic clonic seizures followed by confusion.  Last seizure 3 months ago.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Depakote.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had fasted on the morning of the study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, at times there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall EEG in wakefulness demonstrates intermittent excess theta.  In addition, prior to hyperventilation, there are bursts of high amplitude rhythmic delta activity without definitive spike and wave activity.  Hyperventilation accentuates bursts of high amplitude delta.  Some of these bursts have a right or left frontal sharp wave or spike.  Following hyperventilation, the bursts are seen as the patient transitions towards drowsy.  Most bursts are approximately 5 seconds in duration.  Photic stimulation elicited driving response but may well augment the frontally predominant spike and wave activity.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity which is at times subtle and is 2-3 Hz in duration.
2. Bursts of prominent frontal delta.
3. Modest background slowing and disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is more supportive of a secondarily generalized mechanism for epilepsy given the spike and wave activity which is below 3 Hz as well as the mild asymmetries noted.  No seizures were recorded.
