History:	88 YO FEMALE P/W COLON CANCER AND LEFT BREAST LUMPECTOMY. 2
DAYS OF LEFT HAND WEAKNESS. FOUND TO HAVE SMALL RIGHT FRONTAL
HEMORRHAGE AND BRAIN MASS. PT TO GO HOME ON HOSPICE. EEG TO
RULE OUT NCSE
Medications:	INSULIN, LISPRO
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Frequently frontocentral faster frequencies can be seen.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory and
tactile stimuli.  HR was 90.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
