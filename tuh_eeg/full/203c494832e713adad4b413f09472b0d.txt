History:	65 YO MALE WITH HX OF SZ AND MENTALLY CHALLENGED. FAMILY REPORTS
HE HAS NOT HAD SZ'S IN >1 YEAR. EVENTS INCLUDED TONGUE BITING AND
EYES ROLLED UP IN HEAD, SHAKING FOR ABOUT 2-3 MIN. BASELINE TOOK
AN HOUR.
Medications:	Dilantin, Luminal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a  low voltage 15-20uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5 uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
No focal slowing is present.  During HV a single brief bursts (9 seconds) of symmetric generalized
frontally-maximal spike-and-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of 3 to 3.5Hz.  No
clinical correlate was noted during this burst. However the patient was not tested.  There were some
fragments of GSW seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, with an epileptiform burst
(see above).  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any
effect.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, 3Hz, few generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of  generalized epileptiform discharges,
which is consistent with a diagnosis of  idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  No seizures were seen.
