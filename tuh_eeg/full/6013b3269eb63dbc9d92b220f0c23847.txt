History:	30 MALE FOUND DOWN AND TAKEN TO OSH WHERE HE CODED FOR 10 MIN.
CTH SHOWS DIFFUSE CEREBRAL EDEMA.
H/O HEROIN ABUSE
UDS NEGATIVE
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies
is not seen.  There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.  There is no
spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile
stimuli.  This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical
Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84  There is an bifrontal intermittent artifact seen throughout the
recording. It dose not appear to be cerebral in nature.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an isoelectric EEG but it was not performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the
determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  In the absence of any medication or sedatives that
could account for this the record can be consistent but not diagnostic of, cerebral death. Please
note that no definite conclusions can be stated particularly in the setting of artifacts.
