INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE NOTE
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and
EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep stage I and stage II were recorded as well as activation Procedures including photic
stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, simvastatin, aspirin, Zestoretic, metoprolol, Aggrenox, phenytoin.
HISTORY:
A 49-year-old female with a history of hypertension, seizures, left MCA, stroke, hyperlipidemia, chronic impairment here to
rule out stroke versus Bell paralysis.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm better seen over only the right hemisphere at 9-10 Hz and 20 to 60
microvolts amplitude, which reacts to eye opening and closing. It was seen with a less degree of amplitude over the left
hemisphere but It Is present there. There is some frontocentral beta seen best over the right hemisphere also. Sleep is
characterized by stage I and stage II. Activation procedures Including photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE:
Date of Procedure: 09/12/11
1. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's): Seen at F7/T3 at 0.5 to 1 Hz with an amplitude of 50 to 100
microvolts. Seen almost continuously throughout the entire recording.
2. Focal slow waves at F7/T3 seen continuously with a 2 to 4 Hz frequency and 20 to 70 microvolts amplitude.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal awake and sleep EEG due to PLED's in the left anterior temporal region as well as focal slow waves in the same
region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in the left anterior temporal region. PLED's can be
seen in acute cortical lesions such as a stroke secondary to active infectious like herpes. No seizures were seen during
this recording.
