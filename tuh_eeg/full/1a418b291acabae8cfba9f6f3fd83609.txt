CLINICAL HISTORY: 85 year old woman, status post fall with left subdural hematoma, status post evacuation.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Famotidine, Metoprolol, Ancef, Coumadin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were also performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During the record there was a disorganized pattern, asymmetric with intrahemispheric slowing seen on the right side. There was on the left side 5 Hz theta as well as 1 to 2 Hz delta seen. There was evidence on the record of breech rhythm on the left. There was background slowing. Sharp waves were seen in the left hemisphere.
HR: 75 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right-sided slowing.
2. Left-sided sharp waves
3. Focal slowing in a bihemispheric pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no formed epileptiform discharges at this time but clinical correlation should evaluate right-sided slowing.
