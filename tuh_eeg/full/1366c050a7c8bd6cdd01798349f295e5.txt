REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 33-year-old woman with a history of seizures and a right parietal lesion, possible dysplasia.  There were recurring seizures during sleep, lasting 1-2 minutes, the last one last Sunday.
Here for differential and classification of intractable events.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.  There were no abnormal discharges.  The patient recorded in wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen rarely at P4, at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, and a frequency of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to right parietal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right parietal region, which is nonspecific with regard to the etiology, but may be related to the known lesion/ dysplasia. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
