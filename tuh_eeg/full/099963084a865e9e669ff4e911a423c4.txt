History:	61 year old man with a history of a prior stroke, now presents with worsening
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During several brief arousals, the background consists of 7.5 Hz theta posteriorly, poor AP gradient
and excess polymorphic theta activity.  Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the recording.
Vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured and there is asymmetry in the sleep architecture with
sleep architecture better visualized over the right.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left hemisphere.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
No epileptiform discharges
Asymmetry, sleep architecture, better visualized over the right
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and mostly asleep 22-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and continuous moderate left hemispheric focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal
slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the left.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
