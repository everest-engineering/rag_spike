CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old gentleman, who had an episode with loss of consciousness, mild generalized shaking after ingestion of marijuana and opioid.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and very minimally drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Very brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling  eye movements.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were seen.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
