HISTORY:  This is a 40-year-old male with, who was evaluated 2-1/2 years ago for a first tonic-clonic seizure.  Now, with impaired short-term memory,
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, hydralazine, and hydrochlorothiazide.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed, but sleep was not achieved.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz, 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and a small increase in beta, but sleep was not sustained.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited supra harmonic driving.
Heart rate:  78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second normal EEG for this adult.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged or sleep deprived record is suggested.
