History:	43 YO FEMALE W/ DRUG OVERDOSE (BENZODIAZEPINE). HX OF PRIOR
OVERDOSE AND SEVERAL ATTEMPTED SUICIDES.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.There is no normal cerebral activity seen.  There is
diffuse amplitude suppression seen interspersed with bursts of high amplitude spikes consistent with
a burst-suppression pattern.  The suppression:burst ration varies from 1:10-1:5.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.   On 3 occasions, there are 4 second continuous bursts of 3Hz spike
activity.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 40 minute EEG because of a burst suppression pattern.  There is no normal
cerebral activity seen.  In the absence of a pharmacological cause such as drug intoxication, burst
suppression carries a grave prognosis for neurological recovery.
