DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with underlying delta and movement artifact. The patient is quite restless throughout. As she becomes more agitated, there is an increase in delta. The EEG intermittently attenuates.

HR: 70 to 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
