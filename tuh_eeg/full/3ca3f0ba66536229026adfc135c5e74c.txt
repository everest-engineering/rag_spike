MEDICATIONS:  none reported
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory record in terms of impedances.  The patient appeared to be a little tense.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 9 Hz alpha rhythm with generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral theta.  With alerting, the EEG is clearly, well organized, and an alpha squeak with an increase in alpha to 10.5 hertz was noted.  Features of drowsiness including increase in beta and scant theta.
Photic stimulation elicited a subtle driving response.  Lambda was noted.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted for this individual who was described as sleep deprived prior to the EEG, the patient did not appear to be particularly sleepy.
