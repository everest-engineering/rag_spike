History:	36 year old woman with history of seizures, now her mental status is worsening and
she has frequent staring episodes.
Medications:	Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of relatively monomorphic moderate
amplitude diffuse delta activity with occasional diffuse polymorphic theta activity.  During
drowsiness, EMU disappears, diffuse triphasic-like waveforms and very low amplitude underriding
Several sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are captured, left>>right.  Left hemispheric sharp
waves have a very broad field with maximal scalp negativity over P3 lead.  A single low amplitude
sharp wave over the right has maximal scalp negativity over  the C4/P4 lead.
Hyperventilation is attempted but is not successful.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates of 7 fps.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Sharp waves, one, right, centroparietal
Sharp waves, few, left parietal, very broad field and variable amplitude
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal 34-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse
background slowing and several left parietal and one centroparietal epileptiform discharges.
Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  There are two independent epileptogenic foci: left parietal region and
