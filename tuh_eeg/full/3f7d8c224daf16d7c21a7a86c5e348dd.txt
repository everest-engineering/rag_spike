CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed woman with history of complex partial seizures, stroke, diabetes who presents with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Diltiazem, Lorazepam, Lisinopril, Dyazide, Fexofenadine, ASA
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening, but best seen over the left hemisphere with slight decrease amplitude over the right.  There is frontal central beta seen best over the left hemisphere also.  Overall there is attenuation of faster and normal frequencies of the entire right hemisphere, but maximally in the temporal and frontal regions.  The patient appears to go into drowsiness, stage I, sleep.
Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 frequently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At times they become rhythmic and sharply contoured.
Right hemispheric attenuation and decrease of faster frequencies.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemisphere attenuation and intermittent left anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In addition, the attenuation seen over the right hemisphere is consistent with a known stroke and cortical damage in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
