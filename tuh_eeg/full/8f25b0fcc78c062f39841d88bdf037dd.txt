CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old with history of HIV disease, renal failure, epilepsy, head trauma, waxing and waning mental status.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Baclofen, Vancomycin, Doxazosin, Azithromycin, Zosyn, Norvir, Enalapril, Metoprolol, famotidine, Nifedipine

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is noted to sometimes have a low blood pressure.  He is described as confused.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  Some sections are reasonably well organized, but others have a rhythmic frequency pattern.  There may be arrhythmic delta activity, frontal delta, or right hemispheric delta.  The bursts of delta or theta do not seem to correlate with behavioral changes for this individual and also seem to occur as he is resting comfortably.  The rhythmic or paroxysmal theta does not demonstrate frequency evolution.

Later sections of the long term EEG monitoring demonstrate less in the way of epileptiform activity.  There are portions of the record when the patient is awake, moving about.  Chew artifact is noted when he eats and these sections of the record are generally associated with an overall improvement.
