CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old woman with cerebellar posterior metastasis evaluated earlier this week for seizures with eye deviation to the right but an unremarkable EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Decadron, Lopressor, Decadron, Dilantin. Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is ventilated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG remains quite slow. The
frontal regions demonstrate some rhythmic theta, and there is a bit more delta in the
posterior regions. The delta in the right posterior region is slower and more featureless.
This record demonstrates variability and some sections demonstrate more theta than
others. The overall pattern is relatively low voltage, even when the patient Is somewhat
arousable with eye opening.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant background slowing, particularly posterior slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features identified. This EEG
supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.
The process may be more significant on the right compared to the left.
