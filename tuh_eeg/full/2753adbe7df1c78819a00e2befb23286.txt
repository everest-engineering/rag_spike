CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old woman with epilepsy at least since 2009, age 19, initially right temporal focus with more complex EEG pattern over time.  Previously treated with phenytoin.  Primarily with nocturnal seizures at this time.
CURRENT SEIZURE TYPE:  Nocturnal tonic/clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  This was a routine, outpatient, greater than 20-minute EEG.  It was a technically acceptable EEG aside from impedance of the T1-T2 electrodes which were somewhat elevated.  The patient had a recent headache and was somewhat drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta, and scant theta.  In addition, there is an asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity from the right temporal region with a relatively broad field.
The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep with abundant spindles.  She is falling asleep during hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
Interictal epileptiform discharges:  There are rare right temporal sharp waves and left frontal sharp waves.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage 2 sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate is 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
An excessively drowsy individual.
Nearly continuous right temporal focal slowing characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
Right temporal sharp waves.
Rare left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to the most recent EEGs, there is less epileptiform activity.  No polyspike activity was noted, and no central theta in wakefulness was noted today.
