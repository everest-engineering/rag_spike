History:	37 year old male with sz hx sine 8 - 9 years old.. Currently has 2 gtc sz with loc a week, lasting 1 - 2 min with return to baseline in 1 min. last sz 4 days ago.8-4-14 do eeg to try and obtain sleep


Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:


KEPPRA

Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. HR was 48

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and asleep stage 1. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
