CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman status post meningioma resection in 2008.  The patient has been suffering from insomnia, had a seizure following the 4th of July with some alcohol ingestion.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Ativan and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Technical criteria was satisfactory.  She has a breach rhythm in the right frontocentral region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Generous, frontocentral beta activity was noted.  A breach rhythm was noted in the right frontocentral region with accentuation of beta activity and some underlying, subtle focal delta.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the recording producing rhythmic frontal theta bilaterally.
Hyperventilation was followed by drowsiness with an increase in beta, particularly in the region with a breach and some shifting slowing primarily in the right central region.  Stage 2 sleep includes spindles, POSTS and some vertex waves and is a bit more symmetric.  The patient transitioned in and out of awake and drowsy state.  There is a bit of muscle or snoring artifact noted as well.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, which was better developed on the left compared to the right.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right central region, noted primarily in drowsiness.
Asymmetric driving response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are congruent with the previous right hemispheric resection.  The breach rhythm with the prominent accentuation of the beta activity is an anticipated finding, particularly for a patient receiving benzodiazepine.
