LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of complex partial seizures with last seizure reported in 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excessive diffuse beta is observed.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves are captured.
Hyperventilation produces a mild diffuse background slowing.
Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, the patient's sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with the patient asleep may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effects, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
