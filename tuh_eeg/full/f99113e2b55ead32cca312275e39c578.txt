AGE: 18 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE : 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1817
HISTORY :
18 y.o. male with a history of concussion referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events and memory issues.
MEDICATIONS : Lorazepam (ATIVAN) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth as needed for Anxiety (mother gives him her Rx).
SEDATION : None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and

fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
Â·background slowing are seen. Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy	routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
