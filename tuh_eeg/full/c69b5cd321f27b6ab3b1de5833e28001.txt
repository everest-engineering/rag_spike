CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old female with persistent vertigo, breast cancer, status post mastectomy 2 years ago with visual hallucinations and paranoia.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Meclizine, Lovenox.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Visual hallucinations.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  This patient has continued eye movement artifact throughout the entire recording and does not stop blinking throughout the recording, despite the technician telling her to stop.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.   Activating procedures, including hyperventilation, produce no abnormal discharges.   The patient is recorded only in wakefulness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES::  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
Note:  The continuous artifact impeded clear observation of all the frontal rhythms in this EEG and a repeated EEG with some sedation may aid in getting a better quality EEG if clinically desired.
