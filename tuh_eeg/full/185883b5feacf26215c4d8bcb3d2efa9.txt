CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 88-year-old woman with recurrent syncope.
I NTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG. This was a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. The patient is very drowsy and as she becomes drowsy there is excess background theta. The patient transitions in
and out of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles. Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rat: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG for a subject of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
