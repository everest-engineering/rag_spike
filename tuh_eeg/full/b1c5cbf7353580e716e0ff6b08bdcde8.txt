History:	34 year old man with poor mental status.

Of note, due to patient's size, the placement of some of the leads is off and
impedances of some of the leads are high.
Medications:	Versed drip
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of diffuse ~12 Hz low-to-moderate
amplitude activity with frequent eye blinking and eye flutter artifact.  No normal sleep architecture
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There are several brief episodes of
either right or left arm raising without an abnormal ictal correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake only portable 25-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction that in this patient at least partially medication induced.  There is frequent eye blinking
and eye flutter artifact without an abnormal ictal correlate.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
