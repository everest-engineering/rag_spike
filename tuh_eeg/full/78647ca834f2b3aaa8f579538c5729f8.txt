History:	73 year old man who presents with change in mental status change.  Patient has a
history of stroke with residual right sided weakness.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The
background over the right consists 9 Hz low amplitude alpha activity with preserved AP gradient.
The background over the left consists of polymorphic low amplitude 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly,
unstable AP gradient and overriding polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Sleep is characterized
by increase in diffuse theta activity and several waveforms resembling K-complexes.
No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, mild-to-moderate
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2, brief
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly asleep portable 23-minute EEG due to continuous focal
mild-to-moderate left hemispheric slowing. This finding is indicative of mild-to-moderate focal
cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
