Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation and accentuates the focal
slowing mentioned above.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left mid temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
