History:	46 year old woman with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Topamax, gabapentin and Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, and, especially, over the bitemporal regions.
No clear focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  A single left
midtemporal sharp transient is captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Additionally, patient has a brief episode of facial twitching (? Left only) that she develops during
photic stimulation.  She has another one after  the photic stimulation concludes.  These brief
episodes are not associated with an abnormal ictal correlate.  Patient also tells the technologist
Summary of Findings:
Sharp transients, one, left temporal, mid
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The single sharply contoured waveform in the left midtemporal region is of
unclear clinical significance.  Two brief episodes of facial twitching had no abnormal ictal correlate.
