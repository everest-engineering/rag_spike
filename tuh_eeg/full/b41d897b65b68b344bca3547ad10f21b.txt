Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity, intermixed with frontally predominant 10-11Hz alpha activity. There is absence
of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was
There is right periodic 1Hz epileptiform activity lasting 2-3 seconds maximal at F8 (anterior
temporal) with no evolution.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was stimulation reactivity and
spontaneous variability.  HR 95-100
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), right hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The presence of PLEDS is
suggestive of cortical irritability in the right hemisphere. Clinical correlation is recommended.  The
patient was placed on long term monitoring for further evaluation.
