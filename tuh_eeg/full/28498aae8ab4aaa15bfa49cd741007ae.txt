History:	40 year old woman who is comatose after cardiovascular  resuscitation.
Medications:	Dopamine, Vasopressin,  Phenylephrine, Fentanyl, Norepinephrine, Epinephrine, Insulin Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes,  comatose
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background is markedly attenuated and suppressed with only intermittent slow delta activity noted in the frontal leads.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate >120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL comatose 22-minute EEG because of marked diffuse slowing, background attenuation and lack of reactivity.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
