CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old with right-sided weakness, confusion and possible seizures. Previous evaluation for epilepsy in 2008 with left temporal sharp waves.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Pantoprazole, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is symmetric posterior dominant rhythm. In addition to a great deal of eye artifact, there is some subtle left temporal slowing. The primary area with rhythmic slowing is the left anterior temporal region. Unfortunately, artifacts preclude the definitive evaluation of sharp waves although there is some suspicious discharges at F7. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal theta.
2. Question suspicious left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activity was better in identified in 2008. The overall background is similar to previous studies.
