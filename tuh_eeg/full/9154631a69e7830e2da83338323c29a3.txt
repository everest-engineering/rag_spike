REASON FOR STUDY:  History of headache and left-sided weakness with a mass.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old man with a history of headaches and left-sided weakness for several weeks with a right thalamic mass.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some minimal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximal at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
There is also intermittent left frontal at F3 focal slowing and at times seen in rhythmic discharges over the frontal hemisphere where it becomes sharply contoured.
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen throughout the recording in wakefulness.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous right hemispheric focal slowing maximal in the anterior temporal region, in addition to independent left frontal focal slowing and generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction over the right hemisphere, maximal in the right anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known brain lesion, in addition to some left frontal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
