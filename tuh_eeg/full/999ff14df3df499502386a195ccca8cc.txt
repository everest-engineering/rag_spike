CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 40-year-old male with a new onset, recurrent seizures, shoulder pain and facial droop. Hx Ambien and Cocaine Abuse
MEDICATIONS:  Motrin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with brief stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation was performed with fair effort, producing an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not include a diagnosis of epilepsy and if further information is needed, a more prolonged study may be considered.
