CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed male with post traumatic headache; also with blanking out episodes.  Past history of left temporoparietal hemorrhage and chronic headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in rhythmic frontal theta.  Breach rhythm is suggested during hyperventilation with a little bit higher amplitude theta in the left frontotemporal region.  Features of drowsiness including increase in background slowing.  Features of drowsiness including increase in beta.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and there is a slight driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no focal neuro-epileptiform features identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude any diagnosis of epilepsy.  The breach rhythm identified is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.
