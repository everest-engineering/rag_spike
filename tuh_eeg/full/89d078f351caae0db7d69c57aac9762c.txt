History:	59 year old man with right sided weakness and aphasia, found to have left
ACA/MCA strokes.
Medications:	Keppra, coumadin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta and theta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate <60 bpm, with inter-QRS intervals up to 1.5 seconds.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left frontotemporal
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22 minute awake and asleep EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the
left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm, with inter-QRS intervals up to 1.5 seconds.
