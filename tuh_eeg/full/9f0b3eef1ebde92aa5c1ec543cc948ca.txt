CLINICAL HISTORY:   53 year old man with syncope and change in mental status. Past medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, multiple cardiac and pulmonary problems.
MEDICATIONS:   Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a background theta frequency of 4.5 to 7
Hz.  There is some frontal  delta
There are intermittent rare right frontal triphasic waves.  Again, see in the record is intermittent attenuation with theta waves.  The normal background is replaced with the theta waves.  Stimulation of the patient does not elicit a response.
HR:   96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background theta, intermittent attenuation.
2. 	Right frontal triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION: This is a nonspecific pattern that can be due to toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  Further clinical correlation is recommended.
