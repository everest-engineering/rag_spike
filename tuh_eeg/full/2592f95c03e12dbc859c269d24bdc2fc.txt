CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old male with sudden episodes of loss of consciousness for the past year.  The events occur 2 to 3 times per week.  Family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Vicodin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing with slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and POSTS followed by vertex waves.
Hyperventilation produced a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate is 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
