CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old gentleman with previous stroke, left-sided weakness with right carotid stenosis for right carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right hemisphere.  This is somewhat sharply contoured at times with a phase reversal at T4 and a field for the right-sided delta which is a bit more posterotemporal.  There is also some occasional arrhythmic delta on the left.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity most prominent in the right hemisphere.
Some sharply contoured slowing maximum at T4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG will be used for this patient's carotid endarterectomy baseline.
