REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old woman with recurrent left MCA infarcts, status post pial synangiosis, developed left subdural hemorrhage and was found to have epilepsia partialis continua with right arm shaking, twitching episodes.  This is a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is seen, this is nicely seen and is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta which is slightly higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent left mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal dysfunction in the left mid temporal region which is consistent with a known history of stroke and surgery.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
