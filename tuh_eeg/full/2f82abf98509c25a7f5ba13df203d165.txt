CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed female, diagnosis is status epilepticus followed by loss of memory. Chronic epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somewhat drowsy. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. In the transition to sleep, there is a subtle asymmetry with a small amount of theta in the right hemisphere particularly in the temporal region and some sharply contoured slowing. Wicket is also noted bilaterally in the temporal regions and there is a small amount of shifting and slowing in the temporal regions.
HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle, shifting slowing particularly in the temporal region.
2. Rare sharply contoured delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive sharp waves were seen. If epilepsy is an important consideration, additional EEG recording may be of use. There are no previous EEGs for comparison.
