CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old woman with nocturnal tongue-biting spells for the past 2-3 months.  Past history of tonic-clonic seizure in 2011 with head trauma.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is an awake and asleep record in a very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with generous vertex waves, K complexes and spindles noted in stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was falling asleep but did elicit a driving response.  Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record although the patient appeared to be excessively drowsy.  Of note, this patient had a previous EEG in 2011 after head trauma which demonstrated rare bursts of focal delta and theta from the left hemisphere.  This was not identified today.
