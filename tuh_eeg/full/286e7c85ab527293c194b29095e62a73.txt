CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed female with left temporal abnormality admitted with symptoms of disequilibrium, delirium, confusion, nausea, vomiting, headache. Evaluate for Lamictal toxicity versus break through seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Aricept, Metformin, Protonix, Zocor, Gabapentin, Lamotrigine, Lovenox, ASA, Singulair, Zocor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient is described as having a low blood pressure during the test. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and does appear to accentuate some subtle, left temporal focal slowing. In addition, hyperventilation produces rhythmic background slowing and then as the patient becomes drowsy with an increase in intermittent beta, intermittently, the left temporal rhythmic slowing is identified. POSTS are observed in stage 1 sleep. Interestingly, they are higher amplitude on the left than the right. Vertex waves and spindles are seen in brief stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving despite the fact that the patient is in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.

HR: 62 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal focal slowing noted pre, post, and during hyperventilation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEGs although no sharp waves were seen today and are relatively characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.
