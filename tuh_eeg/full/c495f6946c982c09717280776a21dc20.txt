History:	54 YR OLD  FEMALE WITH H/O SZ DISORDER, PRIOR H/O SZ. PRESENTS WITH
ONSET OF MULIT SZ
Medications:	PHENOBARBITAL, VIMPAT, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F7, F7/T3 and F8, F8/T4.  Intermittent left frontal F7/Fp1 rhythmic
theta/delta discharges that appears to organize and evolve for seconds and then stop with no
clinical correlate, this are concerning for subclinical seizures.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, intermittent, left frontal, electrographic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Sharp waves, frequent, bilateral frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent left frontal electrographic
seizures, this is supportive of an epileptogenic focus in this region.  In addition the intermittent
bilateral frontotemporal sharp waves are supportive of a distinct potentially epileptogenic foci in
those regions  Lastly there is mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
