HISTORY: An 81-year-old woman admitted on July 2, 2011, with right-sided weakness, slurred speech. P- stroke, epilepsy, left parietal encephalomalacia and gliosis as well as multiple infarcts.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Plavix, Aricept, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system or electrode placement EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG from the right hemisphere is well organized. The left hem essentially continuous arrhythmic delta activity with high amplitude sharp waves in the left, includes majority of epileptiform activity is anterior temporal. There is disruption of faster frequency activity compared to the right. Features of drowsiness include bilateral background slowing.
There is very high amplitude slowing on the left, typical of the same with a craniotomy defect.
HR: irregular, 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to
1 Nearly continuous focal slowing with high amplitude arrhythmic delta activity from the left hemisphere, particularly left temporal region.
2 Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
3 Disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are anterior to this patients most prominent areas of encephalomalacia and gliosis. The prominent focal slowing and sharp waves may be correlated her clinical history. Additional evaluation may be appropriate, where she is not so confused, correlating this EEG to an EEG at that time might be informative.
