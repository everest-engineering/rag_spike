CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman, admitted yesterday with hepatic encephalopathy, ammonia level of 200, this morning ammonia level down to 27.  CT with diffuse edema and hypodensity in the left parietal and occipital regions.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan drip, piperacillin, Zosyn, albuterol, fentanyl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the lab in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern with a mixture of delta and theta.  There were sections of the record when the patient had eye opening.
This EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  There are spontaneous arousals with a pattern rich in delta and theta frequency activity.  There are also sections of the record with much more slow delta.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.  There are rare triphasic waves.
Tactile stimulation of the patient produced an attenuation of the background.
A single left anterior temporal sharp wave was noted.
Heart rate:  100 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly abnormal background with a slow pattern.
A variable pattern sometimes with slow featureless delta, but with spontaneous arousals, although still a slow pattern.
Rare triphasic waves.
Intermittent attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described above is a nonspecific finding, but supports a diffuse encephalopathy.  The triphasic waves are compatible with a metabolic encephalopathy.
