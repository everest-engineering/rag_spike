CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old gentleman with stroke, epilepsy, prostate disease,
cancer, recurrent TIAs.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Seroquel, Protonix, Insulin, Protonix, Lovenox, Carvedilol,
Hydralazine, Zocor, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and
disorganized, relatively low voltage. There is some shifting asymmetries, bursts of
alpha frequency activity and delta. The delta tends to be a bit more posterior. The
burst of alpha frequency activity are approximately 9-10 Hertz and are seen in the
frontal region. Sharply contoured slowing is noted in the left parietal region. Discrete
sharp waves are picked up at C3-P3. Unfortunately there is also significant EKG artifact
in this same region.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity is seen particularly in the posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. There are no well-defined epileptiform activity. A repeat study in the lab when
the patient recovers may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
