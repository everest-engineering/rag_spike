CLINICAL HISTORY:	39 year old right handed woman with new onset epilepsy since February 2009 with frequent episodes with right arm shaking followed by amnesia.  Last seizure last week.  History of multiple TIAs.
MEDICATIONS: Primidone
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness,  the background EEG includes a somewhat slow background with an 8 to 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. 	Hyperventilation is performed early in the
record producing an increase in rhythmic slowing. Vertex waves are observed in stage I 	..
sleep.  There is some muscle artifact noted in the background. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:	96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Mild background slowing.
2. 	Mild background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. Correlating with imaging and clinical history is suggested.
