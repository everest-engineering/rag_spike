History:	55 YR MALE WITH NEW ONSET SZ GTC. CT B/L GLIOSIS FRONTAL LOBES R>L.
RIGHT CAUDATE INF.
Medications:	DILANTIN CHANGED TO KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  At time this appears monomorphic.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 56
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent focal slowing in the left
frontal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but likely related to his known trauma.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
