CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year old right handed woman with rheumatoid arthritis who
became agitated at MRI earlier today.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Galantamine, lipitor, Fosamax, omeprazole, Febuxostat
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient between
being agitated and snoring.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is lower voltage particularly
in the initial sections. There is a great deal of artifact. As the recording continues, more
of a beta pattern is followed by additional alpha theta frequency activity. Stimulation of
the patient produces a brief alerting.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Technically challenging EEG due to:
1. Low voltage.
2. Primarily beta frequency pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the clinical history, although there no
medications listed, this patient is likely to have been sedated with Additional
EEG monitoring as the patient's mental status improves may be of value
