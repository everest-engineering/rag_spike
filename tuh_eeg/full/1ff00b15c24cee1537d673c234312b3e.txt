CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old woman with childhood nocturnal seizures.  No other health issues.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  41-minute, digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with appropriate impedances.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Sleep was achieved.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Lateral rectus eye movement artifact was noted.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic central theta, and POSTS.  Brief stage 2 sleep included spindles.  Sleep was sustained during the EEG.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and did not significantly activate the record.  The patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation, but a vigorous driving response was achieved.
Heart rate 55 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, but for an individual with significant nocturnal convulsions, a followup study with more sustained sleep or even an overnight study may be informative.
