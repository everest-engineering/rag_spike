CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 13, stroke in 2008, left-sided weakness, migraine headaches, pituitary tumor and multiple neoplastic processes. Epilepsy with 2 tonic-clonic seizures last month as well as complex partial seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Topamax, Percocet, Nasonex, Albuterol, Flovent, Singulair

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10?20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record which produces some rhythmic slowing but it also produces rhythmic, sharply contoured, 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity from the left temporal region some of which has a well-defined left temporal sharp wave mixed in with it. The bursts of left temporal slowing are typically 3 to 5 seconds in duration, sometimes reaching 7 seconds. As the patient transitions into stage I sleep, there are a handful of left temporal sharp waves and just before photic stimulation, as she gets a little sleepier, there is a little bit more left posterior temporal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left temporal mixed theta delta.
2. Rare left temporal sharp waves.
3. Occasional mid to posterior temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are relatively characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy pattern. No seizures were recorded.
