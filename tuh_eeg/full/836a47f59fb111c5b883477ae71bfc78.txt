INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitored is performed in the unit.  No seizures were recorded by the nurse or the team during this section of the record.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized, high amplitude with intermittent portions of the record demonstrating higher amplitude rhythmic delta activity, particularly from the left frontocentral region.  There are portions of the record where there seems to be biologic, double phase reversing delta, which may be in part due to the patientâ€™s craniotomy.  In this sharply contoured background, there is epileptiform activity in the left frontal region and right central region.  In sleep, there are features of stage II sleep with spindles and K complexes as well as high amplitude poorly localized spike and slow wave or sharp and slow wave complexes, which are generally predominant in the frontal regions but not necessarily clearly unilateral.  There are also bursts of higher amplitude, almost fast activity identified in stage II sleep.  There are occasional left mid-temporal, as well as left central spikes seen in sleep.
HR:  60 BPM.
