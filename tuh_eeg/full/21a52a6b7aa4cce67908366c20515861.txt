History:	56 yo M, Sz disorder since age 9, pt sz activity lead to recent fall, SX in last year R
frontal/Central region,
PMHX- paranoid psychosis
Medications:	lamictal, Vimpat
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Frontocentral symmetric beta activity is also seen.  Excess diffuse
6-7 Hz theta activity is noted during wakefulness.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  HR is 70.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal EEG due to diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Occasional focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.
