INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with one-channel EKG. Hyperventilation
and Photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In wakefulness, the background includes 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but there is prominent, excess theta. In addition,
prominent sharp waves are noted particularly and the right temporal region T2. They are accentuated by hyperventilation.
Hyperventilation produces rhythmic slowing particularly from the right temporal region and the right temporal sharp waves.
Features of drowsiness including increasing beta. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep.
Just prior to the closure of the record, occasional sharp waves are noted from the left frontotemporal regions.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
