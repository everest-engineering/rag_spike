CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with subdural hematomas, hepatitis C, recurrent
craniotomies, complex partial seizures February 15, 2010 following craniotomy with seizures out of the left central temporal region. None reported since then.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Senna, Acetaminophen

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed. The patient has a tracheostomy and is on supplemental oxygen and is poorly
responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a medium to low
voltage pattern. The right hemisphere includes primarily a 6 Hz rhythmic background with a
smaller amount of alpha frequency activity and a suggestion of a theta frequency, posterior dominant rhythm. The activity from the left hemisphere is lower voltage, slower, although the posterior dominant rhythm is, on occasion, identified. Brief arousals in the record are associated with an increase in alpha frequency activity, right greater than left. There is occasional frontal delta left greater than right. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving, right greater than left. Heart rate 84 BPM. At the close of the record, asymmetric eye movement artifact is identified, again primarily in the left frontal region. There is a combination of eye artifact higher amplitude on the
left than the right and some left frontocentral slowing with occasional C3 sharp waves.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Interhemispheric asymmetry with lower voltage, slower activity on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized slowing and the focal slowing have been
previously described and support a bihemispheric process as well as a focal, structural process on the left involving gray and white matter. Epileptiform activity was markedly reduced today compared to previous studies. No seizures were recorded.
