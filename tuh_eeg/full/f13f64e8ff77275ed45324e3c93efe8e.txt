History:	24 YR MALE  WITH SEVERE MR AND SZS, CONGENITAL, FAMILIAL
MICROCEPHALY, SCOLIOSIS. WITH DROP ATTACKS LAST SZ 12/14/13  FROM
10/13 TO 12/13 PT HAD INCREASE IN SZS. BUT SEEMS TO HAVE SUBSIDED
Medications:	Per mom, she thinks Lamictal and Abilify
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  At times a frontal beta discharge can be seen intermittently. At times the discharges
are sharply contoured.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, Disorganized background
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The frontal predominant beta is of unclear significance.  No clear epileptiform activity was seen
