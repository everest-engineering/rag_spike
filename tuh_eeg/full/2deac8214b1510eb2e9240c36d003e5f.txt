CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman, who had an episode of right arm numbness followed by visual changes, which were evanescent.  His family doctor made a diagnosis of TIA and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, metformin, and Zocor.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta.
Notable in this record is nearly continuous somewhat irregular focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere, maximum in the central temporal regions seen in wakefulness and following into stage II sleep with spindles.  In this sharply contoured record, there is both sharply contoured slowing and rare sharp waves, maximum mid temporal region to posterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation produces an accentuation of the focal slowing.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate: 72 BPM
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
Focal slowing, nearly continuous from the left hemisphere when the patient becomes drowsy.
In this sharply contoured record, there are left temporal sharp waves, maximal in the posterior temporal or centrotemporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging and clinical history. An underlying structural or functional abnormality should be excluded.
