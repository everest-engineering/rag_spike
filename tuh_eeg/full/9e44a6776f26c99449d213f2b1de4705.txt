CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old male, resident of halfway house with traumatic brain injury.  Gunshot wound to the head 25 years ago, last seizure 2 weeks ago.  Poor historian.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, vitamin D, aspirin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.  This is an awake, technically acceptable EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is present bilaterally.  A breech rhythm is noted from the left with an increase in amplitude of that region.  In addition, there is intermittent arrhythmic delta activity in the left frontotemporal region.  Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and accentuated this finding.

In this sharply contoured record, with a breach rhythm, as the patient becomes drowsy, sharp waves are noted in the left mid and central temporal region.  There is also a rhythmic left frontal 3-5 Hz activity.

Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at intermediate flash frequencies.

Some of the most remarkable sharp waves or spikes noted in this record were seen either before after the photic stimulation.

Heart rate 90 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the left hemisphere, which may be characterized by rhythmic are somewhat rhythmic mixed theta delta from the frontocentral, frontotemporal regions and/or underlying arrhythmic delta activity.
2. Epileptiform activity from the left hemisphere in the context of a breach rhythm, which may be maximum at C3-T3 or more of a left frontotemporal maximum.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter as well as a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
