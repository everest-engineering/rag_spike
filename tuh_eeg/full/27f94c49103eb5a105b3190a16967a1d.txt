CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed woman with significant HIV disease, not yet on HAART, history of PCP pneumonia with 2 episodes of staring and stiffening. She also has a learning disability.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Vertex waves and spindles are observed in stage 2 sleep. Scant theta in noted in maximal wakefulness. Hyperventilation produces in an increase in slowing in the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. Scant theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen in this EEG nor in the previous study. The excess beta may be related to anxiety. The excess theta may be part of this patient's underlying cerebral atrophy or other CNS factors.
