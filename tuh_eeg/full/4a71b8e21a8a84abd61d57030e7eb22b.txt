AGE: 39 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/20/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only EEG #: 15-1710
HISTORY:
39 y.o. female with a history of anxiety and recent recurrent convulsions referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
ranitidine (ZANTAC) 150 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth 2 times daily.
risperidone (RISPERDAL) 1 mg tablet, alprazolam (XANAX) 1 mg tablet, clonidine (CATAPRES) 0.1 mg tablet, ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 800 mg tablet,
methadone (METHADONE) 40 mg disintegrating tablet, Take 40 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for Pain.
prednisone (DELTASONE) 20 mg tablet, 3 TABS ONCE DAILY FOR 3 DAYS, THEN 2 TABS ONCE DAILY FOR 3 DAYS, THEN l TAB ONCE DAILY FOR 3 DAYS. TAKE WITH FOOD.
clindamycin (CLEOCIN) 300 mg capsule, Take 1 capsule by mouth every 6 hours.
COMPRESSION GARMENTS (COMPRESSION GARMENTS), Wear daily as
instructed
Lidocaine-Hydrocortisone Ac (ANAMANTLE HC) 3-0.5 % Cream, Place 1 applicator rectally every 12 hours as needed .
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.	The patient was unable to fall asleep.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz 50 uV	posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake only routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake only routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
