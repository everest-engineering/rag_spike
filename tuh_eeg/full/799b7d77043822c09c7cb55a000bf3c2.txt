History:	61 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH PMHX SIG FOR SZ, ONSET OF SZ AT AGE
18, LAST SZ 2014 PT REPORTS 2 SZ. BOTH WITH LOC AND POSTICTAL
CONFUSION. PT NON-COMPLAINT WITH MEDS/ONLY TAKES WHEN HE FEELS
LIKE A SZ MAY HAPPEN.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the F7 region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
14&6Hz positive bursts
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
