History:	Bilateral carotid stenosis. Baseline prior to right CEA
Medications:	INSULIN, CLONIDINE, VITAMIN, ALPRAZOLAM, REPAGLINIDE, LISINOPRIL,
PLAVIX, ZOCOR, FUROSEMIDE, HCTZ, HYTRIN, ASA, TOPROL XL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional shifting slowing was seen as the patient transitioned into drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving. Wicket spikes were also seen during photic stimulation.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
