History:	81 YO FEMALE EVALUATION FOR SEIZURE FOLLOWING SURGICAL AORTIC
VALVE RECONSTRUCTION, POSSIBLE VALE REPLACEMENT ON 6/18/14. NO
SZ SINCE.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84 and has an abnormal atrial conduction.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent independent focal
slowing in bilateral midtemporal region..  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
