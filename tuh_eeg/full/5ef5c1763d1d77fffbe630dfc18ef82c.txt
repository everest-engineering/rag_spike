CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old right-handed woman with childhood epilepsy, recurrent as an adult with fatigue and now with intermittent, disabling, paroxysmal vertigo.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Keppra, simvastatin, aspirin, others, Ultram, Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Wicket was noted and the overall background is sharply contoured.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in background theta.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and increases the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response bilaterally.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Wicket activity is a normal finding in this record as is alpha squeak. This is a sharply contoured record.  This is the third EEG identified for this patient which did not identify sharp waves or spikes.  Additional studies may be performed to try and capture epileptiform activity.
