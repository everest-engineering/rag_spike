CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old woman with a history of absence epilepsy with increased frequency in the last two months.  The patient was on Tegretol and Dilantin, but concentration was zero.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed on the Long-Term EEG Monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric with a lot of muscle movement artifact.  There is a 10 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant rhythm with excessive beta activity.  In random sleeping, no seizures were observed and no epileptiform discharges were seen.  Sleep was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with a mixed frequency and rare vertex waves, spindles, and K complexes.
EVENTS:  The patient complains of several events and pushed the alarm button.
The first event was recorded at 18:48, but no seizure activity was observed on the EEG or on the camera.  Only muscle movement was recorded and the patient was awake and alert.
The second occurred at 21:23. Similarly, no seizure activity was recorded with no EEG correlate.
The third event occurred at 21:34, again with no seizure activity and with no EEG correlate.
The fourth event occurred at 05:07 when the patient woke up, but again no seizure activity.  The patient pushed the button and no seizures were recorded by the video camera and no EEG correlates.
HR:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal long-term EEG monitoring.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this long-term EEG record. Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If these “events” are not the patients’ typical seizures additional recording may provide further information.
