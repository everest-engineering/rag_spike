CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old woman with cerebral palsy, Dandy-Walker malformation, scoliosis, and encephalomalacia.  The patient was admitted May 1 with shortness of breath for 1 day.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, albuterol, prednisone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is recorded sitting up with supplemental oxygen.  Hyperventilation was not possible.
TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  As above.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an alpha rhythm of 9.7 Hz, 30 microvolts with generous low voltage frontocentral beta.  Prominent eye movement artifact was noted.  Scant frontocentral theta was noted in wakefulness.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow-rolling eye movements, an increase in beta, and a small amount of frontal slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 102 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep is remarkable for:
Scant excess beta.
Scant excess frontocentral theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's 3 previous EEGs were not available for comparison today, but no epileptiform features were seen in this EEG.
