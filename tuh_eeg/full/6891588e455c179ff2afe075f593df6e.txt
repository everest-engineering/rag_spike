HISTORY: 82 year old male with a previous stroke last year, right sided weakness,
heart failure, dementia, pacemaker, prior left MC Infarct now with acute right sided jerking.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lactulose
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG Is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system
of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive, but is
stimulated by the nurse.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG is abnormal and includes a glimpse of a
6 hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a background with excess beta and theta. There are
bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity and some sharply
contoured delta in the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions. These features of
drowsiness Include an increase in beta. As the recording continues, there is an increase in 10
hertz alpha activity and there is some sections. of the record as the recording continues where
there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm.
HR; 80 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing, improving over time.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. FIRDA.
4. Occasional left focal stowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were noted. This EEG supports a
diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a structural or functional process on the left
