History:	78 YO MALE POST SURGICAL FOR R/SDH WITH SHIFT.
PT R/O POSSIBLE SZ X 2 POST SURGERY.
HX: PT FELL AND DEVELOPED LARGE SDH.
Medications:	propofol drip, Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, drowsy, asleep
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity intermixed with beta on the left side with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Marked hemispheric differences with activity suppressed
on the right side. There were faster frequencies on the left side.  Eye blinks are asymmetric with
greater voltage on the right.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse
Attenuation, bilateral (R>L) diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Marked hemispheric asymmetry with suppression on the right side is consistent with a history of right
subdural hematoma.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
