CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old male with encephalopathy, CHF, hypertension, BPH, CKD, left PCA stroke, UTI, type I AV block that presents with confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while he was awake and agitated.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is abnormal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient appears to be awake during the recording.  There is no activating procedures performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen in the posterior anterior and mid temporal regions, specifically at F7, T3, and also F8 and T4.  At the same time there appears to be some fairly frequent focal slow waves seen at C3/CZ at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen very frequently throughout the recording.
There is mild excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves seen frequently in the left central region.
Independent bilateral temporal slow waves.
Mild diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left central region which may be related to a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of very intermittent focal slow waves in the bilateral temporal regions and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, but of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
