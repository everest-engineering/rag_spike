LASTING 20 MIN WITH BLURRED VISION.
PT TAKES EXTRA STRENGTH  TYLENOL.
Medications:	EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL

Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in
The left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
