History:	49 YR WOMAN WITH MULTIPLE SEIZURES LAST PM.  PMHX: LEFT ACA
ANEURYSM CLIPPED 2/15, POST BLEED WITH LEFT EYE BLINDNESS.
Medications:	 LORAZEPAM AND KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Diffuse, frontally
predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz
activity is present during wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta
activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the
left central and temporal region with a large variable that move anterior and posteriorly with a
frequency of 0.6Hz.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, left temporal, with a central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous periodic lateralized
epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in left temporal and central region.  These findings are indicative
of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion. In addition there is mild  diffuse
background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No electrographic seizures are present.
