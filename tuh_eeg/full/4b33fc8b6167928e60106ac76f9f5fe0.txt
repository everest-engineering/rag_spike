CLINICAL HISTORY:  46-year-old male, status post massive metformin overdose 1week ago.  Off sedation 48 hours, but with persistent coma, no longer triggering event.  Evaluate for coma.
MEDICATIONS:  Levophed, meropenem, Protonix, others.
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10- 20 system of electrode placement with 1channel of EKG. This is a technically somewhat challenging record for an intubated, comatose patient undergoing continuous hemodialysis dialysis at the bedside.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: Although the patient is comatose and unresponsive,the initial sections of the EEG demonstrates significant muscle or other artifact. Underneath this, there is a low voltage pattern with intermittent bursts of 2-3 seconds duration with mixed theta delta and then brief attenuation. The periods of attenuation are 2-5 seconds in duration.
Tactile stimulation does not appear to activate the EEG. Heart rate: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Technically challenging, but abnormal bedside portable EEG due to,
Apparent burst suppression pattern or at least an attenuation pattern.
Absence of significant reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This tracing, 6 days post severe CNS insult raises concerns regarding significant central nervous system pathology. Continuous video EEG monitoring will follow this study.
