:	24 year old man who presented with a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion in the
setting of severe HTN and pulmonary edema.
Medications:	Ativan, fentanyl
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation the background consists of a mixture of moderate
amplitude polymorphic theta, delta and some alpha activity.  The majority of the background
consists of low amplitude fast activity admixed with normal sleep architecture (vertex waves and K-
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 22-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but in this patient at least partially related to the medication effect.
