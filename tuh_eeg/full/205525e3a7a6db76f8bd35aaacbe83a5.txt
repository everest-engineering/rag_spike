History:	67 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SZS (AGE 1).
Medications:	TEGRETOL, KEPPRA, PROZAC, INSULIN, ASA, ALBUTEROL, LISINOPRIL,
PROTONIX, ZESTRIL, METOPROLOL, SINGULAIR,  PRILOSEC, ADVAIR,
NORVASC, INDERAL, ROBITUSSIN, REMERON, HCTZ
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. There is a fragmentary 6-7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  At times there is more
prominent, and higher amplitude intermittent delta predominantly in the frontal lobes suggesting
FIRDA.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, bilateral frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21 minute EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness because of diffuse
background slowing and FIRDA.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  FIRDA may be seen in the setting of increased intracranial
pressure or damage to frontal white matter.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
