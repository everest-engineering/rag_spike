History:	73 year old man with multiple events of left sided shaking and subsequently
decreased responsiveness.
Medications:	Versed, ativan x4, propofol drip, phosphenytoin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Voltages are diffusely very low.  The background consists of brief
bursts of monomorphic sleep-spindle-like activity, bursts containing frontally predominant
polymorphic theta and delta activity, intermittent brief bursts of bifrontal very low amplitude fast
activity and  periods of discontinuity.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Discontinuous background, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal portable EEG due to severe background slowing, attenuation, frequent
discontinuity.  EEG patterns indicate  severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction and are often seen in
sedated patients. Periods of bifrontal fast activity are of uncertain clinical significance but could
also indicate neocortical irritability.  Patient was placed on continuous long-term monitoring.
