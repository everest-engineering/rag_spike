CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed male with history of closed head injury 1.5 years ago, hypertension, blindness in the left eye, tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record in an individual who is a bit drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz, symmetric, reactive alpha rhythm.  Prominent wicket is noted.  In addition, the wicket is a little bit more remarkable on the left.
In maximal wakefulness the background EEG is symmetric, but in relaxed wakefulness there is an asymmetry with a bit higher amplitude theta on the left and a bit more prominent wicket on the left.
Brief vertex waves are noted in stage 1 sleep.  The patient is quite drowsy, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  The patient is asleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
An asymmetry in the amplitude and the prominence as stated in the left hemisphere in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features.  These findings have an intermediate correlation with a structural functional abnormality on the left.  Correlation with imaging is suggested.
