REASON FOR STUDY:  TIA
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old woman with a history of TIA in 2013, and a walker, with a history of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement  system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation with abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slowing seen independently at F7/T3 and F84/T4 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral independent temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
