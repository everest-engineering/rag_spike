CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old left handed woman with new onset tonic clonic seizure in association with psychiatric medications.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Neurontin, Fluoxetine, Metoprolol, HCTZ, Omeprazole, Simvastatin, Insulin

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves are noted in stage 1 sleep.  The patient transitions rapidly between wakefulness and sleep.  Brief epochs of stage 2 sleep are noted again with arousals. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and POSTS. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed.  Sleep deprivation may account for the rapid transitions in and out of sleep.
