Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 28 hours from 2AM on 02/15/2014 to 6AM on
02/16/2014.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw
EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes
in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the the attending

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Generalized frontally-maximal polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges
(GPEDs) occur with a regular repetition rate of 1 Hz. These become more prominent during the first
hours.  As the Vecuronium weans off the GPEDs develop an associated muscle artifact and
clinically the patient develops a rhythmic body jerk. This myoclonus varies in prominence with
intermittent Vecuronium use.  As the record progresses the GPEDs become less pronounced and at
2PM they subside and the EEG becomes entirely attenuated.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90 at time with PAC's.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 28 hour EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm. In addition to GPEDs.   These findings are suggestive of marked diffuse cortical
dysfunction and irritability, which in the setting of hypoxic injury portends a poor prognosis.  The
severe attenuation during the last hours of the record was discussed with the primary team.
