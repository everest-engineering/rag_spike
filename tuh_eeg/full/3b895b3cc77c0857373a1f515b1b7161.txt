CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old woman with colitis, abdominal pain and episode's of
shaking.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Naprosyn, Dilaudid, Mesalamine, Prednisone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized
with symmetric reactive 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Alpha squeak is noted. The patient is somewhat
drowsy and starts to transition into sleep. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the
record and produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation
does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
