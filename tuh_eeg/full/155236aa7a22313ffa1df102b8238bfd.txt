CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with 15 year history of epilepsy, 1-2 seizures a year with positive family history of epilepsy.  This is a repeat EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Tegretol, Zonegran, Klonopin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, as well as some rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG did not capture epileptiform activity.  Epileptiform activity may be more prominent around the time that the patient is having seizures and the previous EEG in June was a month after a cluster of seizures.
