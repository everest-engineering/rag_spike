History:	60 YO FEMALE WITH AMS. PMHX: COPD, HTN, DM, HPL, GERD, POST
HERETIC NEURALGIA. FOLLOW UP EEG TO R/O STATUS/SZ
Medications:	Propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal 1Hz sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording  .  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag and
are only present in clinical wakefulness or with tactile stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96  Facial twitching is noted
by the tech. The EEG reveals a myogenic artifact but no electrical correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Triphasic waves
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  The facial twitching had no
EEG correlate and may represent a subcortical myoclonus or alternatively may represent a simple
partial seizure which may only be seen on scalp EEG about 25% of the time.  Will place on LTM to
further evaluate discharges as sedation is removed.
