History:	63 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF ANEURYSM S/P REPAIR FROM LEFT PARIETAL
OCCIPITAL REGION IN 1981. PT RECENTLY HAS BEEN HAVING AN INCREASE IN
HEADACHES. THEY OCCUR IN THE FRONTAL REGIONS; WEEKLY.
Medications:	ASPRIN, DILANTIN, METOPROLOL, ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present at T3 during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, few, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
