CLINICAL HISTORY:  77 year old left handed woman, presents with a history of hypertension, diabetes and new right-sided weakness along with left gaze deviation that stopped while talking on the phone with daughter around 11 p.m.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Lipitor, Amlodipine, Hydrochlorothiazide, Metoprolol.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: There is a frequent amount of temporalis muscle artifact seen during the recording while in wakefulness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep stage 1 sleep is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 frequently at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 infrequently at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
bilateral independent anterior temporal slowing (left much more than right).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves (left more than right), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
