CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 17-year-old female, admitted on 24th for delivery.  Evaluated for eclampsia and fetal bradycardia.  The patient demonstrated seizure-like activity pre and post delivery.

MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, Phenergan, Nubian, morphine, magnesium, and Ativan.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the postpartum care unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was uncomfortable.  This was a technically acceptable EEG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized.  There is suggestion of a 6 hertz posterior dominant rhythm.  This background is disrupted by bursts of posteriorly predominant delta.  Occasional bursts of frontally predominant delta activity were also noted.  Brief stage 2 sleep included spindles and K complexes.

Heart rate:  126 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant background slowing in wakefulness.
2. Bursts of posteriorly predominant delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  These findings should be correlated with clinical history.  The bursts of posteriorly predominant slowing may be correlated with imaging and clinical syndrome.
