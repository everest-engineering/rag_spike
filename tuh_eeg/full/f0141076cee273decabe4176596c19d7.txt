CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman with renal failure, new onset seizures 1 month ago, now with metabolic encephalopathy and poor responsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, Seroquel, Keppra, Dilantin, Coreg, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent throughout.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background is a markedly abnormal pattern.  It is continuous, relatively symmetric with high amplitude, frontally predominant delta.  Superimposed upon high amplitude, chaotic and irregular pattern with occasional sharp waves.  There is some variability in the record and some sections demonstrate a lower amplitude pattern with some theta.  The patient is moving about throughout the EEG, but does keep the electrodes on and the overall quality is reasonably good.
The drowsy pattern is similar to the awake pattern.
Epileptiform seizures:  None.
Epileptiform abnormalities:  Sporadic sharp waves are noted from either hemisphere frontal or frontotemporal, sporadic.
HR:  90 BPM
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a previous study from July 2014.  The metabolic disorder may be the responsible for the triphasic waves.  The prominent epileptiform activity has been previously noted and may be mitigated by the underlying metabolic disturbances.
