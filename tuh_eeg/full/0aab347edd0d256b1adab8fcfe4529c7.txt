CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old with epilepsies following stroke in 2009.  Seizures began in 2010.  Seizure-free for the last 2 years.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, simvastatin, and Niaspan.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a tender softer rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  There is a modest asymmetry between the right and left hemispheres, which is relatively continuous and includes a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere particularly frontocentral and centrotemporal regions as well as a small amount of theta.  As the patient  becomes drowsy, there is a small amount of shifting delta slightly more on the right compared to the left.  POSTS were noted in sleep.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  The patient was transitioning in and out of stage 2 sleep during photic.  Stage 2 sleep is asymmetric with disruption of faster frequency activity in the central regions and asymmetric vertex activity.

Heart rate 90 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to
1. Essentially continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere particularly right frontal and central regions.
2. Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right including disruption of spindles and asymmetric vertex wise.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a 2nd EEG for this patient.  No epileptiform features were noted.  The focal slowing has improved.  The focal features described above are anticipated signs following a stroke.
