History:	76 year female who presents with worsening right sided weakness and dysarthria.
Patient has baseline right sided weakness and spasticity from prior left hemispheric
stroke and ICH.
Medications:	Tegretol, Baclofen
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Underriding fast activity is present in the left temporal
region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mild-to-moderate
Breach artifact, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy portable 23-minute EEG because of continuous
mild-to-moderate focal slowing in the left temporal region region.  This finding is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region and is consistent with a history of stroke and hemorrhage in the
left MCA territory.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  Breach artifact is secondary to a skull defect.
