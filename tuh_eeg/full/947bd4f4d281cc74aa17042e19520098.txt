History:	45 YO FEMALE IN IR FOR CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM W / COILING
COIL DEPLOYED LEFT SIDE X2 11:29
Medications:	REMFENT, PROPOFOL, VERSED, ISOFLURANE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As patient is sedated the background becomes discontinuous with
intermittent attenuation and later burst suppression.  The bursts consist of symmetric frontal maximal
beta/ alpha discharges slowing in frequency.  They occur about every 1-3 seconds lasting for 1-3
seconds. With less sedation the patient would arouse and move.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Study lasted 2hrs and 50minutes.
Incision at 10:17AM. A coil was deployed at 11:27AM and a second coil was deployed at 11:32AM.
No changes from sedated background were noted on EEG.
Summary of Findings:
Other, No changes
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful EEG during a cerebral angiogram and coiling. Any changes were conveyed to
the primary team.
