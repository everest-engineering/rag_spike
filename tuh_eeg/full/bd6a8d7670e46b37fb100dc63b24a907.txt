HISTORY: 52 year old right handed male status post temporal lobectomy
many years ago at Graduate Hospital, seizure free until approximately 7 months ago,
now with recurrent seizures with foaming at the mouth.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown , Tegretol
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 10.5
Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal
central beta. Subtle, underlying rhythmic right temporal 4 Hz activity with rare delta is
noted. in wakefulness and in the transition to drowsiness. There is a subtle breech
rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is a bit more prominent on
the left compared to the right.
HR: 78 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle, right temporal focal slowing with rhythmic theta and slight slowing of
faster frequency in that region.
CLINICAL These findings are similar to a previous study on July 14,
2010 and are congruent with a history of right temporal lobectomy. There are no focal
features outside of the region of the right temporal lobe.
