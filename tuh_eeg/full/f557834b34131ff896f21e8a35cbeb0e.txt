History:
69-year-old man with a history of seizure disorder sip left craniotomy and left frontal gliosis presents with break  through seizures ( fall from roof and broke his right arm on 9/3/2013).
Medications: Keppra, Spiriva. Venlafaxine
Sedation:
None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, comatose. photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-30uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, Which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is excess 6-7Hz theta activity during wakefulness. Frontocentral beta activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent.
Almost continuous polymorphic delta and theta activity is present in the left temporal region (F7/T1) during wakefulness. Increasing during drowsiness. Occasional focal sharp waves are present in the left temporal region. There is left frontotemporal breach rhythm.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Abnormal EEG
Interpretation:
This Is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of Diffuse theta activity during wakefulness is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Almost continuous focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. Occasional epileptiform discharges in the left temporal region. These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. Breach rhythm is consistent with
a history of craniotomy.
