CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed male, with recurrent loss of consciousness, occasional binge problems, memory problems, blurry vision, anxiety, depression and left arm weakness.

MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Risperdal, Trazodone.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient reported feeling unwell, experiencing "dizziness and disillusion" as if he is overheated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by disruption of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves.
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If the patient was experiencing his typical neurological symptoms during this EEG, it may not be necessary to conduct any additional evaluation.
