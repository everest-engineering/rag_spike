History:	23 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O REPORTED EVENTS OF
UNRESPONSIVENESS AND SZ ( ONSET 4/12) , GIVEN SEDATION, FOUND TO BE
ANEMIC, FEBRILE AND POSS. HEMATOMA. PT SZ HX IS 6 IN THE LAST 8
MOS. POSTICTAL/LETHARGY THAT LAST SEVERAL DAYS. PMHX SIG FOR
Medications:	REGLAN, CEFEPINE, TOBRAMYCIN, PROTONIX, KEPPRA, LASIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 14 hours from 01/07/2014 to 01/08/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG
was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. They
occur at about 1-2 Hz throughout the record.  These appear to be state dependent.  No normal
sleep architecture was present. However the triphasics stop and there is a diffuse delta background
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
