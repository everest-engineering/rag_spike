CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old right handed male with kidney transplant, memory impairment, and hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS: Acyclovir, Aricept, CellCept; Lisinopril, Pravachol, Metoprolol, Benadryl, Prograf, Rapamune, Prednisone, Trimethoprim/Sulfa, Nystatin, ASA

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow, at best reaching an alpha rhythm of 6.5 Hz; but when the patient relaxing and drifting off into sleep or under-stimulated, more of a 4 Hz pattern. There is a small amount of 2 Hz delta activity and rare P3 subtle focal delta.

HR: 60 bpm with broad QRS complex.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Very subtle superimposed occasional left posterior slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, which may be attributed to this patient's medications or chronic CNS processes. There were no epileptiform features noted.
