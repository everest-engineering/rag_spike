CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old gentleman status post AVM rupture in 2005 with 30 day hospitalization, right-sided weakness and trembling, past history of an aura of a circular feeling in the left eye and feet.  Now with an episode of loss of consciousness during the heat.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, hydrochlorothiazide, Lotrel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is occasional shifting slowing noted in the right or left centrotemporal region.  Bursts of mixed theta delta can be noted, typically lasting a second or two.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate some of this particularly right posterotemporal, left frontocentral.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by rhythmic background slowing.  Again, shifting slowing was noted.
Hyperventilation seems to accentuate some of the underlying slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.  Heart rate 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG in wakefulness through brief stage 2 sleep due to:
Shifting asymmetries, particularly right posterior quadrant and a little bit more remarkable left frontotemporal.
A suggestion of a breach in stage 2 sleep with vertex and spindles that are slightly asymmetric in amplitude.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  In contrast to an EEG 2 years ago, no right-sided sharp waves were noted.  This EEG demonstrates some slowing from either hemisphere.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  The bradycardia may be evaluated clinically.
