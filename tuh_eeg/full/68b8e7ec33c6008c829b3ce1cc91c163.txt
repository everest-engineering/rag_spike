History:	26 YEAR OLD PT PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ AS A CHILD. PT HAD BEEN SZ FREE
FOR 2 YRS, SEEN HERE ON 10/15/12 IN ED FOR SZ, RT SIDED SHAKING 1-2
MIN WITH TONGUE BITING, LOC AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION. FOLLOW UP
EEG - LAST SZ IN NOV 2014
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild excess theta in wakefulness.  This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
