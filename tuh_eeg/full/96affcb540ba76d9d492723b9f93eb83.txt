Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During limited stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving..
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep 1 hour EEG because of intermittent focal slowing
in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
