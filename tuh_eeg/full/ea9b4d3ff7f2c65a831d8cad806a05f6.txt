History: 38 YR MALE WITH HEAD TRAUMA 1995/?COMA/ SINCE THEN HAS HAD
EVENT SZS. GETS SEVERE PAIN, LOCI WAKES UP IN HOSP. (NO OTHER INFO)
GIVEN DILANTIN ON D/C HOSP 1995. PER PT HAS HAD 8 SZS SINCE TBI.
DEPRESSION, HEADACHES. HEAD 59 CM
Medications: Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, hyperventilation, photic
DESCRIPTION: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV. 11-12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV 18-25Hz activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation. and produces mild diffuse symmetric bad<ground slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 121 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR:80 BPM.
Summary of Findings:
Normal EEG
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
