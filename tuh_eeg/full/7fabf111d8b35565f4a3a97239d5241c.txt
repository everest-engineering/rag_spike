Medications:	DEPAKOTE,  VENLAFAXINE, LORATADINE, ASA, LOVENOX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at best 8 Hz. .  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity at time with more organized anterior to posterior
gradient.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely,
followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Almost continuous F8/T4 focal slowing is present.  Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs) are present in the F8/T4 region at a rate of 1 Hz.  In two occasion these appear to increase
in frequency and suddenly stop. These lasts for around a minute and there is no clear clinical
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, Electrographic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  two electrographic seizures arising from the right anterior
temporal region. In addition the  continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs)
are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the right
anterior temporal region. Lastly there is  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
