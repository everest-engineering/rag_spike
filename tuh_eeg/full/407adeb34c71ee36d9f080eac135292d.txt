CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old right handed male with brain mass and seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Decadron, Oxycodone, Dexamethasone, Protonix, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake but somewhat confused. Ativan is given during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The left hemisphere is somewhat slow with an alpha rhythm of 7 Hz but overall relatively rhythmic pattern. The right hemisphere demonstrates continuous arrhythmic slowing, with sharply contoured activity at T6, C4 and P4. There is an increase in amplitude overall. With the use of an average reference, the high amplitude delta in the record demonstrates a phase reversal. Using the average reference, the average is more negative than O2 and T6 with a positivity at P4. As the recording continues, high amplitude spikes are seen again in the right parieto-occipital region. Although this spiking and the focal slowing are quite prominent, they do not evolve into seizures. In this confused individual, an Ativan challenge is given at 9:33a.m. This does not significantly blunt the epileptiform activity on the right nor slow the activity on the left.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION/ CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is abnormal due to continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere particularly in the posterior region. Epileptiform activity in the right.
