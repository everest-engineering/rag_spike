EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates with eye
opening with an asymmetry in amplitude, decreased and at times interrupted on the right.  Frontal
18-25Hz activity is present with a voltage asymmetry and decreased amplitude over the right
hemisphere.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the central
region at C4.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region at
T3.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was

Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
hemisphere maximal in the central region. This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral
dysfunction in this region, likely involving cortex and consistent with the known atrophy and stroke.
In addition there is evidence of  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or
