CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 82-year-old male, taken to the emergency room for a possible status epilepticus with facial and eye twitching.  Past history of stroke with chronic right-sided weakness, prior chronic left MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone, Motrin, Dilantin, aspirin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage and relatively slow.  From the left hemisphere, it is relatively slow, lower voltage and featureless.  The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent, slower somewhat more prominent 2 hertz delta.  Occasional bursts of FIRDA were noted.
Stimulation of the patient produces eye movement, but the patient remains relatively drowsy.  As the patient transitions in and out of wakefulness and sleep, occasional attenuations were noted.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing in a low-voltage pattern.
Somewhat more attenuated pattern on the left.
Occasional bursts of rhythmic delta noted from the right.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  The features in this record suggest a chronic encephalopathy including the generalized attenuation.  No epileptiform features were seen.
