CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old male with epilepsy with 1 to 2 seizures per day with eye fluttering and arm stiffness.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Trileptal, Depakote, Tolpyrramide, Prozac
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. Photic stimulation is performed but there is no hyperventilation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow without some of the normal morphologies of an adult awake EEG. Arrhythmic delta is noted in the right temporal region and the right anterior temporal spike and slow wave and sharp and slow waves complexes are noted as is some fast activity with almost a 4 Hz right central spike and slow wave complex. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with an accentuation of focal slowing at C4 and F8. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 61 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right affecting gray and white matter. This EEG is similar to prior studies.
