History:	29 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS ON 6/9/14 WITH H/O STROKE  AT THE AGE OF
7 YEARS OLD. PT TEXTED HER FATHER AND SAID SHE FELT WEIRD AND
THEN WAS TAKEN TO ED.
Medications:	Keppra, Lorazepam, Warfarin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal (F8) region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 80.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
