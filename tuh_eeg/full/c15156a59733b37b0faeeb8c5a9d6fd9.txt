CLINICAL HISTORY:	32 year old male with profound mental retardation, severe behavioral problems, currently seizure free.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Ativan, Seroquel.


INTRODUCTION:    Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system  of electrode  placement  with  1 channel  of  EKG. .

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage beta frequency pattern with scant alpha rhythm. Sleep was not achieved.

HR:	104 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with primarily a beta frequency pattern.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  If epilepsy is important, a repeat study could be considered, but typically this individual has great difficulty participating in studies.   This likely represents the best possible EEG for him.
