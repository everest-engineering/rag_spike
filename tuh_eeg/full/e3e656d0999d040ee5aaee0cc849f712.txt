CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right handed male with refractory right temporal lobe
seizures.
MEDICATIONS; Dilantin, Flecainide, Crestor; ASA, Diovan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was completed. Photic stimulation was deferred. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm present bilaterally. Features in wakefulness and accentuated in drowsiness include intermittent rhythmic theta and delta activity from the right temporal
region as well as high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave, sharp and slow wave complexes. These can be identified in wakefulness. Both the focal slowing and the sharp waves are accentuated in drowsiness. Other features of sleep include
vertex waves and POSTS. Photic stimulation is remarkable for the appearance of the
right temporal sharp waves and scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temporal spike.
2. Slow and sharp wave
3. Slow wave complexes.
4. Right temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been identified on previous studies
and support a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. They are relatively classic in
terms of other characteristics of temporal lobe epilepsy.
