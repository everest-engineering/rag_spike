CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed woman with syncopal episode with pain in the face, lip, and eye associated with poison ivy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, ASA, Norvasc, Zocor, Augmentin, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in slowing in the background.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic slowing followed by vertex waves and posts.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response as well as lambda.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be valuable.  There was a small amount of shifting slowing noted in hyperventilation, but this is not outside of the range of normal for age.
