History:	32 year old woman with an episode concerning for a seizure.

Patient has a weave, so some electrode placement distances and impedances are
not accurate.
Medications:	N/A
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of <60 bpm.  Of note,
patient has a weave, so some electrode placement distances and impedances are not accurate.
