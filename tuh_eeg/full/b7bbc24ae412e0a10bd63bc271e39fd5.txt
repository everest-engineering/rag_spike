History:	51 y.o. male p/w altered mental status.  CC: metastatic NSCL w/ brain mets s/p
resection 8/23/13 temporal crani. recently had another left posterior crani in
9/2014. pt had last sz on Sat.  EEG at OSH keppra was increased has not had any sz
Medications:	Keppra, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. At times it is slightly disrupted on the left.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of
beta activity and amplitude on the left consistent with a breach.  Rare focal sharp waves are present
with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at T3.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left generalized,  maximal in the midtemporal region
Sharp waves, rare, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of rare epileptiform discharges in the left
midtemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal region region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
