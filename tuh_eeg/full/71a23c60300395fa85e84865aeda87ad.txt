CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed male with a history of head trauma, hit by a car at age 13, skull fracture, orbital fracture, prolonged coma treated at Seashore House. Now with episodes of staring and loss of memory.
MEDICATIONS: Haldol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm. There is frequent eye blink and generous beta. There is a suggestion of breech rhythm in the frontal regions with some head rocking artifact. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and there does seem to be a skull irregularity noted at F8 during hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by vertex waves, but slight asymmetry of the vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. In later sections of the record, as the patient starts to transition in and out of sleep, there is some irregular sign in the frontotemporal regions.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small amount of shifting slowing in the frontal regions bilaterally.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. Comparison with this patient's imaging is suggested. If this individual continues to have frequent events, an EEG monitoring session may be of use.
