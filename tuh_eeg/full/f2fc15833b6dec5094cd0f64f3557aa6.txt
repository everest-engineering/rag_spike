CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old woman with a long history of refractory spells, cervical myelopathy, right-sided weakness now with crescendo seizures.  The patient states that not all seizures are stress related and she feels that she cannot get them under control.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine outpatient digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred due to the patient's pulmonary condition.  This is an awake and asleep record in a patient, who is very drowsy, dropping in and out of stage 2 sleep and falling forward to sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the posterior dominant rhythm slows.  In the transition towards sleep, there are intermittent bursts of rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere.  Features of stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Multiple sleep arousals were noted.
The early section of the record demonstrates mu, but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep, but did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Intermittent rhythmic slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  At the time of this dictation, previous studies were not available for comparison.  For this individual with significant atherosclerosis risk, additional evaluation may be of use.
