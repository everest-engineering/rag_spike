History: 56 YO MALE WITH HISTORY OF SEIZURES, LAST SEIZURE IN JUNE 2013 WITH
STIFFENING OF BODY AND INCONTINENCE LASTED 1 MIN.
Medications: Tegretol, Pravachol
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10·20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. Awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 2$-40uV, 7.5-8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions. There are excess 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.
No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1·21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates from1 to 21 fps. HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect. This is an abnormal EEG due to diffuse background slowing and slow alpha. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The tack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
