Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes

DESCRIPTION
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Alpha rhythm and background activity are low voltage (10-25uV), and mild slow at 8HZ No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.

Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present In the left region during wakefulness. increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Summary of Findings:


Interpretation:
This Is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.
This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is mild background
slowing. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
