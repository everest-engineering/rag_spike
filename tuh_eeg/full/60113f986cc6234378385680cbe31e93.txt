CLINICAL HISTORY:   23 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, schizophrenia.  Primary care doctor thought that the patient was pregnant and stopped her Topamax, but the patient states that it turned out that she was not.  She continues to have seizures every 3 weeks.  Last seizure required emergency room care.  The patient had a subtherapeutic Dilantin level at that time.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Abilify, Trazodone
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  In relaxed wakefulness, there are high amplitude left anterior temporal sharp and slow wave and spike and slow wave complexes with a generous field of spread throughout the left hemisphere.  In addition, there are a handful of more subtle F3 sharp waves and rare right mid temporal sharp waves.   Both hyperventilation and drowsiness accentuated the epileptiform activity.  Bursts of high amplitude spike and slow waves complexes may occur in pairs.   Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS with rapid transition in and out of stage 2 sleep. In more prolonged stage 2 sleep there are bursts of mixed focal slowing from the left temporal region and high amplitude spikes. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left high amplitude left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.
Additional sharp waves at F3.
Rare right T2 sharp waves.
Left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to 2 previous studies.  No seizures were recorded.  Additional clinical evaluation may be necessary to achieve seizure control for this patient.
