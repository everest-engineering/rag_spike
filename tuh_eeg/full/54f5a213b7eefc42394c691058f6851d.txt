CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old male, admitted to the hospital in early February with 2 weeks of confusion and language difficulty, found to have repetitive seizures.  Previous phenytoin toxicity.  Evaluate for delirium.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, nifedipine, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively confused, but followed commands and complained of abdominal pain.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a clearly defined, 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Shifting arrhythmic delta was noted as were bursts of more rhythmic, frontally predominant slow delta.  The patient answers questions, follows commands, and with alerting, there is an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically somewhat challenging routine 20-minute EEG at the bedside, but is remarkable for:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
Rhythmic delta.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted today.  No seizures were recorded.  Overall, this EEG is most compatible with a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
