CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 20-year-old woman with intermittent episodes of left arm shaking, which is prolonged and persistent.  Relieved only by sleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, although the patient was drifting off to sleep.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
Clinical Correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing the patient's clinical spells may be of value.
