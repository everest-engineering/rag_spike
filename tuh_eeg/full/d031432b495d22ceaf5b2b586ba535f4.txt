CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed gentleman with hypertension, epilepsy
and schizophrenia, no report of seizures provided to date. The patient is thought to be
seizure free.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote, Geodon, Cogentin, Nifedipine, Lisinopril, HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
somewhat slow alpha rhythm with 7.8 hertz with a small amount of background theta.
The patient appears to be quite sleepy, drifting off to sleep, but the tech stimulates the
patient to make sure that she gets adequate wakefulness. Other features of drowsiness
include a pattern of diffuse beta. Vertex waves are noted in stage 1 sleep.
Hyperventilation is not successful. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is
asleep and does not elicit a driving response.
HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were identified in a previous study. Neither
of this patient's 2 EEGs have identified epileptiform activity.
