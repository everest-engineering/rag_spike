TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is asymmetric, but	reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by an asymmetric and reactive 9.Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which is disrupted on the left.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not sustained
Left sided focal slowing is present; characterized by a disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere,
more prominent in drowsiness with disruption of the alpha rhythm. As the patient become sleepier, irregular mixed theta delta is noted in the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Low to medium amplitude, history sharp waves are noted at TS and Fpl;	these are intermittent
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: Elicits an asymmetric driving response, better developed on the right
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is	an abnormal routine outpatient 20 minute EEG.
#1 left temporal focal slowing most prominent in drowsiness.
#2 subtle sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including left frontal or mid to posterior temporal
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is	the fourth EEG for this adult.	The focal slowing and epileptiform activity have been identified in previous EEGs.	In comparison to previous studies, the focal slowing and epileptiform activity is not as prominent today.
