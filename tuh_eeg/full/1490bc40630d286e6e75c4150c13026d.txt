CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old male with complex congenital cardiac disease and bilateral watershed infarcts after near cardiac arrest with past history of abnormal EEG with left occipital sharp waves.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an almost exclusively stage II sleep in a patient who appears to be quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak was noted with stimulation.  The majority of the EEG includes stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
The patient was stimulated for photic stimulation, but drifts back into sleep.  Scant driving was noted.
Heart rate 66 bpm, infrequently irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG, almost exclusively in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The previous EEG, which demonstrated occipital sharp waves was not available for comparison today.
