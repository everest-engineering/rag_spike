LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 28-year-old woman with a past medical history of cerebral palsy, now status post insertion of baclofen pump, who had 2 episodes of brief confusion on 01/08/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Baclofen, benztropine, Lexapro, ciprofloxacin, Celexa, Zofran, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at high rate flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 24-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
