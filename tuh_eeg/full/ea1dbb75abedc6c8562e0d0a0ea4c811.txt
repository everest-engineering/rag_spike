History:	58 year old woman with a reported history of seizures since -1985. Medications:	Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Background voltages are low.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low voltage beta activity that attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV,  18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  The majority of the background consists of low amplitude diffuse beta activity.   During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.   Frequent positive sharp waves occur bilaterally and independently in the occipital regions during drowsiness  and light sleep.
Occasional low voltage sharp waves are seen over the left fronto-temporal region (Fp1/F7/F3). A benign variant (BETS, benign epileptiform transients of sleep) cannot entirely be excluded.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate 54 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 1-hour awake and asleep EEG due to: 1. Left frontotemporal sharp waves (Fp1/F7/F3). While these sharp waves are most likely epileptiform, a benign variant (BETS) cannot entirely be excluded. Of note, low voltage backgrounds are a benign variant in the adult population.
