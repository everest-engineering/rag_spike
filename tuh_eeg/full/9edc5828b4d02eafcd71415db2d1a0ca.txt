History:	81 YR MALE WITH  PMHX; OF CARDIAC CODE 6/13. CPR PERFORMED BY
FAMILY (ALL IN MED FIELD) DOWN 10 MIN.  PT HAD SZ ALSO AT THIS TIME..
PMHX: HTN, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, CVA 2012 LOSS PERIPHERAL VISION X 6MONTHS .
NEURO EVAL (OUTSIDE HOSP EEG RESULTS IN CHART)
Medications:	KEPPRA, AMLODIPINE, ASA, ZOCOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The background reveals excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz
activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, and slowing of  PDR
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
mid temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition there is mild diffuse slowing and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
