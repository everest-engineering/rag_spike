History:	60 YO FEMALE WITH AMS. PMHX: COPD, HTN, DM, HLP, GERD, POST HEPATIC
NEURALGIA. FOLLOW UP EEG TO R/O STATUS/SZ
Medications:	Propofol stopped on 03/22/2014.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 42 hours from 03/21/2014  to 03/23/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  The background improved during the last 12 hours with more theta and at times
anterior faster frequencies with some organization.  Diffuse, frontally maximal 1Hz sharp waves with
triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording  .  These waveforms demonstrate an
anterior to posterior phase lag and are only present in clinical wakefulness or with tactile
stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Triphasic waves
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
