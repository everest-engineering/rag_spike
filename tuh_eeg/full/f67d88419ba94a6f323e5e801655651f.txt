CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old woman with a long history of epilepsy. Recently, she was
hospitalized this past Saturday for a blood transfusion and reports that she had a cardiac arrest
on Saturday. Last seizures was 4/10/2010, and is complex, partial in nature.
MEDICATIONS: Zonegran, Phenobarbital, Nortriptyline, Flexeril, Temazepam, MS-Contin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10á20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed. Hyperventilation
was deferred.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates
rhythmic slowing with primarily a combination of 4 Hz, 6 Hz and 8 Hz activity. In wakefulness,
there is a subtle underlying T1 sharp wave noted. There is also a small amount of shifting
arrhythmic delta activity. Features of drowsiness include an Increase In rhythmicity of the
background followed by vertex waves. There is shifting arrhythmic delta activity in the temporal
regions particularly as she drifts Into sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent rhythmic theta background.
2. Occasional shifting arrhythmic delta.
3. Questionable left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's medications may play a role in the pattern described
above. The rhythmic slowing can be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy
or medication effect. The arrhythmic delta activity in an adult of this age is a nonspecific finding.
Additional EEG recording may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
