REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while drowsy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Versed.
HISTORY:  A 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, depression, anxiety, and a possible heart condition with seizures and CT scan with a finding of a right occipital hypodensity, possible stroke.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is an excessive diffuse beta present and the background appears to be of continuously low amplitude.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate 96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
