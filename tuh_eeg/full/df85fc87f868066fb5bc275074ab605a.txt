CLINICAL HISTORY:  84 year old right handed woman with previous left MCA stroke, status post TPA a month ago, small right MCA stroke, atrial fibrillation, now complaining of left sided headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Cardizem, Protonix, Tylenol 3, Senna, Synthroid, ASA, Gabapentin, Lovenox, Hydralazine, Zofran, Ondansetron
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 8.5 to 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  As the recording continues, the patient is a little bit more alert and the alpha increases to 10.5 Hz.  The patient is initially somewhat drowsy.  In the transition in and out of drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of shifting slowing, a bit more so on the left than the right.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  Rare spindles were observed. Photic stimulation was remarkable for significant artifact with minimal driving.
HR:    96 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within the normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen.  The patient seemed to be quite drowsy.  This may have been related to her current medical scenario.
