HISTORY:
A 34-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy which began at age 2. Characteristics of seizures are unknown. She had
recent sleep deprivation and dental infections. She had a seizure witnessed by her boyfriend some weeks ago, which
was tonic-clonic in nature and was admitted after having been found incontinent and confused on July 7, 2011.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In apparent wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The background is intermittently disrupted by bursts
of frontally predominant, paroxysmal delta.
Hyperventilation also seems to accentuate this as well as some focal slowing with additional focal deltas in the left
hemisphere and disruption of faster frequency activity on the left. As the patient transitions in and out of stage I sleep,
the alpha rhythm drops out earlier on the left in comparison to the right. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
An abnormal EEG due to
1.
Bursts of bilateral, paroxysmal slowing and wakefulness.
2.
Focal features, which include an asymmetric hyperventilation response, sharply contoured slowing and
hyperventilation, and an asymmetry as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The bilateral paroxysmal features can be part of a postictal pattern, but the left focal feature is suggesting focal
mechanism for epilepsy.
