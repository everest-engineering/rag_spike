LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with extensive coronary artery disease who now presents with 7 to 10 days of episodes of passing out.  Of note, while she was in the doctor's office she was observed to have right arm shaking, followed by eyes rolling back and then loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Plavix, aspirin, Singulair, Keppra, Ativan, isosorbide, metoprolol, Lipitor, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Lambda waves are occasionally captured.  During sleep, vertex waves, sleep spindles, K complexes, and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.  A regular rate is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
