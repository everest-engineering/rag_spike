CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male with multiple strokes. The patient was admitted with the 3rd stroke-like episode with twitching of the left-sided face with dizziness, numbness. MRI negative for CVA Past history of bipolar disease, schizophrenia.  Scalp lipomas
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, metformin, Oxycodone
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. It is a technically satisfactory EEG aside from some impedance issues with the T1 and T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of theta.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Minor asymmetries were noted in the EEG both in hyperventilation and stage 2 sleep with very subtle, disruption of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 60 BPM
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due to subtle focal slowing characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity on the right in hyperventilation and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The focal features are of unclear clinical significance, particularly given the large scalp lipoma
