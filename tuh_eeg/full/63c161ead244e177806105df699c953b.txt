CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, currently seizure free but now reporting impaired memory 1 or 2 times per month. Prior occipital or temporal sharp waves
MEDICATIONS: Flovent, Levetiracetam, Zetia Alendronate, Zonisamide, Lovastatin Ranitidine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  This is followed by an increase in beta.  Sleep is not sustained and there is a fair amount of muscle noted in the EEG as the patient becomes drowsy.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Electroencephalogram within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features are identified in the EEG today.  The patient seemed to have difficulty falling asleep.  Activating procedures did not produce spike and wave activity.  Additional evaluation for the patients memory lapses may be appropriate. Additionally, a more prolonged EEG monitoring session to capture one of the memory lapses may also be of value.
