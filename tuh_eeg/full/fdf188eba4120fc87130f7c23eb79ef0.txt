CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old right-handed male with stroke in 1993, started on Keppra in 2013, but the patient states he never had seizures.  Recurrent stroke in 2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in frontocentral beta.
Focal slowing is noted with shifting asymmetries, some of which is a bit more prominent in the right posterior region than the left.  Vertex waves were noted in sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing, more prominent in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The underlying focal slowing may be correlated with this patient's imaging given the history of stroke.
