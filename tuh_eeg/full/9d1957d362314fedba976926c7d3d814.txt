REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old female with a history of seizures described as tonic/clonic while asleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  There were posterior slow waves seen at times and the patient becomes drowsy easily.
SEIZURES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  If concern for epilepsy continues repeat EEG capturing for deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in elucidating the diagnosis.
