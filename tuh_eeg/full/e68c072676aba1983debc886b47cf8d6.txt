LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of loss of consciousness for few seconds while talking on the phone approximately 2 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Include gabapentin, carvedilol, trazodone, omeprazole, simvastatin, and meclizine.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
