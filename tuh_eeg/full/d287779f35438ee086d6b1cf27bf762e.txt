History:	20YO FEMALE W/HX OF CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY. HAS BEEN SZ FREE FOR 12
YRS . HAD 2 BREAKTHROUGH  SZ IN NOVEMBER WHILE ASLEEP. SHAKING
WITNESSED BY FAMILY MEMBER, DURATION OF SZ'S UNKNOWN. PT CLAIMS
RETURN TO BASELINE WAS RIGHT AWAY.
Medications:	None Reported
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
, Normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
diagnosis of epilepsy.
