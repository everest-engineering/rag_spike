CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old gentleman with a long history of epilepsy, now with increasing tonic-clonic seizures in recent years. Vagal nerve stimulator.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Carbatrol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed but photic simulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz upper rhythm and some 9 Hz mu activity. In apparent, relaxed wakefulness, there are more extensive sections of the record with excess theta. Hyperventilation was not performed. Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits minimal driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG differs from previous EEGs in that there is a small amount of
excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Clinical factors may account for the excess theta in the
background although this patient's carbamazepine could also produce this pattern. In
an adult of this age, this finding may merit ongoing evaluation.
