CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed male with a history of epilepsy, also aneurysmal rupture with craniotomy, seizure free for the last year.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lexapro, Trazodone, Lotrel, HCTZ

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 hertz alpha rhythm
of 40 microvolts with a small amount of focal, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness
include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. In addition, the eye blink artifact and skull defect, rocking artifact, there is intermittent rhythmic 2-3 hertz slowing in the left frontotemporal region. That slowing is accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation. Photic stimulation elicits a supra harmonic driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively continuous rhythmic left frontotemporal focal 2-3 hertz slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function effecting gray and white matter. No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG. In comparison to a previous study from some years past, the overall record is
significantly improved.
