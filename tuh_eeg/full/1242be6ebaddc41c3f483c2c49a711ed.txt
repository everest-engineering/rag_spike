History:	54 year old man with a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic convulsion.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan
Sedation:	Lorazepam
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9-9.5 Hz low amplitude polymorphic alpha activity.  The AP gradient is weak and excessive diffuse theta and beta
activity is noted.  During drowsiness, myogenic artifact resolves and low amplitude vertex waves are
Subtle low amplitude intermittent independent brief bursts of rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA) are
noted over the bitemporal regions.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with poor effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation is not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), bilateral, independent, bilateral and subtle
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization and subtle independent bitemporal rhythmic delta activity. Diffuse slowing is
etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  TIRDA (temporal
intermittent rhythmic delta activity) suggests potential epileptogenic structural abnormality over the
bitemporal regions.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
