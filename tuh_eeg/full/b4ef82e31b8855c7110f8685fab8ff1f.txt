CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with new-onset seizures and confusion and depression.
MEDICATIONS: Benadryl, Lisinopril, Buspar, Celexa, Seroquel, Aricept.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low voltage but well defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. In this individual with memory problems, there is no background slowing and no specific hallmarks of another underlying neurologic disease.
