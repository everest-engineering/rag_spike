History: 57 Y/O WITH PMHX OF EPILEPSY SIP L CRANIOTOMY, ASTHMA, PSORIASIS.
PT ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL ON 12/4 WITH SZ AND FOUND TO HAVE ASPIRATION
PNA, METABOLIC ACIDOSIS.

Medications:

Sedation:

EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy

Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. awake, drowsy

Description:
In the most alert state, the PDR is 8.5-9 Hz which attenuates with eye opening. Symmetric frontocentral beta activity is present During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates with lack of eye blink artifact.

Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is left frontotemporal breach rhythm. Occasional left temporal sharp wave discharges are present, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at T3.

Hyperventilation is perform ad for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal slowing in the left temporal region. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not

Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves. Occasional, left temporal, no electrographic seizures
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal
Breach artifact. Left temporal

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of Continuous focal slowing In the left temporal region. This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. Epileptiform discharges in the left temporal
region. These findings are Indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Breach rhythm is consistent with history of craniotomy.
