CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed man with a past medical history of depression, lung cancer, and seizures presents with left arm shaking, found to have a tumor.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, Dilantin, Decadron, Ambien, Aspirin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  EEG was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm which at best reaches 9 Hz with a 20-60 microvolts amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Photic stimulation activated procedures did not produce any abnormal discharges including hyperventilation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There is continuous C4 P4 theta seen during the recording with an associated breach in that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central parietal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the right central parietal region, which is consistent with the known history of a tumor and resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
