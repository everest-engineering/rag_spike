CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old male with post traumatic epilepsy s post significant encephalomalacia.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan. Haldol, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: standard 10-20 Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient is quite agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: On the left, there is a 9.7-hertz rhythm with some alpha frequency on the left. The right hemisphere voltage more slow pattern. As the patient becomes drowsy. the alpha attenuation bilaterally. Other features of drowsiness include increase in beta. There is some shifting slowing. As the patient becomes drowsy in some sections of the record,  the left hemisphere becomes slower than the right.
HR: 102 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Prominent shifting asymmetries including drop out of the alpha on the right compared to the left and at other times more clear cut rhythmic slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features and breech rhythm on the left are anticipated findings following craniotomy. There are no sharp waves identified. Additional evaluation of the right hemisphere may be appropriate. In comparison to prior studies, the background is improved and there are no occipital sharp was.
