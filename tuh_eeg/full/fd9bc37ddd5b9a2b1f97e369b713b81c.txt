CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old right-handed woman with abrupt onset violent convulsions on June 3rd, past history of head trauma in childhood.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, Keppra, hydroxyzine, sertraline.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This captures
wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which is reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic slowing followed by an increase in beta. The patient is somewhat restless when drowsy or sleeping and deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous harmonic and supraharmonic driving. Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
