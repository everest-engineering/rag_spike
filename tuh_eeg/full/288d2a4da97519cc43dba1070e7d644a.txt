CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right-handed woman with gamma knife radiation for parasagittal meningioma. The patient had left-sided seizures yesterday and received Ativan and Dilantin. Also, lumbar compression fracture, breast cancer mastectomy.

MEDICATIONS: Decadron, Dilantin, Lasix, Cozaar, Ezetimibe, Zocor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There was no photic stimulation. Hyperventilation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow. The patient transitions in and out of some wakefulness to sleep. There are features of stage I sleep with vertex waves and POSTS. There is intermittent focal slowing in the left central temporal region some of which is somewhat sharply contoured.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing which varies and at times is more marked than at others.
2. Some shifting slowing a bit more prominent in the left mid and centrotemporal
regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and may be correlated with a structural functional abnormality. There were no significant epileptiform discharges observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be considered.
