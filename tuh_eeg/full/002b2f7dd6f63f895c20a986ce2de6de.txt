REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status, rule out seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension, TIA, right MCA stroke, and 2 days of decreased ambulation, now found to be staring, drooling, and not articulating when talking to the patient.  Loaded with Keppra.  EEG to rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, Protonix, hydralazine, isosorbide, lisinopril, Zocor, heparin, Zofran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 8.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at F7/T3 and independently at T4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness at 5 to 7 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing as well as mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region (left more than right), which is consistent with the known strokes.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse or generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
