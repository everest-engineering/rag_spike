CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old, right handed woman, 22-weeks pregnant with new
onset seizures. Past history of diabetes, DVT, anxiety, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Zofran, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is examined during
the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm
and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. There is a small amount
of background theta. There is also some shifting slowing in this bedside recording,
more so on the right. Features of drowsiness, including increase in beta with brief stage
2 sleep, followed by arousals. POSTS are observed in sleep.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small degree of background disorganization for age.
2. Occasional shifting and slowing, particularly in the posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a repeat tracing may be performed in the lab when the patient's
medical condition permits.
