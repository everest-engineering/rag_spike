History:	81 YEAR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. PMHX OF HTN, CVA, DM NOW WITH SPEECH
IMPAIRMENT AND MORE FREQUENT IN SEIZURE ACTIVITY ACCORDING TO
DAUGHTER, EYES ROLLING SHAKING BUT NO TONGUE BITING NO
INCONTINENCE. CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:	LISPRO,LISINOPRIL,LIPITOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches at best 6Hz  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region .  Intermittent
polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region .  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  very frequent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal
region (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.In addition there is  diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
