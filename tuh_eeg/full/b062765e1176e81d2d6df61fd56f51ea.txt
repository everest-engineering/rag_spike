History:	67 YO FEMALE ADMITTED MULTIPLE ACUTE INFARCTS WITH LEFT SIDE
WEAKNESS. R ARM CONTRACTURED, SPASTIC TO DAY R ARM TWITCHING.
R/O SZ
Medications:	Insulin, Methimazole, Protonix, Coumadin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 106  The patient had
continuous right arm jerking during the study with no EEG correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific. In addition, there is mild  diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The arm jerking had no EEG
correlate and as such it may represent a non-epileptic event or alternatively it may represent a
simple partial seizure which in up to 75% of cases it may not have an EEG correlate.
