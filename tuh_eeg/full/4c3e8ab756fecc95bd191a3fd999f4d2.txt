History:	23 year old man with ~ 4 days of progressively worse mental status.
Medications:	Ativan on 8/5/2015, Acyclovir, no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
With stimulation, the background consists of moderate-to-high amplitude diffuse slow delta activity
that is most pronounced over the temporal regions.  During periods of quiescence, the background
is a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity, with theta activity more pronounced posteriorly.
Additionally, diffuse low amplitude sleep-spindle-like waveforms are seen during periods of
No electrographic seizures are seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing.  This
finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
