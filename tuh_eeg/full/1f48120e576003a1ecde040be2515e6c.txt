CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old right-handed woman with childhood epilepsy, previously treated with Tegretol.  Seizures characterized by head and hand shaking.  Seizure free for the last 2 years with shaking, loss of consciousness, tongue biting, and postictal fatigue.  Positive family history of epilepsy.
INTRODUCTION:  A 26-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake stage 2 sleep record.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilos Ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Abundant stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  This is the 1st EEG in our lab for this individual.  If additional information is needed, a comparison with childhood studies may be valuable.
