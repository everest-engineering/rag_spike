CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old right handed male, traumatic brain injury, currently seizure free, but with significant problems with dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxcarbazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   The patient is poorly cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry and overall background disorganization.  There is a mixed frequency pattern with more arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant in comparison to the left.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm identified.  A breech rhythm is noted.  There is fast activity and also a right central sharp wave noted. As the patient becomes drowsy that right central and frontal central sharp wave is noted with particular involvement at C4.
In sleep the sharp wave transitions to a C4 P4 sharp wave.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Right central and parietal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no seizures recorded.  The background EEG is similar to previous studies.  Epileptiform activity in this case was a bit more prominent in
the right central and parietal region, but overall is not significantly different from his many previous EEGs.
