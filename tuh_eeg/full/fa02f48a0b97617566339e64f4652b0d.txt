CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old woman with a 7-year history of epilepsy.  Seizures increased 1 month ago.  Last seizure was 12 days ago.  The patient reports falling back, loss of consciousness, generalized tonic-clonic activity followed by confusion.  The patient had difficulty remembering to take her medications and past history of drug abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a background rich in beta activity.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  Rhythmic data is noted as the patient becomes drowsy.  She transitions in and out of drowsiness.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second normal EEG for this patient.  Previous normal EEG October 1, 2009.
In this individual with frequent seizures and 2 normal EEGs, additional EEG monitoring is warranted.
