Medications:	DILANTIN, VERSED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
The predominant background is characterized by a diffusely slow low voltage pattern with poor
variability and frequent bursts of slightly higher amplitude delta activity. No posterior dominant
rhythm is present.  Attenuation of faster frequencies is seen diffusely, with greater attenuation over
the left hemisphere.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in diffuse rhythmic theta
activity and muscle artifact.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 78.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, moderate diffuse
Attenuation, continuous, marked, bilateral (L>R) diffuse
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG in a sedated patient because of diffuse background slowing and
attenuation.  These findings are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific. The asymmetry with decreased faster frequencies over left
hemisphere is consistent with  cortical damage and the known infarct in that region.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
