CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old, right handed female, with epilepsy characterized by spells of dizziness, lightheaded, and feeling of shaking inside her body.  Currently suffering with pounding frontal headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol, Motrin, Tylenol with codeine and Depo-Provera.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with increased impedance in the T1-T2 electrode only.  Recording duration 22 minutes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, and increase in beta and rhythmic frontal central theta.
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate:  Slightly irregular at 72 BP.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep or comparison with this patient's previous studies may be of value.
