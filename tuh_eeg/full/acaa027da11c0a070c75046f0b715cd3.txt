CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year old right handed male with acute stroke, status post increasing expressing language difficulties following angiogram on the 19th.  MRI demonstrates possible insular infarct.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor, Darbepoetin, Zemplar, Aranesp

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was cooperative during the EEG.  There was a fair amount of muscle artifact observed.  There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 7-8 Hz alpha rhythm identified.  There is intermittent focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly the left temporal region with occasional sharply contoured slowing maximum at T1-T3 with a relatively broad field of spread.  As the recording continues, the awake record is relatively well organized with a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, mild background slowing.
2. Superimposed, intermittent focal slowing from the left temporal region which is sometimes sharply contoured on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The focal slowing identified is congruent with the infarct.  If the patient's symptoms do not improve, follow up EEG may be of value.
