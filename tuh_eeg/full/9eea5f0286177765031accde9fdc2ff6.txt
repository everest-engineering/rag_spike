History: 57 year old woman with seizures in sleep.
Medications: Keppra and Zonegran
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 system; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV. 9Hz alpha rhythm. Which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV. 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. At times in wakefulness there are short burst of less than 2 seconds of Frontal intermittent delta activity (FIRDA). During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta
activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
Intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from1Â·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Hr 42
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing. This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse dysfunction. which is etiologically nonspecific.
