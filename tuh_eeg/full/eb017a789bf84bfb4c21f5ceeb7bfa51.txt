MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor.
HISTORY:  A 67-year-old woman with recent cerebellar decompression for CNS metastasis, evaluate for seizures.
I NTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred. Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 7 to 8 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 to 50 microvolts.  In wakefulness, there are intermittent bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity. They are somewhat higher amplitude on the right, but somewhat prolonged in duration on the left.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. Heart rate irregular 72 to 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent background slowing.
Shifting arrhythmic delta activity noted from either hemisphere.
Breach rhythm in the right occipital region, more so than the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted. The intermittent background slowing is a nonspecific finding which could be associated with this patient's underlying medical condition.  No epileptiform features were seen and there were no strongly lateralizing features.
