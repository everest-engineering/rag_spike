History:	49 year old woman who had two nocturnal episodes in the late 2014 that were
concerning for seizures.
EEG from 12/2014 reported presence of subtle 3-5 Hz generalized spike and wave
discharges.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  A brief epoch of slow wave sleep is observed.  Bursts of
diffuse high amplitude 3-5 Hz delta activity are captured during drowsiness and sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing and bursts of diffuse 3-5 Hz high amplitude delta activity.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1-hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Bursts of high amplitude diffuse delta
activity are not pathologic.
