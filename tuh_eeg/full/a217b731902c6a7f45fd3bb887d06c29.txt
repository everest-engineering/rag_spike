CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left carotid stenosis, multiple cerebral aneurysms.

MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Diclofenac, lipitor

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a baseline study for left carotid endarterectomy.  There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation possible.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by brief attenuation of the alpha rhythm and slow rolling eye movements.

Heart rate:  Low voltage EKG  72 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This study will be used for the baseline monitoring session.
