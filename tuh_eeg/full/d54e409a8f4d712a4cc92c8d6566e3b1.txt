CLINICAL HISTORY: A 19-year-old woman, 26 weeks pregnant, with staring spells, episodes of poor responsiveness with shaking.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record in a very sleepy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of this EEG includes abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. In maximal wakefulness the background EEG includes a 9.5-Hz alpha rhythm with head rocking artifact. The patient quickly drifts back to stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The hypersomnolence is the most remarkable feature about this record. These findings can be seen in the context of sleep deprivation or the use of medications. Additional evaluation for other causes of hypersomnolence may be considered. This record is a wonderful example of all the typical waveforms of stage 2 sleep.
