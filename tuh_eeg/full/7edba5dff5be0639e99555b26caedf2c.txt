History:	21 YEAR OLD MALE WITH A HISTORY OF SEIZURES. LAST SEIZURE AS 12/20/2013.
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Occasional brief (0.5-2 seconds) bursts of sharply contoured delta activity are noted during hyperventilation and drowsiness. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.

No focal slowing is present. No clear epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces bursts of diffuse, symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal delta activity. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.

Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is a likely NORMAL 25-minute EEG, awake and drowsy. Brief bursts of diffuse delta activity observed during hyperventilation and drowsiness are of uncertain clinical significance and may represent sleep architecture. A repeat prolonged EEG with sleep may be of benefit.
