History:	61 yo male p/w altered mental status. ? sz. pt had right eye deviation.
Medications:	Propofol
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage (almost completely attenuated) delta and theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, severe diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
