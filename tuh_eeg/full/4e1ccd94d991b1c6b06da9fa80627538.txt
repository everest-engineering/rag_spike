History:	41 year old man with a history of a prior stroke and seizures.
Medications:	Keppra Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes , awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Occasional, sometimes subtle, polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal region during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing , polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal, anterior, sometimes subtle
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 23 minute EEG due to occasional mild left anterior temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
