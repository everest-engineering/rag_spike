History:	56 YEARS AGO HAD A FX SKULL RIGHT FRONTAL AFTER FALLING AND
HITTING HER HEAD. PT NOW SEEING (2 YEARS)  FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHTS
WITH PAIN IN HER HEAD - SOMETIMES SHE NEEDS TO SCREAM TO GET IT
TO GO AWAY. PT HAD AN EPISODE OF SYNCOPE 2 WEEKS AGO.
Medications:	Patient could not recall
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 48
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
