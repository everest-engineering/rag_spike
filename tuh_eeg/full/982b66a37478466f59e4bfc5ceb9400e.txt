REASON FOR STUDY:  Falls.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old man with mental retardation, deafness, and ataxia, now with falls with a history of a mom being a drug abuser during pregnancy with crack use.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY:  Throughout the entire recording, there is movement and muscle artifact seen continuously.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This limited EEG reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that at best appears to reaches 7 Hz.  This seems to be reactive to eye opening.  No normal beta can be seen due to the muscle artifact.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded only in wakefulness.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta during wakefulness.

HEART RATE:  90.

IMPRESSION:  Limited abnormal EEG due to excessive theta in wakefulness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
