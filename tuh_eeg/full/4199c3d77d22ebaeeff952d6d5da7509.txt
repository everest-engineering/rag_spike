History:	39 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES. AND SEVERE MENTAL RETARDATION.
LAST SZ 4/29/14. PMHS: MR, SZS, ASTHMA  HARD TO GET INFO FROM MOM
HAS SZS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, SEROQUEL, HALOPERIDOL, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
There is diffuse excess 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 100.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, slow PDR
, Excess theta
, Diffuse beta
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of  diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Note the patient is tachycardic.
