INTRODUCTION:
An EEG is performed using standard the 10-20 electrode placement system with an EKG electrode. Awake and stage I sleep is recorded. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were used.
MEDICATIONS:
Vimpat and Tegretol.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None.
HISTORY:
A 37-year-old female who presents for followup EEG with past medical history significant for generalized epilepsy. Last seizure was reported in February 2011, with fall and loss of consciousness with urinary incontinence and postictal confusion lasting for an hour.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
Posterior dominant alpha rhythm is seen at 9 to 10Hz frequency and 20 microvolt amplitude which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Frontocentral beta rhythm is also seen. Stage I sleep is seen and is normal. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed, which are also normal.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized spike and wave at 4 to 4.5 Hz and 70 to 100 microvolts amplitude is seen, which is located maximum anteriorly. This generalized pattern is asymmetric with slight predominance in the left hemisphere. No seizures are seen.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The EEG findings can be seen in generalized epilepsy; however, a sight asymmetric pattern raises the possibility of a focal epilepsy with secondary bilateral synchrony.
