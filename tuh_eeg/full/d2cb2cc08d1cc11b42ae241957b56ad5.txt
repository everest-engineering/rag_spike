CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old male status post an altercation with facial and cranial
trauma; the patient was intoxicated. Cerebral contusions, anxiety, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Klonopin, Celexa, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
The patient is awake and agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed
frequency pattern rich in beta frequency activity. There is also prominent delta activity
noted. Shifting slowing is noted, and the activity is somewhat sharply contoured at T6
and C4. It is also somewhat sharply contoured in an overall quite sharp background at
02. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation does
not activate the record.
HR: 102 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Sharply contoured, markedly disorganized background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this sharply contoured background, there is sharply
contoured slowing and a followup study to determine if there is potentially epileptiform
activity is suggested.
