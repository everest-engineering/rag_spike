History:	55 year old woman with a history of right hemispheric insult at a young age and
subsequent seizures.  Seizures are nocturnal and are characterized by left arm
stiffening with preservation of consciousness.

OF NOTE, it was discovered on 10/13/2015 that 4 EEG leads were misplugged at
the time of this recording.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
The background consists of 8 Hz moderate amplitude posterior dominant rhythm that attenuates
with eye opening.  There is expected AP gradient.  Patient remains awake throughout the
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited, 4 EEG leads were misplugged
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because several EEG leads were misplugged and this was
not discovered until the day after this recording was completed. Otherwise, this is an unremarkable
28 minute awake only EEG.  No electrographic seizures are present.
