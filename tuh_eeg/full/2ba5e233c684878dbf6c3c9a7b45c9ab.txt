REASON FOR STUDY:  Altered mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 64-year-old man found with an altered mental status, nonverbal, not following commands, a left facial droop and right-sided weakness, with a history of chronic kidney disease on dialysis, HIV, COPD and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, aspirin, Zosyn, abacavir, raltegravir, Pravastatin, Tylenol, Dextrose, cefepime, heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included  photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 7 Hz which appears somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient appears to have some stage changes, but no typical sleep architecture.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 and independently at F8/T4 (slightly more on the right than the left) at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  114 and appears irregularly.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing (right more than left) in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (right more than left) in addition to generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
