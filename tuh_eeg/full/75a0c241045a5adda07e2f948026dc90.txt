History: 41 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF HAND TREMORS FOR YRS. LEFT HAND> RIGHT
Medications: none
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Awake & asleep
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5.15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. Maximal bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing Is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) Induces symmetric photic driving. HR Is 70 bpm.

Summary of Findings:
Normal EEG

Interpretation:
This Is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
