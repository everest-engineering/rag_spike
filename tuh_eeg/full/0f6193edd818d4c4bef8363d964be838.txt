CLINICAL HISTORY: 88 year old woman with advanced dementia and status epilepticus.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Benzodiazepines,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is rigid and contractured. She is nonverbal and has difficulty communicating.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Underneath a pattern of diffuse beta and muscle artifact, there seems to be some frontal delta, right more so than left and in wakefulness what seems to be a vertex sharp wave. In this very challenging EEG, there is likely an underlying epileptiform focus in the right hemisphere best visualized at P4-PZ.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to: EEG due to:
1. Muscle artifact, but Absence of normal waveforms one would expect to see in wakefulness.
2. What seems to be an epileptiform focus in the right hemisphere likely at the central parietal regions, but in some locations seems to be more midline and perhaps potentially frontal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function as may be seen in advanced dementia. A localization related mechanism for epilepsy is an appropriate conclusion.
