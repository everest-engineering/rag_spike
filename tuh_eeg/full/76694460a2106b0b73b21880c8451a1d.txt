LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old woman status post recent right craniotomy for a brain tumor who had a seizure on 12/13/2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are Decadron, Protonix and Keppra.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with faster waveforms over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is better preserved over the left hemisphere.  No sleep is captured.  Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity are present over the right hemisphere, predominantly over the right frontotemporal central region.  Additional faster frequencies are captured over the right frontocentral region.  No clear epileptiform discharges were observed.
FINDINGS:
Focal right hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the right frontotemporal central region.
Breach over the right frontocentral region.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only, nearly 26 minute EEG, due to moderate focal right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right frontotemporal central region.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of a right hemispheric brain tumor and craniotomy.  Breach is seen as a result of a skull defect over that region.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persistent, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
