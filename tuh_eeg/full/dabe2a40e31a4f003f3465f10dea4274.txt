CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old female with past medical history of stroke, hypertension, seizures, lupus, and type 4 RTA, presents with episode of bradycardia, hemiplegia on the left side.
MEDICATIONS:  Diltiazem, Diphenhydramine, Levetiracetam, Labetalol, Atorvastatin, Furosemide, Omeprazole, Clonidine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Possible seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact and single electrode artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at best 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some normal amount of frontocentral beta.
Activating procedures that were performed included photic stimulation which revealed no abnormal discharges and hyperventilation which accentuated some focal slowing as described below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen almost continuously over the right hemisphere, maximum at F8/T4 and intermittently seen at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous right anterior temporal slowing.
Independent occasional left anterior temporal slowing.  The slowing was accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
