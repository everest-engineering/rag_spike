INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified. It is 45 microvolts. Drowsiness is characterized by an increasing
theta and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
