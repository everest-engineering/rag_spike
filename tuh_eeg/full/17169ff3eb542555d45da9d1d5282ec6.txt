HEAD.
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm that reached at best 6Hz was present.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse delta/theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Some faster frequencies were seen at times over the central and frontal
regions.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, some not
well formed symmetric sleep spindles appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 60  Technical difficulties:
There was a frequent left occipital artifact and movement artifact. Limited wakefulness is captured.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the left central region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.In addition
there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
