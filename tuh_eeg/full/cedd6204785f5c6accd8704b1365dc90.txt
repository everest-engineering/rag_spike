CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old woman with change in mental status, inability to walk or to talk.  She has a history of right breast cancer, glaucoma, diabetes, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Midazolam, Lorazepam, Lisinopril, Lovenox, Insulin, Ceftriaxone, Zocor
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record, at best, reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen during limited wakefulness.  The majority of the record is in drowsiness or sleep.  There appears to be somewhat normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at times T3/T5 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  At times very sharply contoured in that region.
Generalized slowing in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left mid temporal and posterior temporal focal slowing.
Mild to moderate generalized slowing in limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid to posterior temporal region, in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
