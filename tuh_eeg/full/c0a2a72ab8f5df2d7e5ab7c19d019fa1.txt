History:	50 year old woman with a history of seizures, now with increase in seizure
Medications:	ACETAMINOPHEN,ALBUTEROL NICOTINE NAPROXEN,TRILEPTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Very brief waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is present over the left anterior temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with poor cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
several flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal, anterior
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and mostly asleep 23-minute EEG due to occasional mild left
anterior temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
