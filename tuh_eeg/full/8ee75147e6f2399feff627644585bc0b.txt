History:		17 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS ON 8/14/2015 WITH H/O S/P FALL FROM 2ND FLOOR WINDOW. PT COMBATIVE AT SCENE. PT MAY HAVE HAD SZ PRIOR TO FALL DUE TO SMOKING K-2. NOTE WITH SZ IN ED, THEN SZ ON 8/16.
Medications:	KEPPRA Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity  is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions independently (left more than right) during wakefulness,  increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation , and produces no effect. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R} temporal, anterior Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing bilateral anterior temporal regions independently (left more than right). This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is etiologically nonspecific.
