CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old woman with liver disease, alcoholism, right occipital subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizures, twitching of the left side of the mouth and incontinence.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. The posterior dominant rhythm is 6.5 Hz. Arrhythmic delta activity is identified posterior regions shifting and can be seen from either posterior region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Vertex waves and K complexes are seen in sleep. Sleep is not sustained and the patient arouses spontaneously out of sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background.
2. Posteriorly predominant arrhythmic delta activity independent on the left or the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. Contributing factors may include this patient's metabolic problems and her past subdural hematoma.
