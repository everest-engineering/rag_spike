History:	21 year old woman with a history seizures, now presents with increase in seizure
frequency.
Medications:	TOPAMAX, KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is seen.  Intermittent symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Bursts of diffuse moderate
amplitude theta activity are captured.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  A single event is captured.  It lasts ~ 3-4 minutes (its onset
and offset is not clear).  It is characterized by unresponsiveness, not following commands, bilateral
leg extension.  There is no change in background during the event.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No stage 2 sleep
Event, one, no ictal correlate
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute awake-only EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  A single ~3-4
minute event of unresponsiveness and leg extension has no abnormal EEG correlate.
