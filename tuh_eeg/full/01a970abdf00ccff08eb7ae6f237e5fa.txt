History:	29 Y/O MALE CAME TO ED FOR H/A THIS AM WAS RESPONSIVE AND WAS
AWARE OF A BRAIN MASS IN HIS HEAD. AND THEN BECAME UNRESPONSIVE.
57 CM HEAD..... LTM
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 18 hours from 06/30/2015 to 7/01/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
none
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Hr was 78
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
