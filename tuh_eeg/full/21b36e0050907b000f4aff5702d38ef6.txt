CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old woman with past history of epilepsy, now complaining of headaches which worsened in the evening and are described as worse than a migraine.
MEDICATIONS:  No seizure medications reported.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a 9 Hz alpha rhythm was noted.  Mu activity is noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and increase in beta, followed by vertex waves.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The EEG recorded today is within normal limits for age.
