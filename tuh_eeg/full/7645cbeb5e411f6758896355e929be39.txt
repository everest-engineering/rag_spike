CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 82-year-old male with a syncopal spell, found to have a hypodensity in the left frontal regions and right parietotemporal regions as well as diffuse atrophy.
MEDICATIONS:  Flomax, Plavix, others, Aricept.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Unfortunately, there was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.  This was primarily an awake EEG in a somewhat restless individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  In wakefulness, there is occasional, intermittent slowing.  There are generous sections of the record when the EEG is awake without background slowing.  Rare FIRDA was observed.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for intermittent slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  On the whole, this is a very well organized EEG for an older adult with significant dementia.  Despite the CT scan changes, there is little in the way of focal slowing.
