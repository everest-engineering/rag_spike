CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old female, status post code on January 11, 2012 with the development of myoclonus, treated with Ativan, versed, and Depakote.  Renal failure, status post dialysis on Friday.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Ativan, Depakote
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is critically ill.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of this 24-hour period includes some frontally predominant generalized periodic complexes and some triphasic waves.  There is little in the way of frequency evolution of these, although on the afternoon of January 13, 2012, prior to resumption of the EEG monitoring, the patient was reported to have a clinical seizure with eye deviation and focal facial twitching.
Over the course of this long term monitoring session, there is a significant reduction in the periodic activity or epileptiform appearing activity.
By the close of the record, a diffusely slow mixed theta pattern is noted.  This is a transition from a higher amplitude theta pattern with some frontal sharp waves.  There is some sections, including at 2:00 a.m., with frontal delta, but no eye movements are noted.
HR:    126 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG demonstrates a dramatic improvement, most remarkable after 10:00 a.m. on January 14, 2012 with significant reduction of generalized periodic activity or some frontal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's post anoxic pattern is improving.  In addition, her epileptiform activity demonstrated marked reduction of her time.
