History:	78 YO FEMALE FOUND UNRESPONSIVE AND WITH INTERMITTANT SHAKING.
R/O SZ. PT WAS HYPOTHERMIC
FOLLOW UP STAT PROLONG EEG 7/13/2014 FOR AMS, RIGHT ARM AND
FACIAL TWITCH VS SUBCLINICAL SZ.

PMHX: LEFT SIDED PARESIS
ADMITTED 10/12/14 FOR SZ.
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by right
hemisphere low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies. Over the left hemisphere, there is continuous attenuation of faster
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid-temporal region.  Periodic
lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the right hemisphere, including T4 and occasionally F4 and F8 region at a rate of 0.5-1.0 Hz.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 84
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, right temporal
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs) and focal slowing in the right temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a highly
potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion.  No electrographic seizures are present.
There is also attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere, which may be due to an
overlying fluid collection or alternatively it may indicate a cortical lesion over that region.  Lastly,
there is  diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
