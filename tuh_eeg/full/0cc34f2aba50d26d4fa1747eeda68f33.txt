CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Step photic simulation was performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of brain damage, expressive and receptive aphasia, diffuse motor dysfunction.  All of these symptoms are secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 1990.  Several days ago, the patient had an episode of loss of consciousness.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Tegretol, Demerol, Vistaril valium, albuterol, baclofen pump and others.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9-10 Hz alpha activity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is weak and unstable.  The majority of the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic alpha, theta and delta activity.  During drowsiness and sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, fragmented sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Step photic stimulation results in no additional abnormalities.  A regular heart rate is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
Stage II sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG, due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing.  This findings indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
