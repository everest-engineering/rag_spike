Clinical History: A 45-year-old woman with a history of pancreas and kidney transplant on chronic immunotherapy, suffering metastatic cancer, bilateral occipital strokes, and epilepsy. The patient was admitted on the 22nd after a cardiac arrest in the field. EEG monitoring initiated for hypothermic protocol.

Medications: Phenytoin, gabapentin. Prograf, and low-dose fentanyl.

Introduction: Digital video EEG was Initiated in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. The patients body temperature was 33.9 When the initial E.EEG began and the patient was in the rewarming phase of the hypothermia protocol

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with an essentially suppressed pattern with brief bursts lasting 1-1.5seconds In duration with higher amplitude myoclonic theta some of Which is sharply contoured. Periods of suppression may be as long as 20 seconds. Tactile stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.

HEART RATE 72 BPM.

IMPRESSION: This 20 minute, bedside ICU record was remarkable for:
1. A burst suppression pattern
2. Absence of reactivity or variability.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG, in conjunction with the clinical exam carries a worrisome prognostic features. Of note, this patient had just been rewarmed and additional monitoring was initiated.
