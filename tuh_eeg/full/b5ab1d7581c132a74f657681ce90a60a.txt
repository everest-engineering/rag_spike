CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old male with recurrent dizziness and vertigo admitted with Dilantin toxicity and long history of posttraumatic epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, Percocet, Ativan, Lisinopril, Zocor, Lovenox, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of background disorganization. Occasional focal slowing is noted in the right hemisphere. This is accentuated by hyperventilation which produces more rhythmic slowing from the right hemisphere and right anterior temporal sharp waves. In the transition to sleep, additional arrhythmic delta is noted in the right mid to anterior temporal region with dropout of faster frequencies. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep but does elicit a subtle driving response.
HR: 60 bpm with occasional PVC's.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing.
2. Right temporal sharp waves and hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
