CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old woman with schizophrenia and syncope, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, insulin, Lipitor, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1- hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Early in drowsiness, there is an increase in theta.  There is prominent muscle and chew artifact noted in the background, more so on the left than the right.  As the patient transitions into drowsiness, there are occasional bursts of somewhat irregular mixed theta delta in the right or left temporal region.  Other features of drowsiness include bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.  Snoring and snore arousals were noted.  In more sustained drowsiness, there is a bit more focal slowing noted in the left hemisphere.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm, abnormal QRS complexes.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to shifting temporal slowing, left greater than right noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The findings described above may be correlated with imaging.  The EKG may be correlated with this patient's previous study. (EKG example forward to ptâ€™s cardiologist
