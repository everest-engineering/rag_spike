Medications:	VIMPAT, KEPPRA, SEROQUEL, LIPITOR, FOLIC ACID, THIAMINE, LOVENOX

EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an  alpha rhythm that at best reaches 7Hz  Background
activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity.  Some state changes can be seen, but
no normal sleep is noted.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region with decreased
amplitude of all frequencies.  Frequent rhythmic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing and decreased
amplitude in the right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction
in this region, likely structural in origin involving cortex. In addition there is  intermittent focal
slowing in the left midtemporal region and diffuse slowing .  These findings are indicative of focal
and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, and are etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic
