CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old male found agitated with cerebellar atrophy and strokes as well as hypodensities.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a continuous pattern. There is a mixed frequency pattern rich in beta. There are shifting asymmetries with a bit of delta in the left posterior quadrant and a suggestion of very subtle underlying sharp wave in the left central and parietal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle artifact but the overall background remains slow.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed posteriorly predominant delta particularly in the left posterior quadrant
3. Questionable sharp waves in the left central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow up study when the patient is out of the ICU may be helpful.
