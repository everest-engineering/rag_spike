CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed male status post resection of left frontal meningioma who presents with three days of bilateral lower extremity weakness and loss of sensation.
MEDICATIONS:  Decadron, Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in the wakefulness stage I sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F3/Fz at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV.  There is also an associated breach in this region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left frontal focal slow waves and breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region, which is consistent with an known meningioma resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
