CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed woman with blackout spells for 10 years, migraine, anxiety, depression.
MEDICATIONS: Prozac, Folate, Cyclobenzaprine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 hertz alpha rhythm, 10 hertz, central mu activity is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this. There is a somewhat unusual right frontal eye blink artifact. It is clearly artifactual and it is picked up in the EKG lead and the eye movement, but this resembles spike and wave activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at faster frequencies. Brief stage II sleep was characterized by vertex waves, POSTS and K complexes.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were noted. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. The eye artifact is a normal finding.
