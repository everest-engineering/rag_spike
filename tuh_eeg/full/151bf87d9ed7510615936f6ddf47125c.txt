CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old woman with severe chronic static encephalopathy, fetal alcohol syndrome, epilepsy, von Willebrand's disease, currently doing well, but history of refractory, recurrent seizures.
MEDICINES:  Lamictal, Dilantin, Keppra, and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1 hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was awake, briefly drowsy had great difficulty tolerating the study.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the continuous muscle and movement artifact, the background EEG demonstrates the dynamic pattern.  There are some sections of the record, but a lower voltage, featureless pattern.  At other times, there is rhythmic 4-5 hertz, frontal theta.  A 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was noted in the rare sections of the record.
The patient has automatisms, clapping, tapping and vocalizing.  These do not have an ictal signature and are not clearly associated with a rhythmic theta pattern.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An unusual pattern, which includes awake pattern with intermittent rhythmic theta.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal epileptiform features were noted in this record.  This longer record did identify a more organized, awake pattern.  This was compared to a previous EEG from 2 years ago which demonstrated high amplitude, paroxysmal theta delta.  This is a second EEG in our lab without epileptiform features.  Additional annual evaluation may be helpful to characterize this patient's EEG as she transitions into adulthood.
