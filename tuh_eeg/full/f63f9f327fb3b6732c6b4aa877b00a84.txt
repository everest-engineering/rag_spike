CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old woman with Xanax dependence, the patient has a history of Xanax withdrawal seizures after missing medicines for 2 years, one in recent days, another 7 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Abilify, Celexa, Percocet, Xanax, and albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Technically satisfactory record with most impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and abundant beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with beta spindles in stage 2 sleep and POSTS.
Hyperventilation was performed with poor effort and did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited abundant driving.  Lambda waves were noted at the end of the record.
Heart rate 78 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep with generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.
