History:	52 year male with PMH of seizures secondary to head trauma.  Patient now presents
with reported breakthrough seizures secondary to non-compliance with medications.
Medications:	Dilantin, Flexeril, Advil
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low voltage 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  There is
continuous eye blinking/ eye flutter artifact.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up to 120
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, eye movement, continuous, eye blinking artifact
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Continuous eye blinking/ eye flutter artifact obscures bifrontal leads and
subtle anterior slowing could have been missed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up to
