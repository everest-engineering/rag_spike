AGE: 69 y.o.
SEX: male
START DATE OF STUDY: 12/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient EEG TYPE: routine
EEG #: 15-1761
HISTORY :
69 y.o. male with a history of TBI, SAH referred for EEG for recurrent orthostatic hypotension, fall earlier this year with right parietal scalp hematoma .
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions :
FLUDROCORTISONE ACETATE (FLORINEF ORAL), Take	by mouth.
Duloxetine {CYMBALTA) 30 mg capsule , Take 30 mg by mouth daily . Olanzapine {ZYPREXA) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth nightly. midodrine (PROAMATINE) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
divalproex {DEPAKOTE) 500 mg EC tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet , Take 500 mg by mouth nightly .
divalproex {DEPAKOTE) 250 mg EC tablet, Take 250 mg by mouth nightly .
oxycodone-acetaminophen (ENDOCET) 10-325 mg per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for Pain.
SEDATION : None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation . Right occipital head rocking artifact was noted
BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous, symmetric, well-organized. There is a well-defined anterior to posterior gradient of frontocentral beta and excess background theta
Posterior dominant rhythm was of 7-8 Hz is present The background is reactive, and variable.
Sleep: Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in background slowing with paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.	Of note, shifting arrhythmic delta, more prominent in the right posterior quadrant is noted in drowsiness.	Brief vertex waves were noted in stage I sleep
PAROXSYMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
Photic Stimulation :
Scant driving was identified, more remarkable in the right posterior quadrant
EVENTS: None
HR:	72 beats per minute
IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Abnormal EEG due to
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm
In the context of head rocking artifact, underlying focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant
No epileptiform features were noted, but stage II sleep was not achieved.
This EEG supports a mild, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. The focal features may be correlated with imaging
