CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 wear old left handed woman with epilepsy, seizure free for 5-6 years. Primary generalized epilepsy with positive family history of epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Phenytek, Phenobarbital.

INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the-background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 9 Hz. Early in drowsiness, there is prominent rhythmic slowing. There is a hypersynchronous drowsy pattern, which attenuates with stimulation. With stimulation the alpha rhythm reaches 10 Hz.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.

Following photic stimulation there is a high amplitude 2 second burst of paroxysmal spike and wave activity which is generalized in nature, high amplitude with a frontal polyspike component. This is approximately 3.5 Hz discharge. No impairment of awareness is noted with the bursts.

HR: 60 bpm

Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and light sleep due to:
1. Bursts of paroxysmal frontally predominantly spike and wave activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are relatively characteristic of this epilepsy syndrome. No seizures were recorded.
