History:	91 YR MALE FOR EVALUATION OF SEIZURES.  PER NURSING HOME 3 LAST 6
MONTHS. STARING EVENTS. PER PT DOES NOT HAVE SEIZURE
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN,  FENTANYL PATCH.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves
occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 72 irregular and frequent PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
