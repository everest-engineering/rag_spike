CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 68-year-old female with history of complex partial seizures, currently seizure-free since 2007.  Follow-up:  Denies any recent activity.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with single lead EKG.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens up with rhythm that reaches 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal, central, beta.  The patient is recorded only in wakefulness.  Procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  No abnormal discharges.

Heart rate:  66 and regular.

Abnormal discharges:  None.

Seizures:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.

This is a normal awake EEG with no seizures or epileptiform discharges seen.  Please note, the patient was only awake and if epilepsy remains a concern, deeper state capturing the first stages of sleep may be helpful in elucidating the diagnosis.

Please also note that the patient has had multiple EEGs in the past, none of which have had any epileptiform abnormalities that I was able to review in the charts at this hospital.
