CLINICAL HISTORY: 88 year old right handed woman with a syncopal spell, recurrent syncope in 2008 and 2009.
MEDICATIONS: Naprosyn, Norvasc, Lovenox, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age. There is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. In drowsiness there is a small amount of temporal theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. In later sections as the patient becomes drowsy, there is very subtle occasional slowing in the left central region.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rare slowing in the left central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. There were no epileptiform features observed.
