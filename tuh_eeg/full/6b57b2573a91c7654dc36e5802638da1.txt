History: 40 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS X2. PT ALSO HAS MIGRAINES. PMHX: HTN. ATROPHY LEFT KIDNEY.
Medications: AMBIEN, MECLIZINE, BENADRYL
Sedation:
EEG Type: None
Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10.20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T11T2 electrodes. Awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40 uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric S.15uV,16-25Hz activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness. the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1Â·21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR Is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Normal
Interpretation:
This Is a NORMAL EEG. Awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
