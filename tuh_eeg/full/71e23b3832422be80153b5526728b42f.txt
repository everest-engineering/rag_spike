History:	50 YO FEMALE A FEW WEEKS AGO BEGAN HAVING ABNORMAL MOUTH
MOVEMENTS, WHERE SHE CONT. TO BITE HER TONGUE. WHICH COME AND
GO, TYPICALLY OCCURRING AT NIGHT. NO HX OF SZ. "BROTHER TAKES SZ
MEDS."
Medications:	LITHIUM, WELLBUTRIN, PROZAC, TRAZODONE, COGENTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 72  Patient exhibited frequent mouth
movement through out the record.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
