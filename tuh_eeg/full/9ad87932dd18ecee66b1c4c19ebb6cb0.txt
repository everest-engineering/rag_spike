MEDICATIONS:  Acyclovir, Cipro, Ipratropium, Pulmicort.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG reveals diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz.  There is some frontocentral beta seen intermittently.  Activating procedures were not performed. The patient is recorded in wakefulness and there are some state changes consistent with sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz seen almost continuously throughout the recording with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None
CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
