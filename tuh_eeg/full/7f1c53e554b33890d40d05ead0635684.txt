REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
HISTORY:  A 43-year-old man with history of seizures for 2 years, last one occurred on June 26, 2013 while sleeping, tongue-biting and stiffness of the body for 5 minutes.  He missed a couple of dosages of his prior meds.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is a continuous A1 artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen frequently to almost continuously at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left much more than right focal slowing in the anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral (left much more than right) focal cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
