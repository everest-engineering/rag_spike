History:	58 year old woman with a history of seizures without loss of consciousness.
Medications:	Lamictal, Flexeril and others
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
Occasional shifting polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the bitemporal regions (R>L)
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Occasional 50-75uV, 100 msec positive
sharp transients occur bilaterally over the occipital regions of the head during saccadic eye
Summary of Findings:
Lambda waves, occasional
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, bilateral (R>L) temporal, shifting mild focal bitemporal
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG because of mild occasional shifting focal
slowing in the bitemporal region, right>left.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges were
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
