CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old woman with 2 seizures in December 2009 and
February 10, 2010. The patient is unable to recall any features of the seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This an awake through stage 2 sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
10.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage
frontal central beta activity. The patient is quite drowsy, dropping into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.

HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed, however,
a normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
