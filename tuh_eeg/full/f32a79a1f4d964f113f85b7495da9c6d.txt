AGE: 64 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/07/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG # :  15-1773
HISTORY:
64 y.o. male with a history of seizures and alcohol abuse, referred for routine EEG for a seizure in the setting of a dilantin level of 35.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7.5-8 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
Mild generalized slowing is present.
There is continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 86 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy	routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing
Continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of a left hemispheric lesion, likely structural in etiology, superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
