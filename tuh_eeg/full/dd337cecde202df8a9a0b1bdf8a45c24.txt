History:	78 year old woman status post SAH.
Medications:	none listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower
waveforms and lower voltages over the left.  The background over the right consists of mixture of
polymorphic occasional theta and prominent delta activity.  The background over the left, consists
of attenuated slow polymorphic delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, left hemispheric
Attenuation, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing and continuous
severe focal left hemispheric slowing and attenuation. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing
and attenuation over the left indicates focal structural lesion in this region as well as a possible
fluid collection between brain and a skull (such as subdural hematoma).  No electrographic seizures
