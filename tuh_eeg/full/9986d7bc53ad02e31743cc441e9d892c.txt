CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 47-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy, frequent eye blinking and twitching.  History of head trauma on the right side.  Episodes of loss of consciousness, bilateral trembling, twitching, jerking, feeling of confusion and aphasia.  Strange feelings occur every month.  Last event September 8.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized.  There is an alpha rhythm of 7-8 Hz.  On occasion, the alpha rhythm is disrupted on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm, increase in beta and post.
Hyperventilation produces increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Some shifting asymmetries with at times disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG for this individual.  The 2007 EEG was normal, but the 2010 EEG demonstrated background slowing. None of the EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  Clinical correlation with exam, imaging and clinical symptomatology is suggested.
