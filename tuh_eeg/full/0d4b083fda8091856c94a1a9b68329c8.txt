CLINICAL HISTORY:   72 year old right handed woman with history of chest pain, noted to have decreased responsiveness and soon returned to baseline.  EEG to rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Isosorbide, Advair, Plavix, Zocor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Question seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, only photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7, T3, and independently at F8, T4, at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent anterior bitemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  In addition, there is some mild generalized slowing which maybe normal for age.  No seizures were seen.
