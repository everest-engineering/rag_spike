History:	76 year old man with recent right subdural hematoma, now with 5 minute episode
of decreased responsiveness.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 6-7 Hz polymorphic low amplitude theta activity.  The AP
gradient is weak.  Excess diffuse low amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves
and sleep spindles are captured.
Intermittent independent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present posteriorly.  No clear
epileptiform discharges are present.  An episode of decreased responsiveness lasting ~20-30
seconds is captured.  Electrographically it corresponds with sleep.  Once patient's name is loudly
called, he wakes up, opens his eyes and starts answering the questions.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A regular heart rate is noted on a
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral posterior, independent
Other, episode of decreased responsiveness corresponds electrographically with sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 34 minute EEG because of mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and intermittent independent focal moderate posterior slowing.  Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Posterior slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Patient
became briefly non-responsive during the study because he fell asleep.
