MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred. This is an awake and drowsy 24 minute record. This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. In drowsiness, rhythmic temporal theta with 7 Hz activity is identified in the left to right temporal region. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta
Heart rate: 72 bpm. IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 3rd EEG in our lab.  None have identified sharp waves or epileptiform activity.
