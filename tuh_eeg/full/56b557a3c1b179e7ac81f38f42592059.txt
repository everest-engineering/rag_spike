History:	74 year old man who will undergo a right carotid artery stenting today.
Medications:	N/A
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and
subtemporal chain, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-12 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
intermittent premature QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23- minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
