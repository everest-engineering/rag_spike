History:	75 year old man with a history of seizures, TBI, stroke, left sided craniotomy, now
presents with confusion and falls.
Medications:	Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Voltages are diffusely slow.  The background consists of unstable 9 Hz polymorphic alpha
posteriorly, weak AP gradient and excess theta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by increase in
diffuse theta activity.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity at higher amplitudes is present in the right anterior temporal
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an
irregular heart rate at >100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Cardiac arrhythmia
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Low voltage
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization and continuous moderate right temporal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is
indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular
heart rate at >100 bpm.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
