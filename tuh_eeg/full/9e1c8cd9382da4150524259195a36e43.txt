DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG exhibits a normal sleep pattern with 10 Hz, 25 V posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient sleeps during the day and there is a disrupted sleep pattern at night.  There is abundant stage II sleep exhibiting K complexes, spindles, and vertex waves.  Also, a generous amount of POSTS were visualized.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for a subject of this age.  Abundant stage II sleep pattern seen.
