History:	76 Y M ADMITTED FOR DIFFICULTY SPEAKING, NOW RESOLVED. POSSIBLE
TIA, SZ. HX: HTN
Medications:	No AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Very frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase
reversal and amplitude maximum at F7/T1.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, abundant, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, abundant, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
in the left anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic
focus in this region,  and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are supportive for a diagnosis
of localization-related epilepsy.
