Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than
right) regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  A single fragment of a generalized
frontally-maximal spikes and wave is seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, single, Fragment
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of a fragment of a bifrontal
synchronous spike-and-wave.  These findings can be consistent with a diagnosis of primary
generalized epilepsy. Lastly there is  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
