CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old, right-handed woman with recurrent seizures and
headache. White matter changes in the MRI of the brain but not C spine.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed.in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized
with 11 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes up to 80 microvolts. There is a small
amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Brief drowsiness is characterized by
background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits supra harmonic driving. Hyperventilation
does not activate the record. At the very close of the record stage 2 sleep is captured
with vertex waves, posts and spindles. Sleep is not sustained.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
