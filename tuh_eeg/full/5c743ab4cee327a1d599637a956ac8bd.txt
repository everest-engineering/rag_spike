History:	79 year old woman who presents with change in mental status and episodic gaze
deviation to the right.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate
amplitude theta and delta activity.  There is relative paucity of faster frequencies over the right.
Additionally, lower voltages are noted over the right hemisphere.  These changes are especially
pronounced over the frontotemporal region.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No electrographic seizures are captured.  Patient has nearly continuous gaze deviation throughout
the recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is frequent movement artifact.
There is no clear EKG tracing throughout the recording - patient moves too much to fix the EKG
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric, especially frontotemporal
Attenuation, continuous, mild, right hemispheric, especially frontotemporal region
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 25-minute portable awake-only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that is
more pronounced over the right. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and attenuation over the
right is suggestive of a focal structural lesion in this region.  No electrographic seizures are
captured.  Patient has nearly continuous gaze deviation throughout the recording.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology consult team.
