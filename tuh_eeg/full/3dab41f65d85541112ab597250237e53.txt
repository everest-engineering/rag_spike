CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 27-year-old woman with thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension for hypothermic treatment and intraoperative thrombectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, sevoflurane, isoflurane, vecuronium, fentanyl, epinephrine, Amytal.
INTRODUCTION:  4-hour digital EEG was performed in the OR using standard 10-20 system with CEA montage.  One channel EKG was employed.  The tech was in the OR during the procedure with remote physician review and physician backup throughout the procedure.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient is awake in the OR just after 1 p.m.  With the induction of the anesthesia, the EEG transitions to a pattern with generous beta and delta.  There was significant artifact noted as the surgeons manipulate the patient's cranium to reposition the patient.
Cooling begins at 3:40 and the EEG transitions to initially a burst suppression pattern.
The EEG becomes progressively suppressed.
The target temperature was 19.6 degrees.
By 4 p.m., the EEG is increasingly low voltage and suppressed.  The target temperature of 20 degrees was achieved at 4:35 and the patient is placed on cardiac bypass.  In the period of time between 4:30 and 4:37, the EEG gradually become suppressed with some ICU artifacts in the EEG as suppressed by 4:37.
Recording continues throughout the procedure.  The patient is taken off cardiac bypass at 5:35 and rewarming begins at 6 p.m.  The EEG recording is discontinued at that time prior to completion of the rewarming process.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this operative procedure which utilized hypothermia was remarkable for the achievement of a suppressed pattern.
