History:	65 Y/O FEMALE L HANDED.PT HAS BEEN HERE SINCE 5-30-15 WITH CHG.IN
MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN, CEFEPIME
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left posterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At times sharply countoured.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 102.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, posterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left posterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural
in origin.In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
