37 year old man with seizures since 2005
keppra, dilantin, flexeril, prilosec, albuterol, restoril, zoloft None
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at intermediate flash rates.

Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
