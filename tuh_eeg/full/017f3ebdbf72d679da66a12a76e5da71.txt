CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old left handed woman with involuntary movements since age 6 with dizziness and headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Dizziness and involuntary movements.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient goes into stage I sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and at F8/T4 independently, at times sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
