History:	61 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF FALL AND HIT HEAD.. NO LOC. PER PT COULD
NOT MOVE LIMBS AND JUST FELL COULD NOT STOP SELF.  PMHX:  ANXIETY,
DEPRESSION, THYROID, EMBOLISM AND THROMBOSIS, DM
Medications:	XANAX, PROZAC, BENTYL, EFFEXOR, DILACOR, HCTZ, SYNTHROID, METADATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
