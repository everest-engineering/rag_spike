History:	69 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O STATUS EPILEPTICUS,NOTED WITH 5
WIT, SZ. PMHX. H/O SZ. AND POSS.STROKE? 67 CM HEAD
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Background
activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity, with absence of the normal anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at O1 and T4.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60  technical difficulties: A T3 electrode artifact is noted
causing an atypical field at T3.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left occipital
Sharp waves, rare, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate occasional epileptiform discharges in the right
midtemporal and left occipital region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic
focus in this region,  and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis
of localization-related epilepsy. In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.  This finding
is indicative of mild cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
