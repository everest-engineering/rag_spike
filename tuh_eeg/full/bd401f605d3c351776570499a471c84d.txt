LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Approximately 1 hour.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures, hepatitis C, asthma, bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia who now presents for a follow-up EEG.  Last seizure was approximately 8 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Zofran, Carafate, Reglan, Claritin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well-formed and modulated 9.5-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are noted as well.  Intermittent polymorphic theta activity at high amplitudes is noted over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and does not result in significant changes in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild left temporal slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to intermittent mild left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
