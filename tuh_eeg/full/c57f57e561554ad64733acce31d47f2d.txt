CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old with epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and vitamin B deficiency.  Seizure-free for 8 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Risperdal, Desyrel, Celexa, Benadryl, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1-hour sleep-deprived EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was extremely drowsy.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is very low voltage.  A glimpse of a 10-hertz alpha rhythm was noted and was accompanied by generous background beta.  Hyperventilation increase the amplitude of the background.  Following hyperventilation, the patient became somewhat drowsy, and in drowsiness, there is rare, rhythmic slowing from the left central temporal region.
Despite the patient's complaints that he is very tired and cannot stay awake, he remains relatively awake throughout the 1 hour EEG.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 1 hour EEG is remarkable for:
A low voltage pattern.
Generous beta.
Very limited, rhythmic slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite this sleep deprivation, it was not possible to achieve deeper stages of sleep for this individual.  To more completely evaluate this patient's epileptiform activity, a more prolonged study may be of value.
