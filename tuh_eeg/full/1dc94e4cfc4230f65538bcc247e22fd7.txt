History:	41 YR OLD  MALE WITH PMHX OF SZS. PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP
Medications:	TOPAMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional brief generalized frontally central -maximal 4 Hz spike-and-
wave discharges occur during the recording.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent fronto central predominant
generalized spike-and-wave, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise
normal.  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
