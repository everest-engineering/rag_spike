History:	63 year old woman with 2 reported seizures that occurred ~ 3 weeks ago.  Patient
has a history of stroke, HTN, bipolar disorder.
Medications:	Amlodipine,Keppra,Loratadine, Metoprolol,Trazodone
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 8 Hz theta activity that attenuates with eyes
opening.  There is AP gradient.  Diffuse excess theta activity is present.  No normal sleep
architecture is present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  There is a possible error in the distance measurement
between T5-O1 electrode pair since the activity there appears to be excessively attenuated when
viewed in the longitudinal bipolar montage.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.
