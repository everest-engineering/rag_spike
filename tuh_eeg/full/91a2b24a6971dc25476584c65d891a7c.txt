Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen. There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with
visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording. The last hour of the EEG were performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity. No normal

Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral  inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an isoelectric EEG performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity. This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.
