CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 41-year-old man with past medical history of seizures since the age of 16 characterized by loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  The last seizure was approximately 1 week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient cannot recall.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 11.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No sleep is captured.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at moderate to high flash frequencies.  Occasional P3 electrode artifact is captured.  EKG artifact is present.  Heart rate up to 100 to 110 beats per minute is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 21 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for epilepsy persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
