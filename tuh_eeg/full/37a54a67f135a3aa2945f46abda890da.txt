CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old female with history of diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid problems that fell, striking the posterior part of her head, since then has had continued memory problems, dizziness, as well as headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Levothyroxine, Enalapril
REASON FOR STUDY:  Intermittent dizziness and headaches.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is some C3/T4 intermittent electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a mildly increased amount of diffuse beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  However, there is nice photic driving.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and at times at T4 independently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral midtemporal regions, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
