CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old male with hepatitis-C, epilepsy, dementia, admitted with upper respiratory tract infection and recurrent complex partial seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was quite grumpy. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing beings, the patient is drowsy with primarily a theta frequency background. There are bursts of frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity but there is an asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere compared to the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal with an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz although there is asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with the alpha rhythm.

HR: 78 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Occasional right greater than left frontal delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing and disorganization Is more prominent than that seen in previous studies. Overall this is more of a bi-hemispheric process than a unilateral process. No epileptiform features were identified.
