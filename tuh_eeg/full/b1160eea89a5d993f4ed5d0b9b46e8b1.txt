CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old male with epilepsy, last seizure 1 month ago with loss of consciousness and falling from the chair.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax and Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed with poor effort.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically satisfactory, routine awake and drowsy EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.  A single burst of hypersynchronous theta was noted as the patient drifted off to sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation produced bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Additional EEG recording will be undertaken to more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy.
