History:	39 year old man who presents with a seizure.
Medications:	OXYCODONE,XANAX,DILANTIN,MORPHINE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The background consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic 10-11 Hz alpha activity, weak AP
gradient and occasional polymorphic theta activity.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Patient
rapidly transitions from wakefulness to sleep.  Symmetrical sleep spindles, vertex waves and sleep
spindles are captured.
Right and left leg movements are captured during sleep.  They have no abnormal EEG correlate.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization, mild
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a very mildly abnormal awake and asleep portable 21-minute EEG due to very mild diffuse
slowing and disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, but, in this patient, they could be related to excessive drowsiness, given how
rapidly patient transitions from wakefulness to sleep.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Right and left leg movements are
captured during sleep.  They have no abnormal EEG correlate.
