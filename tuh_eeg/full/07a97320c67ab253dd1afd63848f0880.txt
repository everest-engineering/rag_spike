AGE: 27 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/24/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1726
HISTORY:
27 y.o. female with a history of four seizures (described as eyes open, generalized shaking lasting a couple minutes) and childhood epilepsy (last seizure: 20 years ago) referred for routine EEG after seizure.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, Gabapentin
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The record opens to sleep. Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, Â·sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
During brief periods of wakefulness (<20 seconds at a time), the background is characterized by a fairly well organized mixture of theta, alpha, and beta frequencies, with no definite posterior dominant rhythm.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements and further background slowing are seen.
There is mild generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal drowsy and asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
