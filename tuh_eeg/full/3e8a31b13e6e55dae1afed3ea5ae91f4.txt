History:	50yo M with refractory localization-related epilepsy due to right mesial temporal sclerosis.
Admitted yesterday for breakthrough seizures. Now here for EEG monitoring for pre? surgical evaluation.


Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:


Tegretol XR 800mg BID, phenobarbital 60mg HS, Lisinopril, nicotine patch

Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

Intermittent, independent bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing, right more than left. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR 90

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) temporal, anterior No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and asleep due to intermittent, independent bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing, right more than left. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild focal cerebral dysfunction in those regions.
