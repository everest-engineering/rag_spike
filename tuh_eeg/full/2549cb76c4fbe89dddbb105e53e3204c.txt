CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old female with history of diabetes, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, subcuticular arthritis, and hypertension presents with change of mental status and frequent falls.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Insulin, Furosemide, Lisinopril, Metformin, Nifedipine, Seroquel, Ativan, Ceftriaxone, Haldol
REASON FOR EEG:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The recording was performed during wakefulness.
No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is continuous movement artifact during the recording as well as continuous muscle artifact over mainly the frontal lobes and temporal lobes which greatly obscure the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording is opening onto a disorganized background with a posterior dominant rhythm that best reaches 6 Hz which does not appear to react to eye opening or closing.  There is no normal frontal central beta.
Please note again there is diffuse frontal muscle artifact which makes the interpretation difficult.  No clear sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz are seen, continues within the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild diffuse generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or overt epileptiform discharges are seen.  If the concern for seizures persist, a repeat EEG with mild sedation may aid in obtaining a recording with less movement artifact.
