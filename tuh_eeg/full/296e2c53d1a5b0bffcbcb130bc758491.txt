History:	57 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF GEN WEAKNESS AND BODY SHAKING.  (PER PT
WAS PARALYZED.  NO LOC. PMHX: FIBROMYALGIA, OBESITY, DM, HTN,
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYND, CVA, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, OSA
Medications:	GABAPENTIN, FLEXERIL, PERCOCET, PROZAC,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was at best 8Hz  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
