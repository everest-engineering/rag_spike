CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 40 -year-old right-handed male patient who presents with clonic movement of the left foot, status post craniotomy on the right side.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Fentanyl.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient had a tracheostomy.  He was responsive and somewhat agitated during the EEG recording.  He had a recent craniectomy on the right side.  Impedances were difficult and there was blood on the scalp.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG recording is remarkable for asymmetry between the 2 sides, the right slower than the left.  The left hemisphere is characterized by 3 stretches of alpha activity in the 9 Hz range.  The activity on the left side is low voltage, but at times there is a reactive alpha rhythm.  At other times, there is more of a low voltage theta pattern.  The right hemisphere is characterized by higher amplitude continuous mixed delta and theta.  There is more prominent right frontocentral delta which is higher in amplitude and 2 to 3 Hz in frequency.  Sleep was not achieved.

Heart rate:  120 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:

1. Lots of faster frequency activity on the right hemisphere with continuous focal delta on the right.
2. Mild slowing seen on the left hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These EEG findings are congruent with right-sided structural abnormality.  The left hemisphere was relatively preserved.  The patient's episodes of shaking the bed had no EEG correlate.  These behaviors are not seizures.

Attestation: I personally reviewed the EEG with the trainee and agree with the report.
