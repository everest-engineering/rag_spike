CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman who had a fainting spell and hit
her head. History of cavernoma.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep
record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well
organized with a high amplitude 11 Hz alpha rhythm, generous low voltage,
frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by intermittent
hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing as well as an increase in beta. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in amplitude in the background. Two bursts of left temporal focal
delta are observed as are some artifacts in the same region.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 2 bursts of left temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. The delta may
be related to this patient's cavernoma.
