CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with a history of an aneurysm clipping status post right frontocentral craniotomy who developed seizures afterwards with his last seizure about three months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Dilantin, Benzonatate, Omeprazole, Motrin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with  additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep stage 1, stage 2 was recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed as well as hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The majority of the recording is in sleep, stage 1 and stage 2, with limited wakefulness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation revealed normal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the right hemisphere, maximal in the frontotemporal region, which is frequent.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontotemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of right frontotemporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with the known history of surgery in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
