History:	29 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF HEADACHES/ OVER RIGHT EYE AND SHAKING OF
RUE. ONSET LAST YR. HEADACHES EVERY DAY.  SHAKING HAPPENS EVERY
COUPLE MONTHS AND LASTS SECONDS.
Medications:	Birth Control
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, few, mild, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of occasional focal slowing in the left mid
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
