CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed woman with 2 tonic-clonic seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Fentanyl patch, Percocet.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm,
There is a small amount of background theta. In addition, there is occasional rhythmic,
sharply contoured slowing in the right mid temporal region. This activity is accentuated
by hyperventilation. Sharply contoured slowing is seen in the right mid temporal region
and hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness Include an increase in beta. Photic
stimulation is performed while the patient is driving off to sleep. While there is a bilateral driving, it is better identified on the left and the right mid to posterior temporal focal slowing is Identified.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right mid to posterior temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a process involving the right
hemisphere and, in particular, the temporal region. Correlation with imaging is
suggested.
