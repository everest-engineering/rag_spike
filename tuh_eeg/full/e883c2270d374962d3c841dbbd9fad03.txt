History:	75 year old man with a history of seizures.  Patient was seizure-free until recently,
but in the last month he had 2 reported generalized convulsions.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low voltage 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and bursts of ~5 Hz monomorphic sharply contoured diffuse stereotyped theta activity appears.  This
activity becomes more prominent as drowsiness deepens.  No clear stage II sleep architecture is
Frequent polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the right anterior temporal region,
increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal, anterior, mild-to-moderate
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG due to frequent mild-to-moderate focal
slowing in the right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
