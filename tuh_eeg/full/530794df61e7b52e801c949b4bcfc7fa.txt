History:	59 YEAR OLD FEMALE RIGHT HANDED. PT. BROUGHT IN BY ED VIA PHILA.
EMS WITH COMPLAINTS OF POSSIBLE STROKE. FACIAL DROOP WEAKNESS
IN LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY AND IN THE LOWER LEFT EXTREMITY.PMHX HTN,
MENTAL ILLNESS, HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA.CIR 55CM.
Medications:	DILANTIN, MULTI-VIT, THIAMINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-8 Hz
activity seen in the central and frontal regions.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto-temporal region during
wakefulness, with associated loss of faster frequencies.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 108
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right frontotemporal, And loss of faster
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right fronto-temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is mild
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
