History:	85 YO FEMALE PRESENTS PASSING OUT WHILE SITTING ON COUCH. PT WAS
OUT FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BUT DID NOT LOSE BLADDER OR BOWEL. PT
REPORTS SIMILAR EPISODES 1 - 2X A YEAR AND TAKES A GLUCOSE TAB
AND OJ , SYMPTOMS RESOLVE.
Medications:	INSULIN, MIRALAX, LOVENOX, ATENOLOL, ASA, ATORVASTATIN, PLAVIX,
ISOSORBIDE, AMIODIPINE, SENNA, DOCUSATE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EEG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
