CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old male with alcohol withdrawal, previous seizure with twitching and staring, June 2013 and August 2013.  Patient subsequently went to alcohol detox program.  Admitted to Mercy Hospital 7 July, 2014 after seizure with normal brain CT, but EEG demonstrating epileptic spikes at T5 and T6.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, thiamine, and folate.

INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms and captured wakefulness through sleep with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm of 8.7 hertz, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  A small amount of wicket was also noted.  In brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates.  There are rare, subtle, bursts of shifting mixed theta delta noted in the temporal regions.  Other features of stage 1 sleep includes more rhythmic central theta.  Stage 2 sleep was not obtained.

Hyperventilation produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.

Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a very minimally abnormal 40-minute EEG due to:
1. Subtle, shifting, and slowing, as the patient becomes drowsy.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  This is the 2nd EEG without epileptiform activity.  The rare, temporal changes described above are not uncommon in older adults with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
