History:	52 year old man who was found unresponsive at home.
Medications:	ativan, vancomycin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8.5-9.5 Hz alpha
activity.  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  Sleep is
characterized by lack of EMG artifact, a mixture of frequencies and fragmented sleep spindles.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~ 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
