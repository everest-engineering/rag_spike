CLINICAL HISTORY:  63-year-old woman with epilepsy.  She had been seizure free for 30-40 years until a seizure on May 6th.  Tonic-clonic seizure with incontinence.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record and was a very challenging record.  The patient was wearing a hair weave, which could not be removed and which made electrode placement difficult.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  The waking record is disrupted by intermittent rhythmic bursts of right or left temporal focal slowing, some of which have admixed sharp waves.  Drowsiness is characterized by a prominent increase in rhythmic frontal delta.  Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep, but did elicit a driving response.  Hyperventilation produces rhythmic frontal delta as well as some sharply contoured delta, particularly from the right temporal region with the previously described sharp waves.
Heart Rate:  66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to,
Independent bursts of right or left temporal focal slowing with some sharp waves noted within these bursts including T2/T4.
Bursts of frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Similar findings were previously described in the December 2010 EEG.  Epileptiform features were not as prominent in that EEG.  The bursts of frontal slowing may be evaluated clinically.  In this individual with a complex history, a repeat study after the patient has removed her hair weave is suggested.
