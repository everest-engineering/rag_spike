EEG REMARKS: 
pt had 2 events last night, back-to-back, at ~ 9:22 PM and ~ 9:26 pm.  Normal background immediately prior, between and after the episodes.  Clinically episodes start suddenly and pt just thrushes around chaotically and then appears slow to respond after the episodes.  Otherwise normal wake and asleep study – if captured events are typical for this pt, then continuous monitoring no longer needed
