History:	22 year old woman status post acute traumatic brain injury.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, obtunded
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm is weak and unstable and consists of polymorphic 9-10 Hz alpha
activity with poor AP gradient.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present.  Patient
remains awake throughout the recording.
Continuous monomorphic moderate delta activity is present over the bilateral posterior temporal
regions and left anterior temporal region and frequent polymorphic delta activity is present over
right parietocentral region.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate close to ~120 bpm.  There is frequent movement and EMG artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, anterior, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right, moderate, right parieto-central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral temporal, posterior, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 27 minute EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing and
disorganization; (2) continuous bilateral moderate-to-severe posterior temporal focal slowing; (3)
continuous moderate-to-severe left anterior temporal focal slowing and (4) intermittent moderate
right parietocentral focal slowing.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific.  Multifocal focal slowing indicates multiple focal structural
abnormalities.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  Frequent movement and EMG
artifact limit interpretation of the recording.
