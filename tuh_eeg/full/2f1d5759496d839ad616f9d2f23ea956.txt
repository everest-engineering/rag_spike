CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old right handed woman recently hospitalized with myoclonus and behavioral issues.  Rehospitalized with agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Opioids, Cannabis, Xanax, Ativan, Haldol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel.  There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.  The patient was able to drift into stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is generous beta.  There is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness into very brief epochs of stage 2 sleep and there is theta just prior to the transition into stage 2 sleep with vertex wave spindles, and then sleep is not sustained.
HR:    108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Overall, this appears to be a very sleep deprived patient.  There is some theta, but with these rapid transitions into sleep.  A sleep disturbance could account for the microsleeps described above.  No epileptiform features were noted and there were no specific hallmarks of any sort of neurological syndrome.
