CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right handed male with poorly controlled seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.  It also accentuates subtle and well-defined left anterior temporal sharp waves with the maximum at F7, T1.  Following hyperventilation, there is some rhythmic repetitive 5 Hz activity but this is followed by an after-going slow wave.  In the transition to sleep, there is some shifting slowing.  There are also some subtle left anterior temporal sharp waves noted, and again F7 maximum.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves identified in wakefulness, drowsiness, and hyperventilation.
Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Compared to a previous study, the epileptiform activity is much better defined today.  This EEG supports a localization mechanism for epilepsy.
