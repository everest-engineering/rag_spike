CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old right-handed male, hospitalized for subdural hematoma in November, readmitted December 3rd with recurrent seizures/status epilepticus, currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Klonopin, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There is no mention made of previous craniotomy defect.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with impedances generally under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a low voltage pattern with a low voltage 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Shifting slowing was identified and was present in maximal wakefulness while the technologist was testing the patient with serial sevens.  The shifting slowing can be seen in the left frontotemporal or right centrotemporal region and is a little bit more remarkable, a bit more paroxysmal and irregular in the left temporal region.  Features of sleep include rhythmic theta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, left temporal focal slowing is a bit more prominent.  Brief spindles were noted in early stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.
Heart rate 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Shifting slowing, left temporal and right central.
In the transition to drowsiness, more clear-cut pattern of intermittent left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  There were no definitive epileptiform discharges.  Of note, this patient had previous EEG monitoring, which did not identify epileptiform activity, recorded immediately after the episode of status epilepticus.
