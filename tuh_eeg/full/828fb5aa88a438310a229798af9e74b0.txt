DISC DISEASE
Medications:	KEPPRA, VECURONIUM, HEPARIN, ACETAMINOPHEN, HUMULIN, KAYEXALATE,
SORBITOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 22 hours from 8AM 02/16/2014 to 6AM 02/17/2014.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation
of the EEG was available at the bedside for continuous review by EEG technologists.  Ongoing raw
EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes
in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies and an overriding alpha discharge seen diffusely.  The diffuse alpha discharge has
become more prominent and clear during this record.  There less variability in the background
during this record.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No electrographic seizures
were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No tests of reactivity (visual, auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli) are performed.  HR was 140's irregular.EKG electrode low amplitude.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22 hours EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. The diffuse alpha may be due to medication effect.  No electrographic seizures are present
