CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old, former premature baby weighing 1 kg.  Profound mental retardation, cerebral palsy, scoliosis, severe obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient was diagnosed with depression and hallucinations a year ago.  Now she has episodes with crying, laughing, or inappropriate behavior, as well as cursing.  These episodes occur between 3 and 4 p.m. and at 2 a.m.
MEDICATIONS:  Baclofen, Ativan, melatonin, many others, Zanaflex.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an extremely challenging EEG for a patient who was moving constantly and was very poorly cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Throughout much of the waking background, the EEG is low voltage and featureless, but rare epochs at 10 Hz alpha rhythm identified.  The remainder of the awake record is more of a low voltage rhythmic theta pattern.  Other sections of the record include morbid diffuse beta pattern.
Hyperventilation could not be performed.  Photic stimulation was attempted and did elicit a driving response.  Harmonic and super harmonic driving was noted.
Heart rate 108.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging but abnormal EEG due to an abnormal background with intermittent pattern of rhythmic theta or rhythmic beta.
Clinical correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Of note, in this technically very challenging record, there were sections of the record where an alpha rhythm was identified.  Consequently, the degree of encephalopathy here, at least as measured by the EEG, is a bit unclear and it is possible that this patient might have a more vigorous alpha rhythm than was otherwise identified today.  In any case, overall the EEG supports a significant bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, congruent with the clinical picture.
