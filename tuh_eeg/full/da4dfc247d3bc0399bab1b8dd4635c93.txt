CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old male with small bowel obstruction, stroke, hepatic encephalopathy, aphasia, HIV disease.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilaudid, Dilantin, Pantoprazole, Prilosec, Seroquel, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly suppressed with low voltage beta. There is a scant amount of low voltage/mixed theta-delta, primarily with 3 Hz delta activity and a smaller amount of 6 Hz theta. In this low voltage record, this activity is more prominent on the left. Using lower sensitivity, very slow periodic slowing can be noted in the left hemisphere with a subtle left frontotemporal sharp wave. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact. As recording continues, a simple morphology sharp wave can be identified with some variability sometimes maximum FP/F7 and other times F3. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact.

HR: 114 bpm

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage slow suppressed record.
2. A bit more suppression of activity on the right compared to the left.
3. A left frontal or frontotemporal sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports localization related mechanism for epilepsy. There is marked background slowing which may be evaluated clinically.
