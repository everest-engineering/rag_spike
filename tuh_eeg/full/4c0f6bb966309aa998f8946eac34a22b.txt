CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 26-year-old woman G6P3, expecting her fourth child, with multiple episodes of loss of consciousness.  Currently being evaluated for seizures â€“ normal MRI.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Continuous seizure and spike detection software is employed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a symmetric, reactive 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The sleep record includes generous stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The patient has eye movement noted in stage II sleep.
HR:  80 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal 24-hour video EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Of note, this patient occasionally seemed to unplug her EEG monitor.  This may have been simply a nervous habit on her part. She also had eye movements into stage II sleep, which is a non-specific finding and can be due to medications, anxiety, and depression.
