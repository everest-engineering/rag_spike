CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 40-year-old woman with vasculitis and recurrent syncopal spells, evaluate for epilepsy.  Mononeuritis multiplex, morbid obesity, and obstructive sleep apnea.
MEDICATIONS:  Glucophage, iron, many others, pyridoxine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was  a technically satisfactory, routine 20-minute EEG with impedances below 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Stage 1 sleep includes vertex waves.  Vertex waves and spindles are seen in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation did not significantly produce a driving response.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and, if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep can be considered.
