PMHX- HIV, UNSPECIFIED HEPATITIS, DYSPHAGIA,HTN,CONVULSIONS
Medications:	HUMULIN,OXYCODONE,FUROSEMIDE,METOPROLOL,PANTOPRAZOLE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, obtunded, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 7Hz activity during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness,
the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform discharges were
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
