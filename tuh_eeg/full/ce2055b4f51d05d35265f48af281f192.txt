HISTORY: A 44 -year-old woman with epilepsy since 2003. History of an
inoperable aneurysm diagnosed in 1998. Seizure-free for the last 4 months but typical
seizures are tonic-clonic in nature. Past J-tube, G-tube, ileostomy.
MEDICATIONS: Opana, Benadryl, Ambien, Topamax, Nexium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm
identified bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include slow-rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of background slowing. Photic stimulation
elicits a scant driving response. Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and comparison with this patient's previous
studies may be of value.
