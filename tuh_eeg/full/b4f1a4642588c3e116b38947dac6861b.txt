History:	22 YO FEMALE R HANDED WITH HISTORY OF SEIZURES.  NO SEIZURES SINCE
FEB 2014. HAS NOT SEEN A NEUROLOGIST IN 2YEARS.
Medications:	Lamictal
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  There is excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is subtle diffuse background slowing in the theta
range that may reflect drowsiness although it persists during periods of maximal wakefulness.  During
brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces no appreciable photic
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, intermittent diffuse
Beta, excessive diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to excessive beta activity and mild diffuse
slowing. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Excessive beta
activity may result from a medication effect such as a benzodiazepine. Diffuse slowing may result
from a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
