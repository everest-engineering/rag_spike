CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult male admitted on November 24th, after being found by the police with a bottle of Hennessy.  He reportedly provided a name before requiring intubation for a right subcortical hemorrhage.  Past history of frontal encephalomalacia.  Past history of alcohol or posttraumatic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed, propofol, Keppra, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was awake and restless, but answered questions appropriately.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the patient's difficulty following commands, at times a 12 Hz alpha rhythm could be identified bilaterally which was reactive to eye opening.  Generous beta was noted.  Intermittent focal slowing with lower voltage rhythmic delta was noted in the right posterior quadrant.  This was relatively low voltage, intermittent slowing.  There is a scant amount of lower voltage slowing in the frontal regions, left greater than right.
Heart rate 104 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Intermittent, focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant and rare frontal theta, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite the history described above, the patient is remarkably awake with well-formed alpha.  The focal slowing is more subtle than one would expect given the intracerebral hemorrhage.  The frontal features are also relatively subtle given the past frontal encephalomalacia.  No epileptiform features were identified.  No previous EEGs were available for this individual.
