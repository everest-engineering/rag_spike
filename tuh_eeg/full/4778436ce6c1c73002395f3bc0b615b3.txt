CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old right-handed male with change in mental status and excessive drowsiness.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The overall background is somewhat slow and disorganized with a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Intermittent slowing was noted in the left hemisphere, which was somewhat rhythmic and at times sharply contoured.  As the recording continues, the patient was a bit more alert with a bit more theta frequency activity.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Background slowing.
Disorganization.
Superimposed left hemispheric focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous EEG recording of January 2012.  No seizures were recorded.  The left-sided focal features have been previously identified.
