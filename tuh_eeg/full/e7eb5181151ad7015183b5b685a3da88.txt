CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old man status post PEA code cardiac arrest for an unknown time and myoclonus now for follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, Zosyn, Dopamine, Heparin, Bumetanide, Propofol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Unresponsiveness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive and comatose.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a severely attenuated background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  About 55 seconds after starting the recording, the nurse turned off propofol medication.  The background appears to have a marked amount of ICU artifact, which makes it difficult to discern underlying activity, especially at a sensitivity of 2 mV per mm.  During the recording the patient stimulated and there was no clear change or reactivity to the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves with a marked low amplitude recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Severely attenuated EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical injury and dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  Unfortunately, the is propofol given previous to the recording marked amount of artifact which precludes the ability to make any final conclusions, lack of any electrocerebral activity.
