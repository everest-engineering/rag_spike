History:	74 year old man who presents with change in mental status.

Patient is agitated and moves throughout the study.
Medications:	Haldol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Patient moves throughout the study.  Brief PDR that is captured consists of 8-9 Hz low-to-moderate
amplitude activity with expected AP gradient.  The majority of the background consists of low
amplitude fast activity.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited, due to nearly constant movement
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because of abundant movement artifact. Otherwise
background demonstrates mild diffuse slowing that is   is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No electrographic seizures are present.
