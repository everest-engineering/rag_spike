History:	77 YO FEMALE ON ASA, PLAVIX FOR LOWER EXTREMITY PERIPHERAL
STENTS, PRESENTED AFTER FALL W/O LOC. DAUGHTER FOUND PT FACE
DOWN AFTER HEARING HER CRY OUT.
PMHX: CATARACTS, HTN, DVT, SYNCOPE.  BLEED FROM GASTRAL ULCER
Medications:	KEPPRA, MAGNESIUM SULFATE AND OXIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 15-25uV posterior dominant rhythm, that at best reaches
7-8Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity, with associated attenuation of faster frequencies is present
in the left hemisphere, maximal in the midtemporal region.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity
is present in the right midtemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 78, irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, Maximal in midtemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, right temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy and asleep due to continuous focal slowing and
attenuation of faster frequencies in the left hemisphere, which is consistent with the patient's history
of a structural cortical lesion in the region. In addition,  there is intermittent focal slowing in the
right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. Lastly,  there is diffuse background slowing.  This finding is an
etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
