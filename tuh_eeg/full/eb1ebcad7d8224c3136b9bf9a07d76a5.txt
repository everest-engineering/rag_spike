CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old gentleman from Ponce, Puerto Rico with a history of alcohol abuse. The patient has profound memory impairment for new as well as remote information. No family members can be found. Chronic dementia versus acute encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Risperdal, Thiamine, Potassium
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, this EEG demonstrates a low to medium amplitude, mixed frequency, slow pattern with generous 5-7 Hertz activity, but there is a smaller amount of delta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. On occasion there is a scant amount of alpha frequency activity in the background. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
HR: 80 bpm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific but can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function of many different causes. They are compatible with an underlying dementia.
