CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 54-year-old male, status post left craniectomy, duraplasty, and subdural hematoma, transferred with breakthrough seizures and persistent alteration in mental status.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technically challenging record.  Impedances were difficult to achieve and that the patient was complaining of great thirst and left-sided scalp pain.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a prominent asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The activity from the right is lower voltage and moderately slow.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm with a great deal of artifact, but despite this, there is a phase reversal of sharply contoured activity in the left hemisphere with a generous field of spread including T3.  There is some faster frequency activity, but the EEG activity does not significantly evolve.  The patient is interactive with focal slowing, sharp waves, and breach.

Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a technically very challenging, but markedly abnormal EEG due.
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with arrhythmic delta and disruption of faster frequency activity.
3. Despite the technical limitations described above, left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The epileptiform activity was quite prominent and may have been accentuated by the breach rhythm.  Additional EEG monitoring will be undertaken.
