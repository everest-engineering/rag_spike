REASON FOR THE STUDY:  Declining memory.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 76-year-old man with declining memory, talks to himself.  The patient also reports dizzy spells about 2-3 times per week.  Last episode was 8 months ago with fall and loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Klonopin, Glucophage, Pravachol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes and hypertension.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel of EKG.  Wakefulness was recorded during the EEG.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  There was continuous eye movement artifact in the first half of the recording, which impedes correct evaluation of the cerebral activity in the frontal leads.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz frequency, 30-50 microvolts in amplitude, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is excess theta noted in the frontal leads in the section without the eye movement artifact.
Sleep was not achieved during the recording.
Hyperventilation was performed, which did not bring about significant change in the recording.
Photic stimulation did not elicit any changes in the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional T3 focal slow waves at 2-4 Hz in frequency and 50-70 microvolts in amplitude.
Mildly excess theta in the frontal leads.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Left mid temporal intermittent slowing.
Mildly excess theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region which is non-specific with regards to etiology.  The excess theta in the frontal leads may indicate drowsiness or a mild diffuse encephalopathy.
