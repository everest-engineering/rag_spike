History:	48 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX: TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMP., AND SEIZURES.
WHICH HAVE SLOWED IN LAST DECADE. AND CVA WITH EXPRESSIVE
APHASIA.    NEURO EVAL.
Medications:	DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Very frequent polymorphic and at times short (1.5 seconds) prominent monomorphic delta activity is
present in the left central and frontal regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Occasional focal spikes and sharp waves are present in the left central and frontal region, with
phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F3 and C3, at times F7.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left frontal, and central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontal, and central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of focal sharp waves and slowing in the left
frontal and central region. This is supportive of an irritable potentially epileptogenic structural
lesion in that region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
