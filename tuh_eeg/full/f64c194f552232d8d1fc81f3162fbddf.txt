REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of loss of consciousness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old obese woman with an episode of loss of consciousness in October of 2012.  She states she woke up on the floor after 1 or 2 minutes of loss of consciousness.  She denies this ever happening before.  She has a past medical history hypertension and a head circumference of 54 cm.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive eye opening.  There is some excessive frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage 1 and stage 2.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right mid temporal focal slowing.
Heart rate 60.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to the etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
