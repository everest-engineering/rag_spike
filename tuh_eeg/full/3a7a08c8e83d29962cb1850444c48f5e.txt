Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal region
during wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
