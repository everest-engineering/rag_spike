CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old, who had hot flashes, brief syncopal episode with left shoulder injury, patient unconscious for 1 minute and then vomited.  History of alcohol abuse, bipolar disease, schizophrenia.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically acceptable bedside record with most impedances of under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low-voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Drowsiness produces slow rolling eye movements and mild attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
