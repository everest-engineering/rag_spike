REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety who presented to the hospital after having a tingling sensation in the toes, fingers and mouth, and later had urinary incontinence.

MEDICATIONS:  Atropine, lorazepam, Lovenox, Zoloft, Klonopin.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.  The excessive beta noted during the recording may be seen in relation to medications like benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
