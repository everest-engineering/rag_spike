CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old male presented approximately 12 hours ago, status post PEA code down 1 hour found unresponsive, pulseless with tox screen positive for opiates and cocaine.  Now intubated, unresponsive with rapid respirations and head bobbing as well as abnormal LFTs, elevated ammonia, and impaired renal function.
MEDICINES:  Norepinephrine, Levophed, epinephrine, Narcan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  2-hour digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Because of the involuntary movements, vecuronium was administered.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate a chaotic pattern with high amplitude activity, head bobbing and triphasic waves.  Intermittent attenuation of the background is noted with attenuation lasting up to 10 seconds.  Vecuronium was given at noon and the recording continues for more than an hour afterwards.  With the vecuronium there, the EEG continues to demonstrate a chaotic pattern with irregular triphasic waves noted in both hemispheres.  Intermittent attenuation of the background is noted with duration up to 10 seconds.  Notched frontal delta (FIRDA) was noted in some sections of the record.
Tactile stimulation does not seem to activate the record.
Heart rate:  97 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
At times discontinuous pattern with suppression lasting up to 10 seconds.
An otherwise chaotic background.
Triphasic waves.
Frontal irregular rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These features may be seen in the context of an anoxic encephalopathy or severe metabolic encephalopathy.  No electrographic seizures were recorded.  Given the markedly abnormal EEG, a follow up study will be performed on the 28th.
