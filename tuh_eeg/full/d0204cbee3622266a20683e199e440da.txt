History:	27 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ ONSET AT AGE 14. CPS, PT
STATES THAT SHE HAS BEEN SZ FREE FOR YEARS, CAN'T RECALL LAST SZ.
Medications:	TOPAMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  There is a short sleep latency.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional brief 0.5-1 seconds bursts of symmetric generalized
frontally-maximal 4.5 Hz spike-and-wave discharges occur during the recording.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, intermittent generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of generalized spike-and-wave
discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise normal.  These
findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.  In the proper clinical
context, the presence of generalized spikes and polyspikes suggests the diagnosis of Juvenile
Myoclonic Epilepsy.  The short sleep latency may signify a sleep disturbance. A sleep evaluation
may be beneficial if clinically indicated.
