CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and increase in theta and some hyperparoxysmal slowing. POSTS are observed in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response with a photic paroxysmal response at 11 Hz.
HR: 78 bpm, irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1. Photic paroxysmal response.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The photoparoxysmal response with some discreet spike and wave activity at 11 Hz can be an inherent trait. No focal features were noted.
