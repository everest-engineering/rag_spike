REASON FOR STUDY:  Aphasia, ischemic stroke.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old man with hypoxemia aphasia and ischemic stroke without thrombolysis.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior lead temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep mainly in sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is seen to reach 9 Hz and is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There was some frontocentral beta also seen better over the right hemisphere.  The patient is recorded mainly in sleep and activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Frequent focal slowing seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2/4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:
He has frequent premature ventricular complexes.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals significance of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region which may be related to the known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
