REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old man with a history of Bell's palsy, right MCA stroke and slurred speech now with transient episodes of staring and lethargy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, Benadryl, lorazepam, lisinopril, daptomycin, Seroquel, and Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakeful and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.  performed.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz only seen over the left hemisphere.  There is also some frontocentral beta only seen over the left hemisphere.  The patient appears to be recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Photic stimulation processes no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves and attenuation seen over the right hemisphere, maximal in the anterior temporal region at F8/T4 seen continuously at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate: 120, irregular with some ventricular beats.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous focal slowing over the right hemisphere, maximal in the right anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction over the right hemisphere, maximal in the anterior temporal region which is consistent with the known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
