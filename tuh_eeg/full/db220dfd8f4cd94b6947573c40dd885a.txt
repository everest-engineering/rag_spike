CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed woman with childhood epilepsy, seizure free since the age of 9 or 10.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG. Hyperventilation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record which produces head rocking artifact. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic theta in the background.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified. Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a normal phenomenon. If this individual is thought to have subtle seizures, a more prolonged study or sleep deprived study may be helpful looking for a generalized spike and wave activity.
