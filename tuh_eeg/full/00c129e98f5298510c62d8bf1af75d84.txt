CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old woman with recurrent syncope associated with chest pain, shortness of breath.  Past history of aneurysm clipped in 2010 in the right cranium and migraine headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Toradol, Fioricet, Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage.  Much of the EEG includes stage 1 or stage 2 sleep with POSTs, vertex waves and spindles.  A breach rhythm is noted in wakefulness and sleep with higher amplitude activity in the right frontocentral region.  In the wakefulness, there is 10 Hz alpha rhythm, high amplitude on the left than the right and then the patient transitions back into sleep.  In that transition, a skull defect is noted in the right frontal region with electrode artifact as well as accentuation of the breach and a bit of right frontocentral focal slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.
HR:    90 BPM
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
A breach rhythm.
Subtle focal slowing in the right frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  The focal slowing is in the region of the patient's previous surgery.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be of use.
