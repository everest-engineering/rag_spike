HISTORY: 61 year old left handed female with past medical history of Ml,
stent in 1998, left carotid endarterectomy in 1999, CVA in 2000, with right sided
weakness.
MEDICATIONS: Amlodipine, Pravastatin, Klor, Warfarin, Furosemide, Enalapril
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a 9.3 Hz alpha
with shifting slowing in the left temporal region. Features of drowsiness are
hypersynchronous bursts. Photic stimulation generates a driving response, in addition
to some sporadic shifting delta activity. There is no epileptiform activity in this record.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for age due to:
1. Shifting slowing.
2. Occasional delta activity.
CLINICAL The features of shifting slowing and occasional delta
activity may be associated with bi-hemispheric pathology. Correlation imaging is
suggested.
