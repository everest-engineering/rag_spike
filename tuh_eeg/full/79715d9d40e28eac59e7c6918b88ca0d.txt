CLINICAL HISTORY:   49 year old male found with confusion.  With 2 seizures, hepatitis cirrhosis, markedly icteric.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Metoprolol, Prograf.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND:  The background EEG is markedly low voltage and slow.  It is a mixture of low voltage beta at 15 Hz with smaller amounts of 2 to 2.5 Hz delta.  Stimulation of the patient produced a small amount of theta.  There is snore artifact.
HR:    108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
Prominent delta.
Prominent beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This electroencephalogram is compatible with a severe underlying encephalopathy.  Stimulation of the patient does produce reactivity.  A slow delta may be part of this patient's metabolic encephalopathy.  The beta reflects exposure to benzodiazepines.
