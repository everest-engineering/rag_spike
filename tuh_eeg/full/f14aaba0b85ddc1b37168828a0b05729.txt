History: 66 year old woman with bilateral subdural hematomas.
Medications: PRILOSEC. ZOFRAN, PROTONIX, OXYCODONE, METOPROLOL, NEURONTIN, NORVASC, ACYCLOVIR, CITALOPRAM
Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep. Portable.
Technique: international 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION
The posterior dominant rhythm Is unstable and reaches 9 Hz polymorphic alpha activity The anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient is weak. The background consists primarily of mixture of polymorphic variable amplitude theta, delta and occasional alpha activity. Frequent brief (2Â·5 second) bursts of 10Q.200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording. Increasing in frequency during drowsiness (FIRDA). Symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are noted.
No consistent focal slowing is observed. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild, mid-to-moderate
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
No epileptiform discharges
Disorganization
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG due to mild-moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization. These findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. FIRDA could be seen in encephalopathy, bilateral deep white matter lesions and increased intracranial pressure. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
