CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with prostate cancer, cervical degenerative joint disease, admitted with possible seizure, past history of left frontal parietal encephalomalacia, alcohol abuse, cerebral atherosclerosis, and new onset seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, Flexeril, Heparin, Insulin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a bedside record.  The patient was somewhat somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is poorly organized and diffusely slow with prominent shifting slowing.  There is an alpha rhythm of 6.5 Hz, higher amplitudes on the right than the left. As the patient becomes drowsy there is a bit more focality with a bit more disruption of faster frequency activity in the left frontal central regions and rare FP1/F3 sharp waves.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing with left frontal central focal slowing in drowsiness.
Rare left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The sharp waves are ipsilateral to the encephalomalacia and support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.
