REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent episodes of shaking.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation.
MEDICATIONS:  Levothyroxine.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal Discharges:  None.
Heart rate:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy electroencephalogram.
