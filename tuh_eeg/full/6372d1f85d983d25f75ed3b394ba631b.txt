History:	78 year old man with a history of a recent left frontal meningioma resection at an OSH.  Post-operative seizures were reported.  Patient is slow to wake up, concern for subclinical seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Versed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta > theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture is present. Focal background attenuation is noted over the left frontocentral region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is nearly continuous significant EMG artifact over the right lateral leads.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Attenuation, left, frontocentral
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL 25-minute portable EEG because of moderate -to-severe diffuse background slowing and focal voltage attenuation over the left frontocentral region.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. Focal left frontocentral voltage attenuation indicates focal cerebral dysfunction over that region and a potential fluid collection over that region, such as subdural hematoma, ICH et etc.  Nearly continuous significant EMG artifact present over the right lateral leads could obscure subtle _________.
