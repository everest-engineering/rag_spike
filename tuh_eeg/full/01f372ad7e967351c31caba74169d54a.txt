CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed male status post craniectomy in October 2010, aneurysm repair.  The patient was seen in Neurology Clinic on April 27th for seizures and then again on 29th for change in mental status, increasing right-sided weakness and lethargy.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is prominent breach noted in the right central region with accentuation of faster frequency activity in this region.  The overall background is relatively low voltage and slow with prominent 4 and 8 Hz activity in the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere demonstrates more significant delta at about 2 Hz with smaller amounts of 6 Hz theta.  Despite the breach rhythm, there are occasional C4 sharp waves observed.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing.  The patient was relatively drowsy throughout the EEG.  With stimulation, there are occasional bursts of bilateral frontal delta.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Breach rhythm from the right with right central sharp waves.
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed focal slowing with a slower more featureless record on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above suggest a bihemispheric process about 1, which may involve both grey and white matter on the left.  The epileptiform focus is on the right.
