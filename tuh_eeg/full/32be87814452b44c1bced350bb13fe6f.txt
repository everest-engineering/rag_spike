CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 33-year-old male with a psychiatric history and recurrent status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Etomidate and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This EEG occurs in an intubated, acutely postictal patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of delta and generous beta.  There are frequent left anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes with rare right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes.  The patient is stimulated throughout the record and is responsive.
HR:  100 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Prominent, left greater than right temporal spike and slow or sharp and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded.  The temporal epileptiform activity is similar to that seen in previous studies.  In this particular study, there is a left greater than right predominance for the epileptiform activity.
