CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old  gentleman with renal failure, on dialysis as well as retroviral therapy admitted with right temporal cortical hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Azithromycin, Zosyn, Norvir, Baclofen, Vancomycin, Doxazosin, Calcitriol, Norvir, Enalapril, Metoprolol, Famotidine, Nifedipine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It is at times nearly a discontinuous pattern with bursts of paroxysmal high amplitude theta frequency activity.  These are followed by brief attenuations lasting 1-3 seconds with lower voltage arrhythmic delta activity.  The EEG is more suppressed in the right hemisphere in comparison to the left.  The parasagittal regions are relatively symmetric.
Features noted when the patient is unstimulated include bursts of FIRDA.  There is also some posterior delta noted.  Wakefulness is characterized by eye movement.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Discontinuous pattern.
An asymmetry with a more discontinuous pattern on the right.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
Sharply contoured activity in the posterior regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  No seizures were recorded.  If indicated, a follow-up study may be of use.
