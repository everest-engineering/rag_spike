History:	69 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. PMHX DEMENTIA, PARKINSON, CVA R 2007.
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS. 55 CM HEAD
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout
the recording and increases during drowsiness. No good A-P gradient is seen.  No sleep was seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 78
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
