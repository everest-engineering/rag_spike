CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old right-handed woman, status post ENT surgery, chronic tinnitus with intermittent paroxysmal vertigo, responsive to topiramate, and remote history of migraine.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate (none for many months), meclizine, diclofenac, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute routine outpatient digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had generally impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T2 electrode.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient has had previous bony resection on the left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Occasional shifting slowing is noted from the right or left temporal region.  Electrode artifact, compatible with a breach is noted on the left.
Brief stage 2 sleep included spindles and vertex waves.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background, it also accentuates the breach rhythm on the left.  Occasional bursts of shifting and slowing were noted in hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to shifting slowing seen from the right or left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding for the patient, who has had previous surgery.  The shifting slowing described above is a nonspecific finding and may be correlated with imaging.
