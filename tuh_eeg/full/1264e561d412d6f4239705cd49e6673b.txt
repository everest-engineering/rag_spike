History:	46 year old woman with reported daily seizures
Medications:	Depakote, vistaril, abilify, klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is noted.  The AP gradient is weak.  Excess
diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  Diffuse excess beta
activity is observed.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 20-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  The lack
of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
