History:	42 YO FEMALE WITH A HX OF SZ FOR THE PAST YEAR. LAST SZ WAS LAST
WEEK. AURA- SMELLS GAS, THEN FEELS FUNNY. SOME EPISODES SHE HAS
A LOC, OTHERS SHE IS AWARE, + TONGUE BITE, - INCONT.

PMH: HTN, HEART MURMUR
Medications:	TEGRETOL, HTN MED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  During drowsiness and stage I sleep small sharp spikes are
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
BETS (benign epileptiform transients of sleep) or SSS (small sharp spikes)
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. BETS are known as a benign variant.
