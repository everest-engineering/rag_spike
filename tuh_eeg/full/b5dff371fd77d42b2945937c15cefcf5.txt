CLINICAL  HI STORY:  A 38-year-old male with new onset seizures 5 days ago, nocturnal, 2-minute seizure. Also, history of recurrent episodes of syncope last year.
MEDICATIONS: None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG is well organized with a 9.5 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta followed by rhythmic central theta and then brief vertex waves.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was transitioning to stage 2 sleep and produced minimal driving.
Heart rate: 60-78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be considered.
