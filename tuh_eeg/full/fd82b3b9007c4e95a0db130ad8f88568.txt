History:	20 YR OLD WOMAN PRESENTS WITH H/O ONSET ON 10/25/14 PT HAD
EPISODE OF NAUSEA/VOMITING AND DIZZINESS W/FALL ALONG WITH
SHAKING X 30 SEC. PT RECALL EVENT AND WAS ABLE TO TALK W/EVENT.
EEG TO R/O SYNCOPE VS SZ.
Medications:	No AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
was 60 with frequent PVC's
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
