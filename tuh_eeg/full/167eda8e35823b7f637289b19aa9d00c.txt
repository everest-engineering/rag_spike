CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old right handed female with new onset seizures in December 2009. Seizure in sleep in September.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta. There is a very subtle abnormality identified with occasional rhythmic frontal theta. Hyperventilation produces scant background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a small degree of driving.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle theta in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to the EEG performed December 21, 2009, this EEG is better organized. Epileptiform activity was not well defined. In the previous EEG, the left temporal findings were previously noted. If additional information is needed, a follow up study is suggested.
