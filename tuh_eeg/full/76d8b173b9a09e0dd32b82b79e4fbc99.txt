LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 21-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures, migraine, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are noted.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and does not result in significant changes in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 21-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
