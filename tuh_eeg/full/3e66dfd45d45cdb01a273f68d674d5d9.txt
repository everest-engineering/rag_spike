CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old female with an aneurysm repair, residual language
disturbance, and recurrent confusion. Past medical history is also significant for status
epilepticus in December 2009.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF REPORT: The activity from right hemisphere was well organized
with 10.5-Hz alpha rhythm. The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach
rhythm and mixture of alpha and theta frequency activity. Alpha rhythm was a little bit
slow on the left. There Is also some underlying delta. Photic stimulation has a
significant driving.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with underlying delta.
2. Slowing of the alpha andÂ·theta frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous studies, no epileptiform features
were observed today. The activity in the breach rhythm was sharply contoured.
