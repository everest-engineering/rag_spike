INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using the 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes, as well as anterior temporal electrodes. Awake and stage I sleep were recorded. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were also performed.
MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine, calcium and aspirin.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: None.
HISTORY: A 55-year-old, right-handed woman with a history of childhood epilepsy with last tonic-clonic seizure in July 19, 2010, who presents with complaint of having an aura occurring and staring spell.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The record presents with a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm at 9Hz with a 20 to 70 microvolt amplitude, which is symmetric to her eye opening. There is a small amount of frontal central beta seen at 15 to 25Hz and 10 to 15 microvolts amplitude. Sleep stage 1 is seen. Activation procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were normal. Heart rate of 60 beats per minute was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves were seen at F7 and T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and 20 to 75 microvolts amplitude seen frequently.
SEIZURES: None seen.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG awake and sleep due to focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of local cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
