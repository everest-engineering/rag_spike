CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed female with a history of heart disease and head injury as a baby that presents with new-onset seizures with loss of consciousness, last one in 08/2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine, Propranolol, Seroquel, Singulair, Ambien, Calcium
REASON FOR EEG:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded awake and asleep stage I.  Photic stimulation was performed.  No hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-developed posterior dominant rhythm in the 9-10 Hz frequency and 20-60 microvolt amplitude.  There is some increased frontocentral beta seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Photic stimulation presented no abnormal discharges.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Very frequent temporalis muscle artifact seen for the majority of the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal limited EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG due to temporalis muscle artifact reveals no abnormal discharges.  Please note that the focal slowing seen in the left frontal regions in the past was not clearly visualized today which is different from the EEG done on 07/29/2011.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
