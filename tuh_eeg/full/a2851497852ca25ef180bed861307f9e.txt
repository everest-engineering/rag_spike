CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old woman with head trauma complicated by right parietal intracerebral hemorrhage with possible underlying mass.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Labetalol, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somewhat somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a low voltage beta pattern intermittently disrupted by more rhythmic, higher amplitude delta activity. The delta has characteristics of FIRDA and is a bit more prominent on the right. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal with an increase in theta. By and large, this is a drowsy pattern with more of a theta pattern with arousal. A scant 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm can be obtained on rare occasion.
HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Hypersomnia
2. Excess slow background with prominent FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION; There is bilateral shifting slowing but not much of a strongly focal or lateralizing pattern. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered.
