CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old gentleman who presents with new onset seizure-like activity described as loss of consciousness and shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  There are intermittent bursts of left anterior and mid temporal slowing at F7/T3 in wakefulness and sleep consisting of 3.5-4 Hz frequency, 50-70 microvolt in amplitude mixed with 8 Hz sharply contoured activity lasting for 1-2 seconds.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  Heart rate was 60 to 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the left temporal slowing seen during wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of a structural abnormality in the left hemisphere or left temporal dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
