CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of migraines, cloudy vision, left body weakness and speech problems.  Approximately 2 to 3 weeks ago she had uncontrolled body tremors and stuttering.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Topamax, Tylenol No. 4, albuterol, Singulair, hydrochlorothiazide and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness symmetrical vertex waves and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  No stage II sleep is achieved.  Hyperventilation is performed with a fair to good effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 26-minute electroencephalogram.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not achieved.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
