CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed woman who had a syncopal episode at work with past history of a headache for 1 week. Hypertension and visual impairment, right sided numbness.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record without hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Stage II sleep includes abundant, vigorous vertex wave K complex with spindles and POSTs. Photic stimulation demonstrates harmonic and super harmonic driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be of use.
