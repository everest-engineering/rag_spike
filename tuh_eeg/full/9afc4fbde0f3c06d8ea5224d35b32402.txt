CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old man right handed with severe mental retardation, developmental delay, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Citalopram, Benztropine, Risperdal, Ritalin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly disorganized background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening and with normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation do not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized spike and waves with an anterior predominance at 2-2.5 Hz with an amplitude of  70-140 mV occurring in bursts lasting as long as 3 seconds with no clear clinical correlate occurring during them.  The remainder of them appear to be symmetric, although sometimes some seem to have a right or left asymmetry.
General slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow anterior predominant spike and wave.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The discharges seen are consistent with a generalized epilepsy sometimes seen with symptomatic generalized epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
