CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed male with congenital heart disease, right
middle cerebral artery infarct followed by epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine, Crestor, Folic Acid, Loperamide, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. Seizures are
described by sudden body jerking 3-5 times a day.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
slow with an alpha rhythm below 8.5 Hz. In wakefulness, there is occasional focal slowing from the right central temporal region which increases as the patient becomes drowsy. There are. also some right central temporal sharp waves. In addition, there are bursts of frontally predominant paroxysmal delta and some bursts of spike and wave activity which are clearly maximum in the left frontocentral region, but are present bilaterally. These are seen around the time of photic stimulation. They precede the photic stimulation. During photic stimulation, the patient's right anterior temporal sharp waves become a bit more well defined. In addition, during that section of the record there is more clear persistent disruption of faster frequency activity.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere at times continuous, at other times more intermittent.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.
4. Some generalized frontally predominant spike and wave activity which is actually maximum on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above suggest contributors to this patient's
epilepsy which are outside of the history of the stroke. This may be correlated with imaging and clinical history.
