HISTORY: A 51-year-old woman evaluated in 2010 with altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and recent possible seizures.  Previously evaluated for altered mental status, low blood sugar, and possible seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Cymbalta, Norvasc, gabapentin, Xanax, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was extremely tense and there was a great deal of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy there is a small amount of theta.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, but the patient was very tense and the EEG essentially obscured by muscle.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically, somewhat limited EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep due to:  Excess muscle.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in the record.  Scant stage II sleep with spindles was elicited.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up, more prolonged EEG, perhaps with extensive sleep or with the use of an anxiolytic to reduce the muscle might be of value.
A previous EEG was recorded on January 2012 while the patient was medically unwell.  That EEG demonstrated metabolic features, such as triphasic waves, but also right central parietal sharp waves.  Those findings were not seen today.
