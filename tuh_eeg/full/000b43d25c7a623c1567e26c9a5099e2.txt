LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 24-year-old man with a history of seizures since 10 months of age.  He has been seizure free since 2002.  Now he has burning sensation in his head that last approximately 20-30 seconds and occur once a month.  These episodes started approximately 1 year ago.  The patient has a history of tuberous sclerosis.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 to 10.5 Hertz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Additional diffuse polymorphic delta and theta activity, often occurring in burst over variable cerebral region is observed.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominate rhythm attenuates and beta activity becomes more pronounced. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in diffuse background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing. No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 24 minutes EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.   This finding indicates etiologic nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
