CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old left handed female with a history of brain meningioma resection in 2002, frontal meningioma resection in 2002, diabetes, and seizures, presents with complaints of seizures.  The last one occurred 2 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta which is slightly increased over the right hemisphere in the frontal region.  Activating procedures revealed no abnormal discharges which included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen in the right hemisphere, maximal at F4 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts with a breach over that region.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontal slowing.
Breach.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right frontal region, which is consistent with the known tumor surgery.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
