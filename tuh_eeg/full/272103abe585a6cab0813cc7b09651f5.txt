CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old female.
MEDICATIONS:  Ambien, Seroquel, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard, 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  It was a technically satisfactory study although there was a fair amount of artifact when the patient moves about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Abundant stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.  In the transition between wakefulness and sleep, the drowsy pattern includes generous theta.
At 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the 19th, there is some background theta noted in the temporal regions bilaterally, perhaps a bit more on the left in comparison to the right.  Of note, the patient was off camera and did not appear to be in bed asleep.
INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DETECTIONS:  None.
CLINICAL SEIZURES:  None.
BEHAVIORAL EVENTS:  None.
HEART RATE:  70 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This section of video EEG monitoring did not identify epileptiform discharges or clinical seizures.  There was 1 section of the record with some temporal theta of unclear clinical significance.
