CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with stroke, right arm spasms, intermittent numbness, intermittent spasms.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin, Naprosyn, Celexa, Mirapex, Abilify, Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Simvastatin, Mirtazapine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, 10.5 hertz symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. In drowsiness, there is the appearance of central theta which is essentially symmetric. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified in this EEG nor the EEG recorded January 2010. Of note, the shifting slowing previously identified is not outside of the limits of normal today which may be part of this patient's recovery from his stroke. If the arm spasms are felt to be seizure, outpatient EEG
monitoring capturing one of his spells may be useful.
