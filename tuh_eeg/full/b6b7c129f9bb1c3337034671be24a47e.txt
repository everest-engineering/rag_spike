History:	69 YO MALE W/ L AND R SIDE COILING
PRESENTED TO ED WITH NOSE BLEED.
Medications:	Versed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background was characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuated
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity was present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Versed was administered at 5:53 PM with subsequent diffuse slowing of
the background.  At 5:10 PM the first stent was employed. At 6:21 PM the next stent was employed.
There were no associated EEG changes.
No focal slowing was present.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 90-100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, No asymmetry during cerebral angiography and stent placement
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG during cerebral angiogram and stent placement. There was evidence of
diffuse slowing that may have been related to medication effect.
