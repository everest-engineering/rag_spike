AGE : 62 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY : 10/06/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min
EEG #: 15-1468
HISTORY:
62 y.o. female with a history of lung cancer, metastatic to brain (left parieto-occipital region, s/p craniotomy and gamma knife; with new right-sided metastases), presenting with seizures .
MEDICATIONS: ATIVAN (1 MG), KEPPRA , DILTIAZEM, TRAMADOL, VENTOLIN , PRAVASTATIN , LORATADINE, SYMBICORT, TRAMADOL, LORATADINE, PRAVASTATIN
SEDATION : Ativan as above TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and
included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous and asymmetric.
The right hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of theta with admixed delta.
The left hemisphere consists of a disorganized mixture of delta with admixed faster frequencies.
The background is reactive, but there is no definite posterior dominant rhythm.
Drowsiness and sleep are not captured. There is moderate generalized slowing.
There is continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing,
posterior quadrant predominant.
There is a left posterior quadrant breach rhythm.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
There are continuous 1.5 Hz polyspike and slow waves with embedded rhythmic delta waves (lateralized periodic discharges, fast + rhythmic, or LPD+FR) over the left posterior quadrant (P3/T5/0l max) .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal Awake only	routine EEG due to:
Moderate generalized slowing
There is continuous left hemispheric polymorphic slowing, posterior quadrant predominant
Left posterior quadrant breach rhythm
Continuous 1.5 Hz polyspike and slow waves with embedded rhythmic delta waves (lateralized periodic discharges, fast + rhythmic, or LPD+FR) over the left posterior quadrant (P3/T5/0l max)
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of highly epileptogenic discharges over the left posterior quadrant.	There is additionally left hemispheric (posterior quadrant-predominant) cerebral dysfunction superimposed on moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.	A breach rhythm is consistent with this patient' s known history of craniotomy.
