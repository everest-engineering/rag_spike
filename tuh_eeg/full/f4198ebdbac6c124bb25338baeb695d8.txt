TIME:  From 12/22/2012 from 8:00 a.m. until 12/23/2012 at 8:00 a.m.
LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old man with somewhat recent onset of episodes characterized by lightheadedness, followed by loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra off, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Percocet p.r.n., and nicotine patch.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  The patient was on continuous audio video EEG monitoring.  The patient was provided with an event button.  Nursing staff notes and medical house staff notes were reviewed.  Spike detection and seizure detection were activated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, slow wave sleep, and REM sleep are captured.
The patient was artificially sleep deprived until approximately 3:00 a.m. on 12/23/2012.  There is an electrode artifact early in the recording in multiple electrodes.  After approximately 1:00 p.m. there is a continuous Fp1 electrode artifact, and by the end of the recording electrode artifact is observed in several electrodes.  Electrode artifact may limit interpretation of the EEG during those periods.
FINDINGS:
No events.
Electrode artifact in various leads throughout the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal continuous 24-hour audio video EEG monitoring.  No events were captured.  There was electrode artifact in various leads throughout the recording that could limit interpretation of the EEG during those time periods.
