CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old male with past medical history of seizures secondary to subdural hematoma with left bur hole in 2009, admitted on November 18, 2010 for a change in mental status. CT showed recurrence of bleed. A ventricular shunt was placed and twitching of left arm was noted.

MEDICATIONS: Vancomycin, Keppra, Zosyn, Morphine, Labetalol, Protonix.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has prior frontal craniotomy on the right.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly disorganized and slow. There is a dynamic pattern. Some sections of the record include primarily delta frequency activity. Rhythmic theta is seen in the right hemisphere more often than the left. There is intermittent generalized attenuation. Occasional high amplitude right anterior temporal spikes are seen. There are also some posterior temporal sharp waves.

HR: 110 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Focal slowing more prominent on the left at this time.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to his EEG last week the background is improving. The right hemisphere is returning to more of a theta pattern with the left hemisphere continues to demonstrate a delta pattern.
