CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old right handed female with a history of rapidly progressive dementia and Parkinsonism who presented with change in mental status and spontaneous jerks.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Valium.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient remained awake and would move throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 4 Hz, which is not reactive to eye opening and closing.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts, which at times do appear to have a pseudoperiodic pattern but does not remain constant.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
