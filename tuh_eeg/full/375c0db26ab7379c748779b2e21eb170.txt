CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old male with epilepsy, seizure free for 3 years, but with recent recurrence of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 27-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes of 70 microvolts with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  There is a modest amount of background theta.  With maximally awake, the overall EEG is reasonably well organized.  There are posterior slow waves of youth.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and elicits bursts of high amplitude rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity some of which includes spike and wave activity.  The bursts are less than 3 seconds in duration.  Following hyperventilation, the patient is drowsy, yawning and as he does so again discrete bursts of spike and wave activity were noted.
Photic stimulation was performed, while the patient was transitioning into stage 2 sleep with beta spindles and vertex waves and K complexes.  Aside from this there is not a definitive slowed photic driving response.  Likely underlying spike and waves activity is noted in stage 2 sleep, dyshormia.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep due to:
Frontally predominant spike and wave activity accentuated by hyperventilation and drowsiness .
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to previous study April 13, 2013.  This EEG supports a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  Of note, this patient reported medications, carbamazepine is noted to accentuate this finding.
