Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN, ASA 81, VIT B-12, CALC 600 WITH VIT D-3

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  There is
excess 7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior and mid temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Rare focal spike-and-wave discharges are present in the
left temporal region.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, few, left temporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  intermittent
focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  frequent epileptiform discharges in the left temporal region.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region, and given the
clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy.
