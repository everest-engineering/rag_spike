History:	61 year old woman with change in mental status.
Medications:	Phenytoin, vancomycin, ativan, trileptal, baclofen
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta >theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Periods of discontinuity are noted.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Discontinuous background, intermittent
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right hemispheric, subtle paucity of faster frequencies
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG because of moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing
with subtle slowing over the right.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate to-severe- diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral
dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No electrographic seizures are present.
