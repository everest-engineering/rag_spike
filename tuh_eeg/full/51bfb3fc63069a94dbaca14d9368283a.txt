CLINICAL HISTORY: A 46-year-old male status post right ACOM aneurysm clip, right hemorrhage with edema, HIV, now residing in a nursing home with PEG, trach, and unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: Antibiotics, atorvastatin, Keppra, Atripla, others.
INTRODUCTION: digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Despite technical issues, this is a technically satisfactory routine outpatient EEG for an unresponsive patient
OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal The right hemisphere demonstrates continuous, high amplitude. slow delta with a breach rhythm. The left hemisphere demonstrates scant theta activity in the posterior regions. There is some reactivity with tactile stimulation.
The left hemisphere demonstrates some faster frequency activity.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
This Is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere, at times sharply contoured.
2. A markedly slow pattern on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features or seizures were recorded. This Is similar to information is needed, a follow-up In the clinic may be of value.
