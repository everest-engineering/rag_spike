AGE: 69 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/29/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1427
HISTORY:
a 69 y.o. Female with a history of DM, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism and seizures referred for routine EEG for altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS:
Lovenox, lisinopril, Dilantin, ASA
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a mildly disorganized symmetric mixture of alpha, theta and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present. There is occasional excess of delta frequencies in wakefulness.fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen. Sleep is not captured.
There is mild generalized slowing. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and drowsy	routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing
Suboptimal organization
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction
