CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed woman with new-onset tonic-clonic seizures and a past history of schizophrenia.

MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Gabapentin, Folate Acid, Vitamin B12

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is a posterior dominant rhythm at 7 Hz, 30 microvolts. In apparent wakefulness, there are intermittent bursts of irregular, bilateral delta. There are also sleep epochs with a handful of bursts of sleep morphologies including vertex waves or spindles. In relaxed wakefulness, there is also shifting arrhythmic delta activity. Vertex waves are noted in sleep. There are rare sharp waves which appears a couplet with one on the left and then one on the right, but these are independent events. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION : Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Bursts of paroxysmal delta.
4. Rare sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. There are rare sharp waves noted in the EEG and these are seen bilaterally. The features described above are nonspecific, but considerations may include focal mechanism for epilepsy. A diffuse disturbance of cerebral function and/or
toxic and metabolic encephalopathy may be considered.
