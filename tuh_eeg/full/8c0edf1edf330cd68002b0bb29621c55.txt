History:	63 YO FEMALE FOUND FACE DOWN BY HUSBAND UNRESPONSIVE. LEFT ARM
SHAKING WITH HEAD TURNED TO THE LEFT. EMS WITNESSED SZ, SZ ALSO
WITNESSED IN ED GTC.
2/7/14 FOLLOW UP ROUTINE, PT NOT WAKING
Medications:	HEPARIN, SENOKOT, INSULIN, DULCOLAX, ASA, PRAVASTATIN, PROTONIX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Left hemisphere focal slow maximal in the midtemporal region with associated attenuation of faster
frequencies.  Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the T3 region at a
rate of 1 Hz.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges
(PLEDs) in the left midtemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a highly potentially
epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the left midtemporal region. In addition there is
evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.   No
