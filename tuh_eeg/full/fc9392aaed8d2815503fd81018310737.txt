History:	57 YR MALE WITH CC RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS, NUMBNESS, SLURRED
SPEECH,  D/C OSH  ADM (HTN) PMHX: HTN, HEP C, DRUG ABUSE, MANDIBLE
FX, LEFT FRONTO PARIETAL ICH.
Medications:	KEPPRA, COREG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which is only seen on the
right.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the
midtemporal and frontal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is a loss of
faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  At times there is sharply contoured activity at F3.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Irregular HR with average of 90 bpm
and PVCs.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous hemispheric, Maximal midtemporal and frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal and frontal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal
structural lesion in this region and consistent with the known ICH.  No clinical or electrographic
