CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old right handed gentleman who presents with new onset complex partial seizure with secondary generalization.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lorazepam, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The recording is continuous and symmetrical.  Voltages are very low.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 10 to 12 Hz alpha that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient during maximal wakefulness.  Excess beta is present throughout the recording.  There are intrusions of bursts of theta and delta during wakefulness.  During sleep, vertex waves, POSTS, and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation does not produce significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation was not performed.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  Bradycardia with heart rate less than 60 is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
Intrusions of sleep architecture into wakefulness.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION  This is an abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to intrusions of sleep architecture into wakefulness.  This could be the result of an excessively drowsy/tired patient.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Sinus bradycardia is observed on a single EKG lead with a heart rate of less than 60.
