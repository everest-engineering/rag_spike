CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male with refractory seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Imipenem, Baclofen, Keppra, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake, in restraints, but he uses his left hand to scratch his face.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to demonstrate occipitally predominant periodic complexes at approximately 1/second. There is an asymmetry in these complexes, can appear from the left or right occipital regions at different rates. On some occasions the complex leads on the left before the right and others vice versa. They are relatively invariant and they have transitioned from PLEDS plus more of a simple periodic complex. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A relatively invariant occipital periodic complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG represents an improvement for this individual. He is more alert, moving about; and, in addition, the activity is no longer evolving.
