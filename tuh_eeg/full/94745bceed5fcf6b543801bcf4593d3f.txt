CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed female with refractory epilepsy after head trauma, now with daily seizures while on Tegretol and Keppra.  This is the fourth EEG.  In addition, long term video EEG monitoring had been recommended.  An attempt had been made to schedule that.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which on rare occasions is disrupted on the right compared to the left.  In addition, there is a breech rhythm noted on the right.  Although there is some eye movement artifact, hyperventilation seen to accentuate focal slowing in the right hemisphere with slowing of the faster frequency activity on the right relative to the left and also some underlying delta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right hemispheric focal slowing.
Disruption of the alpha rhythm and disruption of faster frequency activity.
Focal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter.  Epileptiform features have not been noted for this patient since 2007.   The breech rhythm is anticipated finding following craniotomy.
