LENGTH OF RECORDING:  The EEG length is nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 61-year-old woman with episodes of nausea and dizziness followed by numbness in extremities and sleepiness for hours.  These episodes have been occurring for the last 2 years.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include hydrochlorothiazide, Diovan and Elavil.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of theta captured over the right temporal regions.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Step photic stimulation results in significant occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No abnormal discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21-minute electroencephalogram.  Lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
