CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult male, presented on the 28th with right parietal extra-axial hematoma of 5 mm thickness, left frontal scalp swelling, and obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra, Ativan, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient was comatose and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern with brief bursts of mixed theta and alpha frequency activity followed by attenuation of 1-2 seconds.
Stimulation of the patient did not activate the record
No clinical seizures were noted.
Heart rate:  72
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
burst suppression pattern.
Non-reactive pattern
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The use of sedative hypnotic medications or a severe, diffuse CNS process can both contribute to this pattern.  If seizures are an important consideration, a longer EEG monitoring may be of value.
