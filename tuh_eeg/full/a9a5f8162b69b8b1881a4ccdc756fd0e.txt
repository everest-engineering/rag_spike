CLINICAL HISTORY:  75 year old woman who is vent dependent and trached postoperative day 21 of lung biopsy with a waxing and waning mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Heparin, Insulin, Cardizem, ASA, Prednisone, Ipratropium, Famotidine, Bactrim
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while poorly responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There was no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Triphasic waves seen at 0.5-1 Hz with anterior predominance seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:    None.
HR:     114 and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Triphasic waves.  Please note that sometimes there is some sharply contoured right temporal and right frontal components, but not clearly epileptiform.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please note that the finding of triphasics has a high correlation with metabolic encephalopathy possibly related to liver disease.
