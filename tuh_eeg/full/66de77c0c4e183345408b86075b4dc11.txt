History:	64 year old woman with a history of a renal transplant and seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, vancomycin, meropenem, fentanyl
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude theta<delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Subtle paucity of theta activity and attenuation is noted over the right posterior quadrant.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, right posterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right posterior
No electrographic seizures
Cardiac arrhythmia
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 29 minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing and
subtle focal slowing and attenuation over the right posterior quadrant. Diffuse slowing is indicative
of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal right
posterior quadrant slowing and attenuation indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural
in etiology (including a fluid collection between the brain and the skull (such as SDH)).  Of note,
similar finding could also be seen if  there is asymmetrical electrode placement or a salt bridge
(seen in cases when EEG placement is challenging).  An irregular heart rate is noted on a single
