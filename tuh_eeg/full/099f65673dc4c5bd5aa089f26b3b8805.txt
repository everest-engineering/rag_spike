EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  During the procedure, diffuse theta and
delta were seen due to sedation. At times a symmetric burst suppression pattern was seen and the
team was alerted. The left common carotid was clamped at 11:56 AM. The left internal carotid was
clamped at 11:57 AM.  There was no background change noted on the EEG. The carotid was
Summary of Findings:
