History:	76 year old man admitted with confusion.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms at higher amplitudes over
the left.  The background over the right consists of low amplitude well formed, modulated and
reactive 9.5 Hz alpha activity posteriorly with expected AP gradient.  The background over the left
consists of unstable polymorphic 8 Hz theta activity with poor AP gradient and primarily theta and
delta activity that is most prominent over the left frontotemporal region.  Patient remains awake
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
occasional premature QRS complexes.  Patient is poorly cooperative and agitated by the end of
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric, especially frontotemporally
No stage 2 sleep
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 24-minute EEG due to continuous moderate focal
slowing over the left hemisphere, especially over the Left frontotemporal region.  This finding is
indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
