CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old right handed woman with alcohol abuse, epilepsy, now with increasing seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Librium, Motrin, Thiamine, Zosyn, Heparin, Lopressor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically challenging EEG in a patient who had difficulty cooperating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a low voltage pattern with generous beta and a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Despite the technical limitations, there appears to be an asymmetry with a bit of underlying delta in the right hemisphere.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, again better represented on the left.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal delta in the left hemisphere with at times some rhythmic 3 to 4 Hz activity in the frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were noted, but consideration for a potentially structural or functional process on the right is appropriate.
