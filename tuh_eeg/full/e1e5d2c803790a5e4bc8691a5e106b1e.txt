MEDICATIONS: Zolpidem, Cetirizine, Oxcarbazepine, Simvastatin, Levothyroxine,
Amlodipine, Tricor, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9. 7 Hertz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, central beta. There is a small
amount of theta is noted as the patient becomes somewhat drowsy. Photic stimulation
elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. A small amount of background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a nonspecific pattern. The small amount of
background theta is nonspecific and may be associated with medication effect.
