CLINICAL HISTORY:   50 year old female in for follow-up EEG. Patient has history of "an aura" of responsiveness lasting 2-3 minutes occurring 4-6 times per day, none at present. Low grade glioma diagnosed in 1999.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Lisinopril, Haldol, Metformin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness  there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation
is performed early on in the record and accentuates some left temporal focal slowing
with rhythmic theta, some of which is sharply contoured. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and a bit more left temporal focal slowing with isolated theta/delta.   Rare focal slowing is also observed on the right.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 	66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Left temporal focal slowing, some of which is sharply contoured.
2. 	Rare right temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, no epileptiform features were noted today.
