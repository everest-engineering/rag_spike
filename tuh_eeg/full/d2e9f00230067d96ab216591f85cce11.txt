MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  During this 24-hour section, the patient reported no seizures, no auras and no other symptoms.  He was relatively restless and had difficulty keeping his electrodes in place.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz symmetric reactive background.  Wicket activity was noted, as were lateral rectus (eye movements) spikes.  Sleep was relatively fragmented.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour section of EEG was remarkable for:
No seizures.
No interictal epileptiform discharges.
Prominent wicket.
This patient demonstrates multiple normal variants including wicket as well as some paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.  Of note, this patient seemed to have slept poorly during this section of the EEG.
Correlation with this patient's additional EEG monitoring and clinical history may be of value.
