CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed male with a traumatic brain injury December
2008, subsequently developing epilepsy, last seizure 2 weeks ago. Bilateral frontal skull
defects.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. There is a scant amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Stage II sleep includes
some slightly irregular vertex and spindle activity, congruent with the patient's previous
craniotomy. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Following photic stimulation as the patient becomes drowsy there is a prominent increase in beta.
Hyperventilation accentuates some of the frontal theta.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess frontal theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The craniotomy findings such as the breech rhythm are normal
finding after craniotomy. There is a small amount of excess theta. Overall, this EEG is
improved compared to a previous study dated 6/24/2009. Neither study demonstrated
epileptiform activity. In this individual with continued seizures, a more prolonged study
capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
