CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old right handed male with anxiety and an episode of altered behavior after using laced marijuana, now with fluctuating episodes of hallucinating, anxiety, agitation. The patient has been out of school since February because of these symptoms. Two possible concussions with loss of consciousness while playing football.
MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Abilify, Doxycycline.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with posterior slow waves of youth. In relaxed wakefulness, there is a scant amount of background beta. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in theta. Hyperventilation produces a small degree of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving response bilaterally.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for scant background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The theta described above is nonspecific and may be associated with this patient's medications. No epileptiform features were identified in
this awake and drowsy record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing sleep is suggested.
