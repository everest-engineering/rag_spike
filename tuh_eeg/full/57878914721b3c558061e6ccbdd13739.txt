History:	58 year old man with a history of lymphoma and increase in seizure frequency.
Medications:	KEPPRA, DEPAKOTE, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from ~8 AM on 12/18/2013 till ~ 8AM on
12/19/2013.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw
EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes
in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending
neurologist.  The Gotman spike and seizure detection algorithm (Stellate) was used to screen the
EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta
and delta activity, periods of discontinuity and diffuse spindle-like waveforms.  By the end of the
recording there is increase in diffuse EMG artifact.  This corresponds to initiation of phenobarbital.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Sinus tachycardia with heart ate up to 120 bpm is noted on a single EKG lead by the end of the
recording epoch.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous 24-hour video EEG due to moderate diffuse background slowing.
Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific but in this patient at least partially is related to the medication effect.  No
electrographic seizures are present.  The results were conveyed to the primary team.
