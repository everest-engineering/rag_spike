MEDS.PMHX SIG FOR CKD, HTN, ANEMIA, DM, HLD,
Medications:	heparin, insulin, lopressor, lasix, protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. There is a slight voltage asymmetry with some attenuation over the left hemisphere.
There are intermittent bursts of beta activity seen frontally and mainly on the right hemisphere.
Intermittently, there is diffuse attenuation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.  There was a clinical episode of mouth chewing with no clear EEG correlate.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Asymmetry, beta
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  left hemisphere attenuation which could be indicative of
cortical dysfunction in that region. In addition, there is  diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
