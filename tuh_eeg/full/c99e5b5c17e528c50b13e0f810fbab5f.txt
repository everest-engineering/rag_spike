History:	65 year old female with TBI and prior seizures.
Medications:	Midazolam, phenytoin, levetiracetam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present although rare alpha frequency activity was seen at times.
Background activity was characterized by diffuse medium voltage delta and theta activity with
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral generalized
Beta, excessive, bilateral frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Excessive beta activity may be a medication side effect.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
present.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
