DATE OF THE RECORDING:  01/30/2013 from approximately 8:00 a.m. until 01/31/2013 until approximately 8:00 a.m., total number of hours recording was 24.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with a history of episodes concerning for seizures since 2011.  These episodes are characterized by the sensation of a metallic taste in her mouth followed by loss of consciousness and generalized shaking.  These events can last up to 1 hour.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Depakote 250 mg on 01/30/2013 a.m. and then off, and clonazepam 2 mg b.i.d. and 2 mg b.i.d. as needed.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Spike detection and seizure detection were activated.  EEG was reviewed at least once during the 24 hour period.  The patient was provided with a push button.  Medical house officer's notes and nursing notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 to 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. Intrusions of brief bursts of diffuse theta and delta activity are observed during wakefulness. Similar activity is observed during patients sleep. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is captured.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, slow wave sleep and several epochs of REM sleep are captured. Sleep is very fragmented.  No typical events were captured. There were no push button events.
FINDINGS:
No events.
Intrusions of drowsiness into sleep
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 24 hour continuous video-audio EEG monitoring.  No typical events were captured. Intrusions of drowsiness into sleep are consistent with patientâ€™s history of chronic insomnia.
