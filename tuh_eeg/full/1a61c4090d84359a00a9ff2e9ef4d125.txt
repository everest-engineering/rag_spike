History:	This 40 2/7 weeks baby boy was born via SVD on 5/26/14. The nurse and
pediatrician caring for the infant noted rhythmic activity of right arm twice during
the day lasting less than 10 seconds. The infant was transferred to the ICN for further
Medications:	NO AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, neonatal
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
During active sleep, the EEG showed continuous low amplitude mixed frequency activity of 5-7 Hz
ad-mixed with 3-5 Hz activity of low amplitude.  Occasional delta brushes were seen bilaterally.
Infrequent right and left temporal and central sharp waves were seen.  During wakefulness, the EEG
showed continuous low amplitude mixed frequency activity of 5-7 Hz admixed with 3-5 Hz activity
of moderate amplitude.
The abnormal discharge began as a run of rhythmic sharp wave or slow wave recorded from the
right central area (C4) with no evolution or significant spread lasting for about 30-40 seconds (
recording was paused to feed the baby ).
Photic stimulation was not performed.  The EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm.
Summary of Findings:
, Electrographic seizure
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of an electrographic seizure discharge in the right central
area.  These finding could be indicative of a potentially epileptogenic area of focal cerebral
dysfunction in this region. Clinical correlation and further evaluation are recommended.  These
findings were conveyed to the primary team
