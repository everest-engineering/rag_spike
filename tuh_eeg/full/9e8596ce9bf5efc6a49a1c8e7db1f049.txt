CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old woman, status post MI and cath The patient had cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest at unknown date with myoclonic movements.  Past history of renal failure, on hemodialysis and diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone, norepinephrine, dobutamine, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were acceptable.  Muscle artifact and movement artifacts were noted in this bedside EEG for an intubated patient.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a continuous pattern, which in beta and theta frequency activity.  This is a technically difficult EEG for a patient with a great deal of muscle and movement artifact.  No sleep states were identified.  Stimulation of the patient produced eye fluttering and an increase in faster frequency.

Heart rate 90 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta, theta, and delta may be parts of this patient's diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were seen and then there were no strongly lateralizing features.  Although, the date of this patient's cardiac arrest is not known, at present this is a continuous at reactive EEG.
