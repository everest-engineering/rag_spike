History:	35 year old man status post cardiac arrest and hypoglycemia.
Medications:	VERSED, Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 04/23/2015 till 04/24/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation, the background voltages increase and a mixture
of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with underriding low amplitude fast
activity appears.  Periods of quiescence are characterized by large amount of low-to-moderate
amplitude fast activity admixed with bursts of theta-delta activity.  In the second half of the
recording, sleep spindles and vertex waves appear.  There is persistent subtle paucity of faster
No clear electrographic seizures are present.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate, continues to improve
Sleep spindles, present by the end of the recording
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~24 hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
continuous subtle focal right hemispheric slowing. There is focal cerebral dysfunction over the right,
possibly post-ictal in etiology since it continues to improve.  Diffuse slowing is a  nonspecific
indicator of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Presence of normal sleep architecture indicates
a favorable prognosis in terms of meaningful neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed
