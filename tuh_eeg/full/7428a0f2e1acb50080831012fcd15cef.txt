CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old right handed female with history of seizures with a slight increase during pregnancy.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with additional single channel EKG.  The patient was recorded during hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The patient did reach stage I sleep.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta is seen.  Activating procedures produces no abnormal discharges.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Frontally predominant spike and wave is seen at a frequency of 4.5 Hz with a slight asymmetry seen best over the left frontal region in small fragments appearing twice during the entire recording.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 2 small fragments of frontally predominant spike and wave, but a slight asymmetry over the left frontal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence consistent with a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The small fragments could be part of generalized epilepsy, however, the slight asymmetry towards the left frontal region suggests the possibility of focal epilepsy.  Repeat recording capturing deeper stages of sleep may confirm the diagnosis, however, the clinical history of previous medical illness suggests the possibility of generalized epilepsy.
