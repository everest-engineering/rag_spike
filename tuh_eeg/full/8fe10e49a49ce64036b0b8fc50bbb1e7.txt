INTRODUCTION: No typical seizures were recorded during this portion of the record.  There are some portions of the data, which cannot be retrieved from midnight until approximately 8:00 AM.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are a handful of push buttons for pain, as well as shifting in the bed. These are not for the patientâ€™s typical seizures.  This includes 16:27 in the afternoon. No epileptiform activity is associated with these symptoms.
The background continues to show focal slowing from the left temporal region with a mixture of theta and delta.  There are occasional sharp waves identified from the left temporal region.  In comparison to previous sections of the record, they are less prominent. There is a great deal of artifact identified in the awake record, but with the use of a filter there is some sharply contoured theta activity from the left temporal region, but without clear evolution and without evidence of any definite subclinical seizure. In stage II sleep there are vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles as well as POSTS. In comparison to the previous section of the record, there is not as much epileptiform activity in stage II sleep.
HR:  80 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal 48-hour video EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal regions, but with involvement to the central regions.
Sharp waves or sharply contoured activity identified from the left temporal region sometimes with some variability in terms of the phase reversal, but involving C3 on some occasions and with a anterior temporal localization on other occasions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: NOT MENTIONED.
