History:	33 year old woman who had a seizure several weeks ago.  Of note, patient had
seizures years ago while in school.
Medications:	Prozac, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Patient remains awake throughout
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 27-minute EEG. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
