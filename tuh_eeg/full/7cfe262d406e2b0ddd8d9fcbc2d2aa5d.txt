AGE: 38 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/29/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1430
HISTORY:
38 y.o. male with a history of seizures since 2009 (last 2013) referred for routine EEG for follow up.
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present . EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead .
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
