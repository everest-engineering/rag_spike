History:	40 YO FEMALE W / HISTORY OF SZ DISORDER AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION.

Medications:	PHENOBARBITAL, PHENYTOIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse 6-7 Hz theta activity in wakefulness.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, Slowing of PDR and excess theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Clinical
correlation is recommended.
