CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old with history of metastatic disease, adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis, hydrocephalus status post shunt, hypertension and parietal craniotomy, who presents with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Coreg, Protonix.
REASON FOR EEG:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was reported in wakefulness and lethargy. Stimulation was performed during the recording.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record with diffusely slow background where there is a lack of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere. Over the right hemisphere posterior dominant rhythm is seen at times which at best reaches 7 Hz and appears to be reactive to eye opening. No normal frontal central beta is seen over the left hemisphere. No sleep is recorded.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) seen at T3, at times with a more posterior field at T5 and more central field at C3 with a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz and an amplitude of 20-100 microvolts.
Focal slow waves seen in the left hemisphere, maximal at T3 with associated loss of faster frequencies over that hemisphere.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left mid temporal PLEDs with a large field over the left posterior quadrant.
Focal slow waves and lack of faster frequencies over that region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability over the left hemisphere, maximal in the left posterior quadrant and midtemporal region, which is consistent with a history of cancer and surgery in that region. No seizures were seen. There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.
