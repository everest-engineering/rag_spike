LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes, 35 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 45-year-old man who presents with right frontal intracranial hemorrhage and generalized tonic-clonic convulsion.  Past medical history is also notable for a stroke.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra; 2 mg of Ativan given in the emergency room.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9 Hz alpha activity that is unstable.  The anterior to posterior frequency gradient is weak.  Diffuse beta is observed.  Additional polymorphic diffuse theta and delta activity, as well as frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) are captured.  No normal sleep architecture is observed; however, periods of quiescence are noted.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, notably over the right lateral leads.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
FIRDA.
Paucity of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere, especially over the right temporal region.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing and right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right temporal region.  Diffuse slowing indicates neurologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal cerebral slowing is suggestive of underlying focal cerebral dysfunction.  Excess beta is secondary to medication effect such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines.  FIRDA could be seen in various encephalopathies, increased intracranial pressure, or deep white matter lesions.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does no preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
