REASON FOR STUDY:  Memory decline.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease and memory decline.
MEDICATIONS:  Razadyne, Lexapro, Lipitor, and Glucovance.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3, and independently at T3 occasionally at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal and mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal and mid temporal region, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
