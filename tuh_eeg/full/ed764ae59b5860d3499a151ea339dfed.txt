History:	60 yo male found down. GCS of 3 in ED. 2 Sz- Leg stiffening / arm flexed, eyes L
for several minutes 2-5 hours apart. pmhx: Hep C, Cabg, Aortic/Mitral valve
replacement. CTH- R frontal and L occipital infarcts
Medications:	Keppra, Versed, Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  During the record the patient
had stimulation induced facial and arm irregular jerking. The EEG showed a diffuse myogenic
artifact.  No EEG correlate could be seen with the discharges.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was  Technical difficulties: There is almost continuous muscle and
movement artifact seen in the entire record.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Attenuation, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The facial twitching had no EEG correlate and appears to be most consistent with
