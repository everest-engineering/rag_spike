CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old male, referred for seizure evaluation.  Patient was in the shower, had an episode of deja vu, followed by 1 hour of confusion.  The patient reports multiple episodes of deja vu since childhood, but was never found to have epilepsy.  Sister suffers with seizures.
Medications:  Unknown
INTRODUCTION:  A 26-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a technically acceptable record with most impedances under 5 kilohms.  In addition to hyperventilation and photic stimulation, the EEG captures stage 1 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 hertz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, which is accompanied by.  posterior slow waves of youth.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta and rare vertex waves.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this individual, who has a history of deja vu and a strong family history of epilepsy, consideration for a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
