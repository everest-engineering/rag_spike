DATES OF STUDY:  January 14 to January 15th.
TYPE STUDY:  This is a long-term EEG monitoring.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman with infrequent, but refractory seizures with serious seizure-related injuries.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient wore her CPAP mask during the later sections of the record.  The awake section of the record was remarkable for problematic muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there is a great deal of eye movement, but there is also a suggestion of left greater than right temporal focal slowing.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles.  REM sleep was likely identified at 4:47 with rapid eye movements in a patient who was otherwise asleep without significant muscle artifact.
In the transition in and out of sleep wicket activity was identified, but there were no definitive epileptiform features.
INTERIM IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This initial day of EEG monitoring was remarkable for shifting slowing in the transition in and out of sleep, but no definitive sharp waves and no spikes.
