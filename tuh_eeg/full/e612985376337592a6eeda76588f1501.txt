DATE OF STUDY:  November 21 through November 22, 2011.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
No clinical seizures were recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This section of the record is remarkable for intermittent bursts of sharply contoured activity in the left frontal and frontotemporal/centrotemporal region.  This typically occurs with a burst of delta, then fast activity and then underlying spike.  Most bursts are less than 10 seconds in duration.  There are sections of the record with bursts lasting up to 20 seconds.  There is also intermittent discontinuity.  At 7:00 p.m. is a section of the record with a bit more in the way of epileptiform activity.
At 11:22 there is an increase in muscle noted in the background.  Rather movements of the patient's upper extremities are noted.  There are certainly sections where she seems to be coughing on the vent.  This section of the record does include prominent epileptiform activity, but no definitive seizures, particularly on the morning of November 22.
By 2:11 in the afternoon, the EEG is better and the patient is actually moving a bit.  At that point the electrodes are discontinued briefly.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
