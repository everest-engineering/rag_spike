AGE: 28 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/04/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient EEG TYPE:	1 hour 95813
EEG #: 15-1304
HISTORY:
28 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for nocturnal seizures: GTCs.	Tongue biting BL.	Urinary incontinence . Diffuse myalgias
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg ER capsule, Take 3 capsules by mouth daily.
lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) 25 mg tablet, 1 tab QDX7days, 1 tab BIDX7days, 1 tab qam & 2tabs QHSX7days, 2tabs BIDx7 days, 3tabs BIDx7days, then start 100 mg BID
lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) 100 mg tablet, Take 1.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily. Take this dose after you complete the titration
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: TECHNIQUE:
1 hour	21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG , HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive low voltage 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Produced an increase in amplitude of the background
Photic Stimulation: was performed as patient transitioned to stage II sleep, elicited trivial driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
