History:	89 yo woman with new onset seizure 9/23/14. PMH: CVA, Rheumatoid arthritis.
Medications:	Keppra, Tylenol #3
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz beta activity is present, maximal
over bilateral fronto-central regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, beta
activity becomes more prominent, and symmetric vertex waves appear.
In wakefulness and drowsiness there is very minimal rare left temporal focal slowing.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
produces a minimal photic driving response.  HR 72 and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is a very mildly ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG for an adult of this age because of subtle
rare left temporal focal slowing. Focal features are not uncommon in an adult of this age, and can
be seen in cerebrovascular disease, consistent with history of prior stroke.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
