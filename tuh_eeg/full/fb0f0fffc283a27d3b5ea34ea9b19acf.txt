Medications:	LISINOPRIL, CARVEDILOL, SIMVASTATIN, METHADONE, RANITIDINE.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a poorly-formed 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Intermittent diffuse rhythmic 3 -4 Hz delta activity is present during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 85.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
