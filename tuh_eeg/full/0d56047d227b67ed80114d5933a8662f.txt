History:	DIFFICULTY W/ MEMORY IN THE SETTING OF LEFT FRONTAL STROKE
Medications:	ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic delta and theta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG
does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
