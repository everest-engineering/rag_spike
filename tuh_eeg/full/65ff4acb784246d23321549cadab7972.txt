CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed woman with a history of a stroke about 3 weeks ago who presents with right upper extremity weakness, pre-op for left carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Iron, Neurontin, Baclofen, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Lipitor, ASA
REASON FOR STUDY:  Left CEA.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz.  The patient has some lack of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 frequently and at times at F8/T4.
Generalized slowing of 5-7 Hz seen in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left more than right anterior temporal slowing.
Mild generalized theta slowing in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction in addition to left more than right anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
