History:	61 Y/O MAN IN FOR A BENIGN NEOPLASM OF  PITUITARY. S/P SURGERY
Medications:	DILANTIN,SODIUM,DEXAMETHASONE,LOVENOX,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz
activity.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During
stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep
Continuous attenuation is present in the right frontotemporal region.  Intermittent polymorphic delta
activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, right frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous attenuation in the
right frontotemporal  region.  This finding is indicative of a focal cortical structural lesion in this
region. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal  region.  This finding
is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Lastly, there is
moderate  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
