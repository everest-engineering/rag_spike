CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old right handed female with 10 year history of epilepsy, last seizure June 2010, described as generalized shaking for 5-10 minutes. Past history of cirrhosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Depakote, Celexa, Spironolactone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized. There is a 10 Hz, 30 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta as well as some rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is needed, a follow-up study is suggested.
