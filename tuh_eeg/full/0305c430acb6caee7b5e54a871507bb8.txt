CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 59-year-old woman with basilar artery aneurysm treated with coils with a history of a motor vehicle accident, alcohol use, and intermittent spells in which she loses her train of thought as well as chronic word finding difficulties.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient reports no clinical events. The seizure spike detection is used as well and this does not identify epileptiform activity.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal 24-hour video EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal study does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  A repeat study capturing the patientâ€™s typical events would be useful.
