CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed male with previous episode of loss of consciousness with incontinence, history of epilepsy, TB, adrenal insufficiency, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Previous EEGs were not available at this time.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the overall background is somewhat slow with primarily a theta frequency background.  With maximal stimuli, the alpha rhythm reaches 7 Hz.  The patient quickly drops off to sleep with shifting slowing.  There are a handful of bursts of frontal delta. Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation does to significantly activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wake and drowsiness due to:
Background disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG supports a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.
