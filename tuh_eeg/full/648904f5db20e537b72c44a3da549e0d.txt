MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Acyclovir, Protonix, Lorazepam, Ciprofloxacin, Dexamethasone, Bactrim
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 to 8.5 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Mild abnormal posterior dominant rhythm 8to 8.5 Hz for age.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
