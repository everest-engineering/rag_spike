INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  It was a technically acceptable 20 minute EEG, although T1-T2 electrode impedances were not ideal.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  There is generous beta noted diffusely.  There is subtle focality with intermittent focal slowing noted in the left hemisphere, particularly frontocentral.  There were also some bursts of shifting slowing noted.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  The beta activity becomes a bit more prominent.  There is some sharply contoured slowing noted in the left frontocentral region, and some of this is nearly isoelectric at F7.  Others includes some very low voltage, sharply contoured slowing at F3.
As the patient began to drift off to sleep, snore artifact awoke the patient but as he did so, focal slowing in the left hemisphere  was more prominent.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving, but more underlying focal slowing which was almost periodic was noted in the left frontal region during 15 Hz stimulation.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 20 minute EEG was remarkable for:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere, particularly the frontocentral and frontotemporal regions.
Subtle underlying sharply contoured slowing or subtle sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a March 26, 2013 EEG.  Epileptiform activity today is subtle but it is clearly present and supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. Additional clinical correlation for this individual, with prolonged spells without loss of consciousness, is suggested.
