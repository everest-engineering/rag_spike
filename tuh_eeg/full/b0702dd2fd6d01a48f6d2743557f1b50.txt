History:	37 year old man who presented after a generalized convulsion.  Patient currently
has fever.
Medications:	none listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, drowsy,
lethargic
Description:
During maximal arousal, waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm,
which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During prolonged drowsiness, the posterior dominant
rhythm attenuates and background voltages attenuate diffusely.  Patient rapidly transitions
between wakefulness and drowsiness.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is prominent sweat artifact.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Artifact, other, sweat
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute portable EEG, awake and mostly drowsy.  Patient transitions rapidly
between wakefulness and sleep - this pattern suggests that the patient is excessively drowsy. The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
