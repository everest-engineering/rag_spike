CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old left handed male with oligodendroglioma, VP shunt, transferred back from the Rehabilitation Service for episodes of arm spasm.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Keppra, Zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is described as having a craniotomy on the left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  April 21 to April 22:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern rich in fast activity.  This is accompanied by bursts of theta frequency activity.  There is a discrete sharp wave noted occasionally at F7/FP1.
The overnight review of the first 24 hours of data demonstrates essentially an anesthetic appearing pattern with bursts of faster frequency activity and intermittent attenuation.  There are subtle frontal sharp waves observed.  The activity waxes and wanes.
On the morning of Sunday, April 22, the patient was described as having an episode of arm twitching following suction.  Review of the data fails to identify this episode.
April 22 to April 23:  Continuous video EEG monitoring continues.  There is no mention in the record of a change in the patient's medicines.  The activity is more continuous.  The focal slowing is a bit more prominent when the record is continuous.
No epileptiform seizures were identified.
HR:    120 to 140 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
What appears to be an anesthetic pattern with generous beta and alpha frequency activity with intermittent attenuation.
Intermittent focal slowing.
Subtle sharp waves from the left with accentuation of fast activity on the left, compatible with a breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Additional EEG monitoring may be considered if the patient has recurrent spells.
