CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with generalized tonic clonic seizures associated with loss of consciousness followed by
confusion. He was found down on the stairs. He has a past history of right frontal trauma.
MEDICATIONS:
Risperidone and Dilaudid.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
This is an awake and drowsy record. In wakefulness, there is 9-10Hz posterior dominant rhythm bilaterally. The patient is
very drowsy and goes in and out of sleep during the recording. Drowsiness is characterized by generalized slowing. Stage
1 sleep is characterized by the presence of vertex waves. There were no epileptiform features noted. Hyperventilation did
not activate the record and there is no driving seen on photic stimulation.
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG in wakefulness to stage 2 sleep. No epileptiform features.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a clinical consideration, please consider
sleep-deprived study or a longer EEG recording to capture epileptiform activity.
