History:	67-YEAR-OLD WOMAN FOR CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM
RE-STENOSIS AFTER LEFT CEA  FOR POSSIBLE STENTING
PMH: LEFT HEMISPHERIC STROKE
Medications:	FENTANYL, PROPOFOL, VERAPAMIL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  There is diffuse slowing of the background with intermixed alpha
and excess theta and intermittent periods of diffuse attenuation.  No normal sleep architecture is
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left parieto central region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  At 10:15 AM the stent was deployed.
There was no associated EEG changes.  HR is 80-100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left parietal, left parieto central
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Attenuation diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG during cerebral angiogram with stent placement for restenosis of left
carotid artery.  There is diffuse background slowing which may have been related to anesthetic
medications. The findings are conveyed to the primary team during the procedure.  There was
intermittent left parieto central focal slowing at the baseline. This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
