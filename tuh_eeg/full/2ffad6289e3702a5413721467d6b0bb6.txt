CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old woman with recent subdural hematoma, as well as C1, C7, T1, and T2 fractures, now transferred from Episcopal due to left facial droop, increasing left sided weakness, ptosis, atrial fibrillation, and right ACA infarct, but subdural hematoma is described as stable.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Zocor, Protonix, Metoprolol, Morphine, Enalapril.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient wearing a hard collar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow with excess 4 Hz activity in the background and 8 to 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. In addition, the activity seems to be a little bit more attenuated on the left compared to the right. There is some shifting slowing and there are some sections where it seems to be more attenuated, left temporal and right central. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, which is more vigorous on the left compared to the right.
HR: 70 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
3. Prominent shifting slowing with intermittent attenuation of faster frequency from either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric process which may have involved each hemisphere in a unique manner. No epileptiform features were observed.
