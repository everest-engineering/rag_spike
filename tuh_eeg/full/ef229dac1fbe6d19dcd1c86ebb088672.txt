History:	45 YO FEMALE BUMPED HEAD PREVIOUS MONDAY, FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER
OF EVENTS INVOLVING FORGETFULNESS AND CONFUSION DURING THE
WEEK. HUSBAND FOUND PT FRIDAY MORNING WITH HEAD IN HANDS
SCREAMING AND VOMITING, PT DOES NOT RECALL ANY OF DESCRIBED
Medications:	TYLENOL, AND NAUSEA MED?
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was observed.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  There
where frequent frontal slow discharges seen intermittently the morphology of which appeared to be
due to eye movement rather than focal slowing.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  There was an intermittent frontal rhythmic theta/delta discharges with a field and
morphology most consistent with eye movement artifact. If necessary a repeat EEG with eye
electrodes and prolonged sleep would help confirm the artifact.
