History:	77 year old woman with change in mental status and poorly defined tremors.
Patient is status post several brain surgeries, including right sub-occipital
craniectomy for right cerebellar hemorrhage.
Medications:	MORPHINE, VECURONIUM, VANCOMYCIN, NOREPINEPHRINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording, large amount of EMG artifact, especially
over the left temporal region is seen.  Patient received vecuronium and EMG artifact resolves.
Subsequently, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with
occasional diffuse sleep spindle-like waveforms.  Subtle polymorphic delta activity is noted over the
No electrographic seizures are captured.  No events of tremors are noted.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing and subtle severe
right anterior temporal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  No electrographic seizures or events of tremors captured.  If
there is ongoing concern for seizures, patient may benefit from continuous EEG monitoring.
