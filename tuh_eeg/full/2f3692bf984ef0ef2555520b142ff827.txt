History:	80 YEAR OLD  RIGHT HANDED FEMALE WITH INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE
AND HERNIATION. EVALUATION FOR BRAIN DEATH.
Medications:	PLAVIX, PRILOSEC, COUMADIN, PROTONIX, SYNTHROID, BUMEX, INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm is present.  There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the
recording.  This EEG was performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical
Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory,
tactile, or noxious stimuli.  All electrodes were checked for integrity.  HR 79  Intermittent EMG and
O1 noncerebral and nonphysiologic artifacts were seen.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because this is an isoelectric EEG performed according the the ACNS
guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  This EEG is consistent with, but not
diagnostic of, cerebral death.
