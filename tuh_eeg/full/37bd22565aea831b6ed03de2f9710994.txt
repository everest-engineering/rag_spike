History:	41 year old man who presents after 2 generalized convulsions, now with persistently
poor mental status.
Medications:	Dilantin, keppra,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
During brief arousals the background consists of moderate amplitude relatively monomorphic 8-9
Hz activity.  Patient is asleep throughout most of the recording epoch.  Periods of quiescence are
characterized by low amplitude delta activity, admixed with underriding fast activity and sleep
Multifocal independent focal and generalized sharp waves and spikes are captured.  Sharp waves
are captured over the left frontocentral region, right frontocentral, predominantly left occipital and
Summary of Findings:
Spikes multifocal
No electrographic seizures
Beta, excessive
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous 4 hour video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
multifocal epileptiform discharges. Diffuse background slowing indicates diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, that is etiologically non-specific, but, given how somnolent the patient is, is at least
partially related to excessive drowsiness.  Epileptogenic potential is present in multiple cerebral
regions.  No electrographic seizures are present.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
