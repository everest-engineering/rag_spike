History:	60 year old female presenting with an episode concerning for a seizure.
Medications:	metformin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude fast alpha rhythm (~18 Hz), which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is seen.
Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-
7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  EKG artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Alpha variant, fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21 minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
