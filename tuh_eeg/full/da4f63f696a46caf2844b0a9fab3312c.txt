CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old male with Dandy-Walker syndrome, cerebral palsy, and multiple shunts.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Although, there were multiple craniotomy defects, the patient was reasonably cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a pattern of diffuse beta with prominent 9-10 Hz activity noted in the right frontal region, one of the noted craniotomy defects. Prominent eye movement artifact was seen.  The drowsy pattern is similar to the awake pattern with generous beta.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record. Heart rate: 132 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for;
Absence of the normal awake morphologies for an adult of this age.
Diffuse generalized beta pattern.
Paroxysmal rhythmic right frontal alpha frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs for comparison. This EEG supports a bihemispheric diffuse process.  The frontal alpha activity may be an epileptiform signature.
