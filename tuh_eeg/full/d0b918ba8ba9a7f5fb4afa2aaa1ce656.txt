DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation produces minimal rhythmic theta.  Photic stimulation was performed, although patient was asleep and elicited a scant driving.
Heart rate 55 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG clinical correlation:  This is a follow up EEG, which did not identify epileptiform activity.  If seizures are an important consideration, additional recording techniques may be utilized.
