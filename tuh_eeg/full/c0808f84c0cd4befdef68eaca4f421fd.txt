CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old gentleman with epilepsy, recent evacuation of right
subdural hematoma. Received other seizure medications during his recent hospitalization.

MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Phenytoin, Tylenol, Phenytoin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20   system of electrode placement with 1channelEKG. Photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is a 7.5 Hertz alpha rhythm. The activity is slightly lower amplitude on the left  There is a subtle T1sharp wave noted on the left and there is shifting arrhythmic delta activity. The patient's craniotomy was on the right, supporting the
higher amplitude activity on the right. Photic stimulation elicits no driving response.
HR:   60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Modest background slowing and disorganization.
2. A slight amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right.
3. A single left temporal sharp wave.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Only a single left temporal sharp wave was not considered  to be definitively epileptogenic as it may represent artifact  The bi-hemispheric features may be correlated with images.
