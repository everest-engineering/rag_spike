CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old male status post Ml, status post treatment with hypothermia, now edematous , intubated, and comatose.

MEDICATIONS: Phenylephrine, Eptifibatide, Demerol, Depakote, Midazolam, ASA, Plavix, Zocor, Potassium, Insulin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous, but very slow, featureless pattern. Superimposed upon this is a posteriorly predominant periodic complex, which shows little variability. The complex is seen bilaterally in the occipital region, but is clearly maximum on the left. Tactile stimulation does not modify the discharge. Use of an average reference demonstrates a phase reversal in the central parietal region. There are
occasional  attenuations noted in the record. During the record, the patient receives IV valproate. This prolonged 2.5 hour record demonstrates  no significant changes in the background with tactile stimulation. Briefly, during the recording, the PLEDs appear to attenuate a bit, although this cannot be entirely correlated to the Depakote.   Facial grimacing is observed, but does not correlate with an EEG signature.

HR:	122 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a relatively monomorphic slow, and almost discontinuous pattern.
2. Left occipital PLEDs.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying encephalopathy. These findings were discussed with the clinical team and the family at the bedside.
