CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed female with left sided weakness, numbness and syncopal spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm. There is shifting temporal slowing, more so on the left than the right. Hyperventilation accentuates the left temporal focal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Minimal drowsiness is characterized by decrease in eye movement. Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting temporal slowing primarily on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen. These EEG findings may be correlated with imaging.
