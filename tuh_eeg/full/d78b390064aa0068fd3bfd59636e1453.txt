LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a reported history of epilepsy who now presents with recurrent episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness, hot flashes associated with some disorientation.  She had several such episodes today.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Tegretol.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Throughout the majority of the recording the patient is either drowsy or asleep.  Sleep architecture is characterized by increase in the amount of diffuse theta, vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes.  No clear focal slowing is appreciated.   Hyperventilation results in mild symmetrical slowing of the background as well as symmetrical rhythmic bursts of diffuse delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Sleep stage 2.
2,  Very briefly awake.
No clear focal slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal, briefly awake, mostly drowsy and sleep 23-minute EEG.  These findings are consistent with excessively drowsy patient.  The results of the recording were conveyed to the Neurology consult team at the time of the dictation.
