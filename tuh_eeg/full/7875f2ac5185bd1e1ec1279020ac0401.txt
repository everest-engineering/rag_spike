History:	19 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O ONSET OF SZ AT AGE 3, NOW WITH
BREAKTHROUGH SZ ON 1/1/14 DURING SLEEP, W/ TONGUE BITING.
Medications:	none
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and Ekg
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  At times the background is somewhat disorganized and reveals excessive
theta in wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior temporal (T6) region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is also present in
the left temporal (T3) region independently during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, frequent, mild diffuse, (excess theta in wakefulness)
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, right temporal, posterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because it reveals evidence of focal cerebral
dysfunction independently in the right posterior temporal region and left midtemporal region in
addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,  all of which are non-specific with regards to etiology.
No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
