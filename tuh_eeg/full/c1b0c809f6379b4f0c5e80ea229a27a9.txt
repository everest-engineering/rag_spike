CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old mother of 2, recent delivery of an infant, now with episodes since age 6 described as panic, scream, no loss of consciousness. These spells recurred after pregnancy and birth of daughter 1 month ago, now with generalized tonic/clonic seizures and loss of consciousness. Medication nonadherence. The patient is failing to make her neurology clinic appointments.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11-Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta followed by vertex waves. The patient seems to be somewhat drowsy, transitioning in between wakefulness and stage I sleep. Hyperventilation produces a vigorous hyperventilation response with rhythmic theta. After this, the patient transitions to stage II sleep with vertex waves, Kcomplexes, spindles, and posts. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep but does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of panic or epilepsy.
