History:	37 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O AFTER FALLING DOWN STAIRS AND
WITNESSED GEN SHAKING FOR UNKNOWN DURATION, PT HAS NO RECALL OF
EVENT. REPORTS HX OF SZ X 1 MONTH AGO 2/2 TO ETOH WITHDRAWAL.
Medications:	POTASSIUM, MORPHINE, LORAZEPAM, PROTONIX, OCTREOTIDE, TYLENOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse
increase in amplitude of the background.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Other, mild slowing of posterior dominant rhythm
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to mild slowing of the posterior dominant
rhythm. This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction
and may be attributable to medication side effects, metabolic encephalopathy or a post-ictal state.
