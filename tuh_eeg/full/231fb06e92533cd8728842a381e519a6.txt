CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 32-year-old woman with a 10-year history of infrequent seizures, but three in the last 5 months with loss of consciousness.  The patient reports that it takes her days to return to baseline cognitive ability, so an outpatient EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontal central beta activity and scan background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta, particularly in the central regions.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces bursts of paroxysmal higher amplitude theta activity with slight shift in asymmetry noted in hyperventilation, there are some bursts which are slightly asynchronous, and on two occasions, slightly higher amplitude on the left.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving response.
Heart rate: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is considered within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The hyperventilation pattern described above is classically considered within normal limits.  (Gibbs and Gibbs).  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  To more completely characterize this individual's epilepsy, consideration for a more prolonged tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep and/or a fasting study may be of value (this study was performed in the afternoon).
