DATE OF STUDY:  August 4, 2011 through August 5, 2011
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old woman with an anxiety disorder and left arm shaking after a lymph node biopsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the long-term monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
No clinical seizures were noted by the team but the patient pushed the button frequently for feelings of nervousness and shakiness.  These were evaluated by the nursing staff and there were many pushbutton events for tremulousness including 11:51, 14:50, 02:44, and 08:20.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a normal awake pattern.  Drowsiness was characterized as increase in beta.  Posts and spindles are noted in Stage 2.
The EEG during each of her spells is characterized by muscle artifact.  When the patient is not shaking, the EEG is normal and the patient is pressing the pushbutton repetitively throughout the spells.  The minute she stops moving a normal awake pattern is noted with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This long-term video EEG monitoring with continuous seizure and spike detection was remarkable for four behavioral events with tremulousness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in association with these spells.
