CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with right facial numbness since teenage years.  Possible stroke 9 months ago with involvement of the right face and a seizure 1 week ago characterized by involuntary gibberish speech and loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Phenobarbital
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta and generous beta.  The first stages of sleep were not sustained.  A single twitch in sleep was not associated with epileptiform activity.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 72 bmp, rare PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if a additional information is needed, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
