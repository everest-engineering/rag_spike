CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old woman status post overdose with Wellbutrin approximately 12 hours prior to the EEG.  Subsequent tonic/clonic seizure at 4:30 am., 4 hours prior to this EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, Neo-Synephrine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes a delta pattern with eye movements.  Although the patient seems quite somnolent, posts are noted.
Spontaneous movements are noted and occasional isolated arm jerk is characterized by muscle artifacts.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG supports a significant, disturbance of cerebral function affecting both hemispheres.  Medications or post-ictal state may play a role in this pattern.
