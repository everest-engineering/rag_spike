CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old admitted on the 18th with an episode of left hand twitching and
then general zed tonic clonic seizures followed by postictal paralysis. Past history of aneurysm
clip March 20, 2011.
MEDICATIONS: m, Vancomycin, Keppra HCTZ, Metformin,
EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 of EKG. Hyperventilation and stimulation are
performed. This is a for an intubated patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE EEG
the patient is awake, there is abundant alpha and beta
frequency activity and a glimpse of an alpha rhythm with 9 Hz on the more so than the right
in this high amplitude record.
There is an asymmetry with more vigorous alpha frequency
activity on the left compared o the right and in this sharply contoured record, a subtle
underlying right temporal sharp wave. Beta activity is more prominent in the frontal regions and
has a more generous field in he left frontal region compared to the right. As the patient become
drowsy, there is a subtle asymmetry in posterior delta again a little bit ore so on the right than
the left.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal E G due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Background disorganization.
3. Subtle right temporal sharp waves.
4. Subtle focal features in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL This EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures. In addition, a
structural process involving gray and white matter on the right should be considered and this
may be correlated with imaging.
