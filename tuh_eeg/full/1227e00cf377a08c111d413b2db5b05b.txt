CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old right handed woman, with overdose of heroin, Xanax, Percocet, cocaine.  Patient required Narcan and Haldol in the emergency room and now has slurred speech.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone, heparin, potassium.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging record with problems with impedances, but it is a valid, interpretable study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates continuous stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.  Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The pattern of consistent stage 2 sleep is compatible with the use of sedative, hypnotic medications.
