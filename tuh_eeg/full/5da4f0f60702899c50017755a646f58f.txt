History:	68 YO MALE TRANSFER FROM OSH FOR ALTERED MENTAL STATUS.
PMFX: CKD, T2DM, HTN, OSA, GERD,HYPERTENSION
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reached at best 6Hz  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Intermittent diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic
morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to
posterior phase lag.  Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  Some state changes were
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84 with  frequent PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Triphasic waves
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing,  slow alpha rhythm, FIRDA
and intermittent  frontally-maximal triphasic waves.  These findings are indicative of a severe
diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
