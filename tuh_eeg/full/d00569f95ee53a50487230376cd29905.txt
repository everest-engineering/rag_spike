CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old male with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, bilateral subdural hematomas, admitted with UTI and briefly paralyzed.
MEDICATIONS:  Bisacodyl, Ativan, Valproic, Flagyl
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is observed to have an asymmetric cranium.  The EEG is recorded just after a focal seizure with motor activity on the right.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is marked abnormal with a mixed frequency background.  It seems to be at times more attenuated on the left than the right.  Throughout the EEG, intermittent sharp waves are picked up in the left hemisphere with a variable spread including left frontocentral.  Depakote is administered intravenously during the EEG around the time that the sharp waves start increasing. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.  There is waxing and waning of the overall background and there is an increase in beta in the later sections of the record.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly abnormal background.
Somewhat attenuated pattern on the left.
Left hemispheric or frontocentral sharp waves increasingly periodic at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were identified.  However, this remains a very irritative pattern.  These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
