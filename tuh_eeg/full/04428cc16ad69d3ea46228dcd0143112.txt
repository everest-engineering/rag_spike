CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old woman with bilateral strokes and respiratory insufficiency, aspiration risk.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, metoprolol, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  The patient was described as confused and not following commands.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with a low voltage pattern and an alpha rhythm ranging from 7 to 9 Hz.  Eye movement was noted.
There was significant muscle activity noted intermittently during the record.
Heart rate:  104 BPM.
Occasional snorting was observed.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal, but awake, EEG due to mild background swelling.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a history of bilateral stroke syndrome, this EEG is quite unremarkable.  Although the patient appears unresponsive, she is, in fact, awake.
