CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old male, status post right lung resection, past history of cirrhosis, dementia, colon cancer.  The patient was reported to have a tonic-clonic seizure July 28th, year unstated.  Patient readmitted to the hospital on June 5th following 2 tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable bedside record in a patient with limited cooperation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a relatively low voltage and somewhat slow pattern in the temporal regions with theta and occasional bursts of delta.  Although, there is no mention of a craniotomy, higher amplitude fast activity is noted in the central region with fast activity including both theta and beta.  Prominent bursts with shifting asymmetry and shifting arrhythmic delta were noted in the central regions.  Patient appears to be somewhat confused during the record, but towards the close of the record with stimulation, there was a suggestion of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
Heart rate 108 bmp.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background.
Shifting slowing.
Prominent arrhythmic delta activity in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  Correlation with imaging may be a value.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison at this time.
