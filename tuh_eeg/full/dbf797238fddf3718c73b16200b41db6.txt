CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old male with subdural hematoma; history of subsequent seizures, mostly involving left-sided shaking.  Pacemaker site record many other problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a 20-minute, technically satisfactory EEG capturing wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally.  An apparent breach rhythm is noted with an increase in amplitude on the left compared to the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy, subtle rhythmic slowing is noted in the left mid to anterior temporal region.  The breach rhythm is also slightly more prominent in sleep.
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
Heart rate 66 bpm irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to
subtle focal slowing from the left with at times left rhythmic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs are not available.  There were no epileptiform features were noted, and this EEG is overall well organized.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be a value.
