CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 19-year-old, right-handed woman with infantile cerebral tumor, epilepsy since age 3, seizure on May 9, 2014.
MEDICATIONS:  Dexmethylphenidate, Remeron, Benadryl, Vimpat, Depakote, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient had difficulty cooperating with the test and her caregiver had limited language competency.
This was a technically challenging record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm is identified on the right.  It is more difficult to identify on the left and the left has slower, 5 Hz activity in the occipital region.  Frequent eye blink artifact was noted in wakefulness.
Hyperventilation accentuates the asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres by increasing the amplitude of the alpha rhythm on the right with the absence of a well-defined alpha on the left.  Photic stimulation elicited in asymmetric driving response, better developed on the right in comparison to the left.
Drowsiness was achieved at the end of the EEG with an increase in theta bilaterally.
Frontal eye movement artifacts were noted, which were sharply contoured, but there were no definitive frontal sharp waves.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal features in the left hemisphere including disruption of the alpha rhythm and rhythmic theta within the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted, but this individual had difficulty getting comfortable.  A more prolonged record capturing sleep may be helpful in search of frontal sharp waves.
