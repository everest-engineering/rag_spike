CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old woman admitted on 2/7/2010, after anoxic injury with
complex epileptiform now intubated, comatose and no longer twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Acyclovir, Pantoprazole, Mycamine, Heparin, CEFEPIME, Norepinephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient Is Intubated and unresponsive.
Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a discontinuous
pattern with prominent of generalized polyspike and wave activity as well as spike and wave activity. In some locations a bit of a polyspike can be noted in the right frontocentral region but on the whole the activity is quite symmetrical. There are brief periods of attenuation or suppression lasting to 3 seconds. On occasion there is a little bit of focality as the activity resumes with some suggestion of a bit more theta on the right. In the frontotemporal regions, however, the activity is bit more prominent on the left. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Burst
2. Frontally predominant epileptiform activity in bursts and trains.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies. These findings now, 5 days post support a poor prognosis. EEG monitoring will follow this.
