Description:
Waking background is characterized by an intermittent 25-40uV, 7.5 -8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present intermittently, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness .  Intermittent diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording. These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  There is a high amplitude sharply countoured occipital discharge that does not
evolve or appear to be epileptogenic. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Patient was reported to have left shoulder jerking with no clear EEG correlate.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse Triphasic waves, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of Intermittent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and mild to moderate diffuse background slowing. These findings are indicative of a severe
diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
