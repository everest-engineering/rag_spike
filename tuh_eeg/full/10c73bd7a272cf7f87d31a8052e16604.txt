CLINICAL H STORY: A 26-year-old right-handed male, who had a seizure on August 10th,referred from an outside hospital (RMH). Diagnosed with complex partial or focal epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG. This was a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low voltage EEG with an 11Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase In background theta and POSTS. Stage 2 sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was transitioning into stage 2 sleep.
Total study duration: 20 minutes. Heart rate: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG In wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. If epilepsy is an important consideration     a more prolonged study should be considered.
