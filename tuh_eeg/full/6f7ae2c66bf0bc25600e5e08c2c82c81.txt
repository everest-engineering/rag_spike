Medications:	DEPAKOTE (DOESNÕT KNOW OTHERS)
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of beta activity with an increased amplitude
over the left consistent with a breach.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left central, with associated breach
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
left central region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region, which is
consistent with the known surgery.
