CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman with past history of epilepsy, seizure free for 18 months after she stopped her seizure medications.  Past history of meningioma 2003 and left skull defect.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, simvastatin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record eliciting subtle slowing from the left temporal region.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm, rhythmic central theta followed by beta.  Rare vertex waves are noted, but stage 1 sleep is not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very subtly abnormal EEG due to left temporal focal slowing with a slight asymmetry in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the fifth EEG for this patient.  She has had intermittently normal EEGs as well as EEGs with subtle left temporal theta and on 1 rare occasion in 2010 left temporal sharp waves in photic stimulation.  The findings today are congruent with a past history of meningioma resection in that region.
