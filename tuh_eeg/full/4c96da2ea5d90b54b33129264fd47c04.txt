CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old man with MS and recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and during lethargy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact and muscle artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontal central beta.  There was no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  The background is consistent of generalized slow waves at a delta frequency at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F3/C3 and sometimes at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.
At two points during the study there was a rhythmic run of A1 sharp waves that lasted 5-10 seconds with no clear evolution.  There was no video correlate or clinical correlate to this discharge.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal central and temporal sharp waves.
Two runs of sharp waves in the left temporal lobe
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left frontal central region and/or the mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region which has a high correlation with a structural lesion in that region.
