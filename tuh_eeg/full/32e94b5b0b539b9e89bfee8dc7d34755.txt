CLINICAL HISTORY: 	65 year old woman with sepsis and agitation.
MEDICATIONS: Lorazepam,  Plavix, Heparin, Nitroglycerin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a relatively symmetric, continuous pattern of mixed rhythmic theta and delta.  Stimulation of the patient does not produce much of an alerting response, but does increase some of the rhythmic data.
HR:	80-110 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Replacement of normal background with a pattern of rhythmic background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   These findings are nonspecific but can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The rhythmic slowing and the FIRDA can be seen in a toxic or metabolic process.  No focal nor epileptiform features were identified.
