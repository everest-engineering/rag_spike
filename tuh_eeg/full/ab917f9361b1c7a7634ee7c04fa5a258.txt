MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a well-organized pattern with a 12.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background beta. Hyperventilation produces a small increase In amplitude. Photic stimulation elicits subtle driving.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third normal EEG for this adult. She is noted to have slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right which is a static finding for her. There are no pathological features noted.
