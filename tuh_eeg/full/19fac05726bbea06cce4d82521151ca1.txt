CLINICAL HISTORY:   66 year old right handed man with history of lung cancer, CHF, glaucoma, atrial fibrillation, osteomyelitis 40 years ago with bilateral below the knee amputations and left frontal aneurysm clipping, who presents with multiple episodes of slurred speech and left facial twitching, concerning for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with anterior and EKG electrodes.  The patient was lethargic during the examination.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant region that at best reaches 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  There is normal frontal central beta. Wakefulness and drowsiness is recorded during the recording. Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen continuously on the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
