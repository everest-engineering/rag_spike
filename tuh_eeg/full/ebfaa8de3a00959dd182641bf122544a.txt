CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old male with hepatitis C, cirrhosis, schizoaffective disorder.  Admitted with hypoglycemia, positive tox screen, urosepsis, and delirium.
MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone, Serax, rifaximin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was lethargic.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a routine 24-minute EEG which was technically acceptable with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow.  There is primarily a rhythmic theta pattern noted.  There is also a superimposed focality.  There is a glimpse of faster frequency noted in the left hemisphere, not so on the right.  There is a suggestion of a 5-6 Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the left, not identified on the right.  Bursts of FIRDA, frontally predominant intermittent rhythmic delta activity were noted.
Occasional bursts of shifting slowing were noted, as were occasional bursts of more sustained right focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal due to:
FIRDA
R focal slowing-intermittent
Generalized slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generalized background slowing and the FIRDA are supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function such as a metabolic encephalopathy.  The focal features in the right hemisphere suggest a process on the right affecting gray and white matter.  No seizures were identified.
