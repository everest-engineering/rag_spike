History: 36 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF INTERMITTENT SLURRED SPEECH, HEADACHES, MEMORY LOSS. ONSET 6 MONTHS AGO. ALSO EXCESSIVE SLEEPINESS AND NUMBNESS. PMHX: GASTRIC BYPASS SURG 1/13.
Medications: PREDNISONE
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background Is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. HR is 80 bpm.

Summary of Findings:
Normal EEG
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity is likely a medication effect This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
