CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed male with epilepsy since childhood, but continues to have tremor and fatigue.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. There is generous beta in the background. 14 and 6, a normal variant is noted in the background. Hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing is noted in the transition to sleep.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. Hyperventilation produces some paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.
HR:    70 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  14 and 6 shows a normal variant. This is the second EEG which was without epileptiform activity for this individual. The first was in 2005. In this individual who has been seizure free for a prolonged period of time an additional evaluation may be appropriate to determine the need for ongoing anti-seizure medications.
