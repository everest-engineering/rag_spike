History:	24 year man with seizures.
Medications:	Keppra and Neurontin - reportedly non-compliant
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces moderate
diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
