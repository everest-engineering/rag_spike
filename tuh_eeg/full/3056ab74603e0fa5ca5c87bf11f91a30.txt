CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old male, status post a complicated aneurysm surgery at age 55,
seizure-free for at least one month but known to have had complicated aneurysm surgery with
ventriculostomy and then another decompressive surgery.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Namenda
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Multiple craniotomy scars are noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized
with shifting arrhythmic delta activity. There is a suggestion at some point of a little bit more
rhythmic slowing on the left and the right and there are rare right temporal sharp waves, some
of which suggest a breach pathology. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Features
of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting slowing, perhaps a bit more so on the right.
3. Occasional right sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bi-hemispheric disturbance of cerebral
function. The sharp waves are on the right although the patient has a more significant
craniotomy defect on the left. Correlation with imaging is suggested.
