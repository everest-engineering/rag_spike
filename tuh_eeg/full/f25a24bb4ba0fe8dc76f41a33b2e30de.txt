CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old male with mesial temporal sclerosis, very poor historian, epilepsy, difficulty indicating how often he has seizures.
Medicines: DILANTIN
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This EEG captures limited sleep, but the patient was able to relax enough to stop his continued eye blinking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Very brief drowsiness is captured at the end of this 40 minute EEG and includes 2 bursts of theta noted from the left temporal region as well as POSTS.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 40 minute EEG must be considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 5th EEG for this patient.  In general, the patient does not fall asleep during the EEG and only 1 EEG identified subtle right temporal focal slowing in 2013.  This diagnostic dilemma is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy.
