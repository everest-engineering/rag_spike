ORIGINAL
CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old man with acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage and
seizures now status post craniectomy and decompression,
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY: Seizures.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode
placement system with additional anterior, temporal and EKG electrodes. The patient was
recorded during lethargy, No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None .
. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow background in the
delta and theta range with major frequencies ranging from 3 to 6 Hz. No posterior dominant
rhythm or normal frontal signs or beta seen. No sleep activity or acute abnormal architecture
seen. No activating procedures were performed. During the study the patient was stimulated
and there was an increase in the background to theta frequencies.
1. There is continuous C4 periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDS) seen at 1 Hz
with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.
2. Generalized slow waves.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right central PLEDS.
2. Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of acute structural dysfunction and
in the right central region, which is consistent with a known structural lesion. In
there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific, but In this case
due at Is in reaction to medication effect. No seizures were seen.
