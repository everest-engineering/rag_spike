History: 60 YR FEMALE WITH OM, HTN, BREAST CA SIP RIGHT MASTECTOMY(06), CHEMO
AND XRT 2007, CHF, WITH CC OF CHANGE IN MS. PER PT FELL AND MALL 4
DAYS AGO AND HAS BODY PAIN
Medications: Loaded with Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10.20 System; standard 21 electrodes with LTM electrodes, awake. Drowsy, photic.

Description:
The predominant background Is at best seen at 8 Hz, with a low voltage. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No local slowing Is present. No epileptiform discharges are present No clinical or electrographic seizures were present
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild interrogation.

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
