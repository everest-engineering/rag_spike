CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old adult male with learning disability and epilepsy, admitted on the 25th for prolonged postictal confusion.  The patient now has facial grimacing.  The patient has cerebral palsy, spastic paraplegia.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Dilantin, Protonix, heparin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside for an excited and agitated patient with frequent laughing and grimacing using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a 5-7 Hz theta pattern.  Prominent 7 Hz theta was also noted in the central regions and was not associated with any changes in the patient's behavior.  In relaxed wakefulness, there was a decrease in muscle and an overall pattern with a theta background, a little bit of slowing in the occipital regions noted occasionally in wakefulness.  At times there was a monomorphic background noted which does not react to eye opening.  Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to #1, replacement of normal background with excess theta.
Occasional posteriorly predominant delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen in this EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study in the lab, capturing sleep may be of value.
