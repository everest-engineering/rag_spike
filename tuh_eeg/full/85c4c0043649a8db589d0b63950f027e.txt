CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old male, who lost track of time for 4 hours on Saturday, April 13th.  Wife found him and observed a tonic-clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  not recorded
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a routine 20-minute EEG with technically appropriate impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background.  The patient appears to be relatively tense and there is a fair amount of muscle noted in the background.
Hyperventilation produced a small amount of theta.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this individual with a concern for recent seizure or a transient global amnesia attack, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be a value.
