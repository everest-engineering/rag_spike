History:	77 yr female with cc of episode of eyes rolled back and shaking t/c at episcopal with
urinary incontinence x30 sec. post confused. pt came to hospital for gen weakness found ari.
pmh x:  dm, htn, hld. posterior tia
Medications:	Metoprolol, Clonidine, Zocor, Norvasc
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-8.5Hz PDR, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  There is excess 6-7Hz theta during wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of diffuse background slowing.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
