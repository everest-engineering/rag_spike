CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 50-year-old man presented with loss of consciousness and incontinence. He is confused, not feeling well
and complains of generalized weakness , frontal headache and dizziness of 3 days duration.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Depression.
MEDICATIONS:
Zolpidem, citalopram, hydroxyzine and Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital Video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. This is an
inpatient recording. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
The background pattern is slow and disorganized. There is a lot of muscle artifact. Bilateral theta pattern is seen with more
slowing on the left frontal region with focal delta. There is shifting slowing seen bilaterally with arrhythmic delta.
Photic stimulation brings about scant driving.
Heart rate: 50 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A slow disorganized pattern.
2. Focal delta is seen in the left frontal region.
3. Arrhythmic delta bilaterally
Clinical correlation:
The slow disorganized bilateral arrhythmic delta is supportive of underlying white matter disturbance as can be seen with
edema. The focal left frontal delta can be correlated with the MRI.
