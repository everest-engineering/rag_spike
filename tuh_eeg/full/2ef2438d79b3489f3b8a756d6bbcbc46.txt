CLINICAL HISTORY:   57 year old right handed woman with hypertension and arthritis.  The patient had a slip and fall accident in May. She now has 2 weeks of dizziness and vertigo, worse on Sunday.  Symptoms occur with head turning to the left.
MEDICATIONS:  Vesicare, Naprosyn, Omeprazole, Neurontin, Lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was  performed.  This was an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by an increase in theta with a very small amount of shifting theta.  Brief epochs of stage I sleep include vertex waves.   Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.
HR:  90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be
considered.  A small amount of shifting slowing in drowsiness is an unremarkable finding for an adult of this age.
