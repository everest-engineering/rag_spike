CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old female with focal facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Depakote, Valproic Acid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, at times there is a 9.5 Hz alpha
rhythm identified, right greater than left. Occasional left posterior temporal or parietal
sharp waves at noted in the waking background. There is a fair amount of muscle noted
bilaterally. During the EEG, the patient had some episodes of right-sided jerking. The
right hand jerks. In this occasion, the right hand jerking sometimes has association with
the sharp wave noted in the left posterior quadrant. During the episodes with the hand
twitching, testing is not performed. Most of the episodes with elevation of the right wrist
are associated with a sharp wave, although the sharp wave can occur without the
movement. When the patient is awake formal testing is not performed during the hand
twitching.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left hemisphere.
2. Left parietal temporal sharp waves.
3. Jerking of the right hand which is almost always associated with sharp wave in the
same region, although not every sharp wave is associated with a jerk.
CLINICAL These findings have been previously outlined in her 4
other EEG's during this hospitalization. Testing to assess this patient's level of
awareness during the focal epileptiform discharges could be helpful.
