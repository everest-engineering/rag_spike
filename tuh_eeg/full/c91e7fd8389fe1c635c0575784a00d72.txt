DYSARTHRIA AND NAUSEA. CTA SHOWED LT ICA 70% - RT ICA 50%
STENOSIS / PRESENTS FOR LT CAROTID W/ STENTING
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Occasional delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of occasional focal slowing in the left
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
