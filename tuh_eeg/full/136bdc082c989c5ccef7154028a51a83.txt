CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 71-year-old woman with past history of stroke, cardiomyopathy, seizure-free for the past 4 years.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is a technically acceptable, routine 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The waking record is disrupted by intermittent, shifting, arrhythmic delta activity or arrhythmic theta activity.  From the right, this is relatively subtle but from the left, there are more, sustained bursts of focal slowing, some of which are sharply contoured.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and increase in beta and a slight accentuation of the focal slowing from the left temporal region with a sharply contoured slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate is 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Independent, right or left temporal slowing, relatively subtle on the right.
Focal slowing on the left, at times sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study is similar to a previous study of 2 years ago.  Of note, there is a bit more sharply contoured left focal slowing than was noted in the original study but neither study demonstrated definitive epileptiform features.
