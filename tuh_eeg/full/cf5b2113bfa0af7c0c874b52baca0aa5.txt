History:	91 YR FEMALE WITH EPISODES OF SPASTIC ATTACK PT CAN HEAR BUT
UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE.  EATS/ FEELS FULL WHILE GOING RESTROOM
HAS ATTACK,  HEAD TURNS BUT NO BODY SHAKING LAST SECONDS BUT
CAN HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES.  FINE POST. 4 EVENTS IN 10 YRS. PMHX: HTN,
Medications:	Lisinopril, Lasix, Coreg, Xarelto
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.
