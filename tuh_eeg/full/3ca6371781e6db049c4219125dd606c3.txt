CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy. A 51-year-old male with refractory complex partial epilepsy and transient left sided weakness.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital,  others


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness background EEG is slow with a 7
Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is significant artifact in the T2 greater than T1 electrodes which in fact suggests that the T2 electrode may not be entirely plugged in as there is double phase reversing artifact. Despite this, independent right anterior temporal sharp and slow wave complexes are noted.

Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Sleep was characterized by vertex waves.  High amplitude independent right and left temporal sharp waves are noted.

Heart rate 60 b.p.m.


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background slowing.
2.	Independent right and left temporal sharp waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   Previous EEGs are not available today for comparison but this patient is known to have temporal lobe epilepsy.
