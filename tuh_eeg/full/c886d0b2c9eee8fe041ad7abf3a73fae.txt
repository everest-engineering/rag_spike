REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old man with a history of previous left MCA stroke and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with alcohol abuse, now with new onset seizures with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at home and another one in the ER.
MEDICATIONS:  Serax.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some temporal muscle artifact seen continuously throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere.  The patient has frontal central beta seen best over the right hemisphere and some attenuation over the left.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere seen throughout the recording, maximal at the temporal regions.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to attenuation of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere maximum in the central temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of cortical dysfunction over the left hemisphere, maximal at the central temporal region which is consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
