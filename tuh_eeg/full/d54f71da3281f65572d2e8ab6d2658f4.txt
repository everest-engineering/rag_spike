CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old right handed male with a history of seizures for 30 years following a head trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Sleep stage 2 was recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening.  Sleep stage 2 is noted.  Activating procedures include photic stimulation and hyperventilation.  There is periodic independent bitemporal slowing maximal at T3-T4 at 2-4 Hz, at times the left occurring more often than right.  At times, these slow waves are sharply contoured.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Independent T3-T4 2-4 Hz slow waves which at times are sharply contoured.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
