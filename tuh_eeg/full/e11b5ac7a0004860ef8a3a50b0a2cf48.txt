CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old male with declining mental status, diabetes, hypertension, left hemispheric strokes and pacemaker.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Tegretol, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 22 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a 6 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alerting the patient produces a dropout of the alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG is a bit more rhythmic.  There is subtle, shifting delta noted infrequently in the record, slightly more so on the left frontocentral than the right.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record, but did elicit photoelectric artifact.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic background slowing.
Subtle underlying left focal slowing.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
No epileptiform features were identified.  The generalized background slowing is a nonspecific finding, supporting a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The subtle focal features noted are congruent with the previous history of left-sided ischemic stroke.  This EEG is similar to prior studies.
