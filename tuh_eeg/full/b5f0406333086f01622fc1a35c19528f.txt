CABG FOUND AT HM, EMS V FIB ARREST ON 1/18, DEFIB X 2. EPI X 3 WITHIN
10 MIN PULSES ON ARRIVAL/ ? HYPOXIC DUE TO DECOMPENSATION
Medications:	FENTANYL, HEPARIN, NITROGLYCERIN, VANCOMYCIN, ZOSYN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present at 1HZ
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag and
become more pronounced with stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at T3 and at F7/T3.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to tactile
stimuli.  HR was 102 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, continuous
Sharp waves, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Sharp waves, frequent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the left mid and
anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of an irritable and potentially
epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition there are  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves
and severe diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
