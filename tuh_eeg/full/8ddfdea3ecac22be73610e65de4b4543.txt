LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 63-year-old woman with past medical history of atrial fibrillation and metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent left frontal craniotomy on 08/21/2012.  She now presents with expressive aphasia and generalized weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dexamethasone, Lovenox and metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and  T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of low to moderate amplitude  polymorphic mixture of theta and delta with occasional triphasic wave forms.  Additional intermittent theta and delta are captured over the left frontocentral region.   Sleep is not captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  No electrographic seizures are seen.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate with a heart rate up to 150 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Focal left frontocentral slowing.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 23-minute awake only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and focal left frontocentral slowing and triphasic wave forms.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction that in his case could partially be related to toxic metabolic etiology.  Triphasic waves are observed in different forms of encephalopathy.  Focal left frontocentral slowing could be secondary to an underlying cerebral dysfunction that is structural in etiology and is consistent with the patient's history of left frontal craniotomy.  Cardiac arrhythmia with heart rate up to 150 beats a minute is noted in the single EKG lead.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.
