CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed gentleman with bilateral strokes, epilepsy, and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Toradol, Baclofen, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a bedside study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized with shifting slowing. There are sharp waves noted in this record, including left anterior temporal or occipital.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Background disorganization.
3. Sharp waves identified from the left anterior and right posterior region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both hemispheres. Epileptiform activity has been previously identified for this individual from both hemispheres, although the exact location is somewhat different today.
