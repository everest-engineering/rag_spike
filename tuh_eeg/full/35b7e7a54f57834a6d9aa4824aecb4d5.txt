CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old male with epilepsy, right occipital hematoma, status post craniectomy.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Codeine, Phenytoin, Morphine, Lorazepam, Acetaminophen, Colace, Pepcid

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a hard collar, has multiple drains and is difficult to position. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous, mixed frequency pattern. The activity is significantly lower on the right compared to the left. There is a bit more faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right. The overall pattern is a very slow pattern with fast activity and then delta. Ativan is administered during the EEG and seems to accentuate the slowing. There are some artifacts in the record but no definitive sharp waves. The technologist notes that the craniectomy is on the left.

HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A pattern of rhythmic slowing.
2. An asymmetry with lower voltage slower activity on the right compared to the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are typical of those seen in a subdural hematoma and/or craniectomy. No epileptiform features are observed. Because of this, a followup EEG when the patient recovers is important to more completely characterize the epilepsy that may have led to the head trauma.
