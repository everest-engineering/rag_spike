CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old woman presents with a history of prolonged postictal state after 3 generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  The last one was 7 years ago.  She presents with a history of falling down at home and found 4 days later in bed in the same position.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Morphine
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  The background consists of generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts, seen continuously throughout the recording.  At one point the patient stimulated and there appears to be an increase in muscle artifact and slight improvement on the frequencies, but mainly remaining in the delta frequency.  At times there were some sharply contoured frontal wave forms, but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
