LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 38-year-old man who presents with new onset generalized tonoclonic convulsion.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan and Narcan.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The patient is asleep throughout the majority of the recording.  During a brief period of wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 11 Hz alpha activity with a preserved anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  There is continuous diffuse excess beta activity.  The majority of the recording is captured during sleep.  Occasional vertex waves and K complexes are present.  There is continuous left  temporal delta activity that at times is semi-rhythmic.  Intermittent variable amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are captured over the F7, T3 and C3 electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Heart rate up to 120 beats per minute is observed.
FINDINGS:
Focal left temporal slowing, at times semi-rhythmic.
Left hemispheric epileptiform discharges with phase reversal over F7 and T3 electrodes and C3 electrode.  No  electrographic seizures.
Excess beta.
Mostly sleep EEG.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal briefly awake and mostly asleep nearly 21 minute EEG due to continuous moderate left temporal slowing, that at time is semi-rhythmic, and intermittent left anterior temporal/central epileptiform discharges. These findings indicate focal left temporal dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, that carries increased epileptogenic potential.  Excess beta is likely secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines and all barbiturates.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
