CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 80-year-old woman with dementia and 1 week change in mental status with occasional jerkiness of limbs.
MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone, Benadryl, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is poorly responsive, and occasional muscle twitch artifact was noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta, frequency activity of approximately 4-7 Hospitalization.  As she becomes drowsy there is an increase in beta.  Occasional muscle jerks were not associated with epileptiform activity.  Rare triphasic waves were noted.  Features of drowsiness included increase in beta.
Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The muscle jerking was not associated with epileptiform activity.  This EEG is more supportive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  Dementia, however, can produce similar changes.
