History:	51 YO MALE WITH SZ HX,  LAST SZ 3 MONTHS AGO, W/O LOC. STROKES X 2
IN 1998, DX WITH SARCOIDOSIS.
Medications:	MOTRIN, LACHYDRIN, DEPAKOTE, LUMINAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse 6-7 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Almost continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left temporal region (maximum at F7
and T3) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Almost
continuous focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesion in this region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
