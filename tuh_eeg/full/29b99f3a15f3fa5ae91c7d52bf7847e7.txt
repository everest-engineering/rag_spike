CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old male with a TIA, left carotid stenosis, hepatitis C. This is a pre-op EEG for a left carotid endarterectomy.

MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Oxycodone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is in isolation which limits the technologist's testing but photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF .THE RECORD: In apparent wakefulness the background EEG is
well organized but the alpha rhythm is somewhat slow at 7.5 Hz. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR-: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. No focal features
were noted. The background slowing of the alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding and may be correlated with clinical history. This study will be used for the patient's endarterectomy baseline.
