ANYONE F/H/O SEIZURES BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER SIDE. 57 CM HEAD.
Medications:	XANAX, NAPROXEN.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  During the EEG the patient
has an event of arms shaking, heavy breathing and eyes flickering. She responds to questions and
states that this is her typical seizure.  No EEG correlate is seen.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The episode captured above had no EEG
correlate and the behavior is consistent with a psychogenic non epileptic event.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
