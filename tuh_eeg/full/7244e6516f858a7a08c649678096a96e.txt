History:	24 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF STATUS.  PMHX: MENINGITIS ENCEPHALITIS AT
AGE 3, VNS 2013 (JEFFERSON), IBS.
Medications:	Propofol, Ativan, Dilantin, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Infrequently a posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz  Overall the background activity was
characterized by a disorganized diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Almost continuous focal slowing is present over the right centro-temporal region and bifrontal
regions.  High amplitude epileptiform discharges are seen in the central region at C3/CZ and
CZ/C4 at times with a more frontal component.  These appear in rhythmic bursts for seconds.
Frequent bilateral frontal discharges are seen at F7 and F8 independently.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 114
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of frequent bifrontal independent as well as central spike and
sharp waves, which are supportive of a multifocal epilepsy.  In addition, diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
