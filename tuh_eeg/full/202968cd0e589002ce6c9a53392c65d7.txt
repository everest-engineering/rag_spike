CLINICAL HISTORY:  47 year old right handed female with hypertension, headaches, with weakness and numbness in the limbs, found to have a tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Caduet, Hydrocodone, Vicodin
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is lack of normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, but of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
