MEDICATIONS: None reported.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG Is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is present on the right, something There is frontal delta, most prominent in the left frontal region, but to some extent picked up at t generous field of spread. It involves the frontal, central, frontotemporal region, and midline. Features including increase in background slowing. Vertex waves emerge as the patient transition to standard sustained.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to
1 Prominent, left frontal delta.
2 left hemispheric focal slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The left frontal delta is congruent with a history of a left frontal mass. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study will be of value.
