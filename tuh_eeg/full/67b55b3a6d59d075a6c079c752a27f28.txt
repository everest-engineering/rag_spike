CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old male with seizures 5 years ago and then January 2014 and again October 2014.  History of hypertension, chronic anticoagulation with anticardiolipin antibody.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Warfarin, Zocor, others
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG includes a well organized, symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with rhythmic central theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through brief stage 1 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  This is the second normal EEG for this patient.
