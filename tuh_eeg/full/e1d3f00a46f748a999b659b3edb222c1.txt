History:	63 year old woman with a brainstem stroke.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta> delta
activity.  There is continuous excess EMG artifact over the right midtemporal leads.  No normal
sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No reactivity
Artifact, EMG, continuous, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal comatose portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and lack of
clear background reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Presence of continuous excessive EMG artifact over the right temporal
leads makes interpretation of the right temporal activity unreliable.
