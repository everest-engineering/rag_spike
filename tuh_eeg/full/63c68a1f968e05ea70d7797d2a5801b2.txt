History:	31 year old man with a history of seizures since childhood.  Seizures are described
as mouth numbness and metallic taste in his mouth, followed by tachycardia, right
sided numbness, then bilateral numbness and then a convulsion
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the  left temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness and sleep.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left temporal region and produces mild diffuse slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation
from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to occasional mild left temporal slowing.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin.
