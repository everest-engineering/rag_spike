History: 73 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/0 MAINLY RT HAND/ARM SHAKING
LASTING 5-10 SECONDS, HAS OCCURRED IN LT. ONSET 3-4 MOS. AGO PT
DENIES LOCI UNRESPONSIVENESS DURING EPISODE. PMHX SIG CVA 2001 AND
HLD
Medications: Neurontin, Keppra.
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake. hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record
slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity. and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. Frequent focal spikes are present in the left anterior temporal region. with
phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7ff3.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake. drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in
the left anterior temporal region. These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization related
epilepsy intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative
of focal cerebral .dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
