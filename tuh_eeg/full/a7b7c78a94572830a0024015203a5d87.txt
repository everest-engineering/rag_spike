History:	63 year old woman with a reported seizure in 7/2014.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The waking background is characterized by a 25-40 uV, 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
Monomorphic nearly continuous diffuse frontally predominant 3-4 Hz delta activity is captured.
Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  HR was 72.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is likely a normal awake-only 41-minute EEG.  Underriding monomorphic diffuse frontally
predominant delta activity is of unclear clinical significance. Similar activity was captured on the
7/2014 EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
