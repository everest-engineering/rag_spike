History:	59 YR. OLD MALE R HANDED. PMHX. DM TYPE 1 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
HIGH CHOL. NOW PRESENTS IN SAME DAY OF FALLING BACKWARDS NEVER
LOC FEELS FINE AFTERWARDS. NO FAMILY H/O SEIZURES.
Medications:	METOPROLOL,ZETIA, BISACODYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not induces significant photic
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 41 minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A normal EEG does not rule out the
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
