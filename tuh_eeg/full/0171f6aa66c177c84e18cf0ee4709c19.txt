History:	65 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O RT MCA CARDIO EMBOLIC ISCHEMIC
STROKE WITH WORSENING MENTAL STATUS
Medications:	Ativan and Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is loss of faster frequencies over this region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 108
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
