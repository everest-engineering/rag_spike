EEG DEPT
History: 19 Y/0MALE WITH PMHX. OF SZS. PT DESCRIBED SZ AS TONIC CLONIC WITH
LOC FOR A FEW MINUTES. LAST SZ OVER2 YRS.
FOLLOW UP EEG.
Medications: KEPPRA, LAMICTAL, RITALIN, VIT-C, CALCIUM CARBONATE, THERAGRAN
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake. drowsy, hyperventilation. photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric S.15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During limited drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes
more prominent and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. There was one frontal
theta discharge in drowsiness that had a somewhat sharp appearance.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR 42

interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and limited asleep
