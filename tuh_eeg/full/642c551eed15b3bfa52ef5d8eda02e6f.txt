HISTORY:  A 27-year-old woman presented to Episcopal Hospital after 2 seizures with right-sided posturing and then 1 minute of shaking followed by 20 minutes of confusion.  No tongue biting or incontinence.
MEDICINES:  Keppra, Zofran, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity and abundant lambda.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, spindles, and posts.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort, did not significantly activate the record.
HEART RATE:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
