CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old gentleman with schizophrenia, infrequent falling, fell three times in the last three months, no incontinence, no evidence of a seizure.

MEDICATIONS:  Haldol, Cogentin.


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was attempted, and photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was relatively somnolent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  A maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized.  The alpha rhythm ranges from 9 to 10 Hz posterior symmetric background.  There are minor shifting asymmetries and head rocking.

The patient is quite drowsy, and in drowsiness there is an increase in background theta, followed by vertex waves.  He transitions in and out of sleep.

Hyperventilation serves to alert the patient, but he cannot sustain the activity.

Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.

Heart rate 108 BPM, occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to mild background slowing and disorganization for an adult of this age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  The background slowing and disorganization may be related to this patient's underlying neuropsychiatric pathology.  In this adult with a history of frequent, unexpected falling, additional evaluation in regard to the tachycardia may be appropriate.
