CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed male with epilepsy, new onset seizures. Patient fell off the bed after drinking heavily, has 2 prior histories of head traumas including a bicycle accident at age 25 and a motorcycle accident at age 35. Frontal encephalomalacia, question epilepsy versus alcohol withdrawal seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is new awake and asleep record in a somewhat uncooperative individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. There is generous beta in wakefulness and early drowsiness. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a subtle asymmetry in development of central delta with a bit more slowing observed in the right central region. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal due to:
1. Subtle, right central delta in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generous beta may be due to this patient's medications. No epileptiform features were observed. The focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.
