CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male transferred from another hospital on March 1, with coagulopathy and epistaxis followed by an intracerebral hemorrhage.  Now intubated and comatose without cranial nerve signs.

MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol, vancomycin, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, comatose and unresponsive.  ECS montage was utilized and the total duration of the study was 50 minutes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Using conventional parameters, the EEG is flat and suppressed.  Using the ECS montage with a sensitivity of 2 as well as other montages, there is scant, intermittent cerebral activity with some low voltage theta frequency activity at C4 and occasional, slower lower voltage delta at C2/ F2.  Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  There is no reactivity or variability.

Heart rate 102 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked paucity of cerebral activity.
2. Scant, low voltage theta in the right central region with scant very slow delta in the right central region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe, devastating CNS insult in the appropriate clinical context.  The pattern described above has been described as island of cerebral of activity.  This patterning of cerebral activity typically diminishes over time.  A repeat EEG in 24 hours may be of value.
