CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed woman with 4 tonic-clonic seizures last month, admitted with confusion, the patient reported an aura just prior to this EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Topamax, Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It is somewhat slow, but with stimulation at times there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, it slows with generous beta and a theta background.
Interictal epileptiform abnormalities in this record include bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant delta, some left frontal maximum 2-3 Hz spike and slow wave activity and left posterotemporal or occipital high amplitude spike activity.  This EEG demonstrates less in the way of right temporal sharp waves than previous studies.
Features of drowsiness include an accentuation of the epileptiform activity described above as well as slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation may have accentuated some of the epileptiform activity, but when the patient was stimulated, there is an arousal and a decrease in epileptiform activity.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Slow spike and wave activity.
Left frontal spike and wave activity.
Left occipital spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is not significantly different than the previous study.  No definitive clinical seizures were noted.
