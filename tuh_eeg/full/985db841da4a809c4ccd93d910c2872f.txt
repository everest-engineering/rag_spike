CLINICAL HISTORY:  23 year old right handed female with history of head trauma to the right temporal region, bipolar schizophrenia, and seizures, presents for repeat EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Abilify, Trazodone.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at T1/F7-T3 with an amplitude of 20-80 microvolts seen very frequently throughout the recording.
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously over the left hemisphere at F7/T1 and very infrequently in the right hemisphere at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal sharp waves in the left anterior temporal region.
Independent bitemporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of bilateral independent anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
