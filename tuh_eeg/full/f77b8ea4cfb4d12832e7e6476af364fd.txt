Medications: 	Versed, Ativan, Propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, lethargic, obtunded
No posterior dominant rhythm is present. The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies Is not seen.   Background activity is slow and attenuated consisting of  2Â·3 Hz delta activity intermixed with 4-6 Hz theta activity. Sleep  architecture as sleep spindles Is noted.
Intermittent 1.5  Hz delta activity is present in  the left temporal region maximal at T3fT5.  No  epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is not performed. There is  spontaneous reactivity.  HR  is 100  bpm. Two episodes of body jerking are not associated with ictal EEG changes.
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal diffuse slowing, polymorphic, reactive generalized
Diffuse slowing and attenuation are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. which is consistent with a toxic-metabolic or bilateral structural disturbance of uncertain etiology intermittent focal slowing In the left temporal region. This finding is Indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non specific.
