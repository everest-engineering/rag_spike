CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 74-year-old man with history of a stroke 17 years ago now with seizures for the past 2 years, the last one was on February 2, 2013 while asleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, metoprolol, Protonix, simvastatin, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that best reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 60.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing is seen independently at F7/T3 and F8/T4 (more on the right than the left) at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Mild generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz, amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral independent anterior temporal focal slowing in addition to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions and additional mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
