History:	92 year old man found down with left arm shaking an difficulty speaking, found to
have a right lacunar infarct. Now here for repeat EEG 22 days post-admit.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep
architecture was present. Some state changes can be noted.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant with some central
spread.  At times sharply countoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left posterior quadrant, Some central spread
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right posterior region.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is  diffuse
background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators
of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
