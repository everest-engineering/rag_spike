REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and TIA, who presents to the hospital after falling.  The patient was found in the bathroom by son confused and talking nonsense for about 1 hour.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, bumetanide, aspirin, famotidine, lisinopril, and isosorbide.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with anterior temporal single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded through wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F74/D3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and up to 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  The heart rate was 78 and regular.
