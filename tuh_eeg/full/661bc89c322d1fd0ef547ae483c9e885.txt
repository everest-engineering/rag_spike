CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 26-year-old woman, who had a seizure on September 28th, taken to an outside hospital, associated with right-sided tongue biting and headache.  Previous normal EEG 1 year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.  It is technically satisfactory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta, again with generous beta.  Brief stage 2 sleep included spindles and POSTS.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 1-hour EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generous beta, and the vigorous and supraharmonic driving response are both normal features.
