History:	83 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CAD S/P CABG, COPD, HTN, HLD, PAD, S/P CAROTID BYPASS PRESENTING S/P PEA ARREST ON 3/20/14 X 30 MIN.
Medications:	Versed, Depakote Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes


Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.

No focal slowing is present.  In the occipital region (01>02) there are periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges at 2-3Hz and a low amplitude of 10-20uV. They do not appear to clearly evolve. The patient also has intermittent sudden truncal jerks clinically that have no EEG correlate, consistent with myoclonus.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.

Summary of Findings:
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges}, continuous, bilateral (L>R} occipital Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Other, frequent, Myoclonus with no EEG correlate

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in the occipital region. These findings are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the region. The patient also appears to exhibit independent frequent clinical
myoclonus with no EEG correlate. Lastly, there is severe diffuse background slowing and absence alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. No electrographic seizures are present.
