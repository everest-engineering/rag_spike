CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman with epilepsy, admitted with heart failure. Admitted with heart failure and a cecal abnormality 1 month ago.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Dilantin, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry. In the right hemisphere there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. The activity is slightly slow with a small amount of theta. The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent to nearly continuous focal slowing, some of which is sharply contoured in the mid to anterotemporal region. There are rare sharp waves, maximum at T3 but with generous spread both anterior and posterotemporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha frequency activity on the left. As the patient drifts off to sleep, the intrahemispheric asymmetry becomes a bit more prominent, again with slowing on the left.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximum in the left temporal region.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
3. Mild slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left and is typical of that seen in complex partial epilepsy. Correlation with previous history and imaging is important to determine if this is a new pattern or a chronic pattern.
