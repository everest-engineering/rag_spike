History:	89 year old man with recurrent episodes of decreased responsiveness.
Medications:	propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
With maximal stimulation, the background consists of low amplitude polymorphic 8-9 Hz activity
posteriorly and weak AP gradient.  Overall, the background is attenuated and consists of a mixture
of theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Other, sedated recording
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 23-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing that is captured with maximal
stimulation.  Otherwise, the recording demonstrates sedated background. These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that, in this case, at least
partially related to the medication effect.
