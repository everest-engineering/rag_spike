CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old male with a history of generalized tonic clonic seizures, seizure free for the last 2 years, encephalitis or hydrocephalus, one of the two.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9.5 Hertz alpha rhythm.  Intermittent, brief burst of rhythmic frontal 4-6 Hertz theta activity are noted in wakefulness, typically less than 1 second in duration.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits driving with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.  Heart rate 126 BMP.
IMPRESSION:  This electroencephalogram is remarkable for:
Rare bursts of frontal theta in apparent wakefulness.
Tachycardia.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Previous EEGs were not available at this time.  Additional clinical correlation is suggested.
