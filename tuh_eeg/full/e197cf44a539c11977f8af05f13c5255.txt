History:	36 YR OLD FEMALE UNKNOWN HAND DOMINANCE. PMHX.HTN  CANCER.NO H/O
SEIZURES PER BOYFRIEND/HUSBAND.  PT TAKEN IN ED LAST EVENING FOR
RESPIRATORY FAILURE.
Medications:	DEPACON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-9Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
