CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed male admitted with 4 seizures, alcohol abuse, past history of intracerebral hemorrhage, hepatitis C, stroke, and hypertension.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tylenol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left. Faster frequency activity is attenuated on the right. The patient is conversant with the tech. This patient has an event during the EEG. The event occurs at 10:08 a.m. It is characterized by staring, jerking of the head from side to side. The EEG is remarkable for some sharp waves and some motion artifacts. The sharp waves are seen in the right frontocentral region. There is significant muscle activity. The patient is conversant during the spell. No postictal slowing is noted. Photic stimulation elicits a brief driving response on the left.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right.
2. An event during the EEG without impairment of awareness. Although there is some artifact, there are some discharges in the same region as the patient's sharp waves. While the event might not be considered a simple partial or a complex partial seizure, the motor activity observed may be linked to the epileptiform activity elicited from the right frontocentral region which could have produced the features described above.
