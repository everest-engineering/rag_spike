55 year old with a history of status epilepticus post anoxic injury.
MEDICATIONS: Mycamine, Heparin, Phenobarbital, Cefepime,
Norepinephrine
INTRODUCTION: video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using the
standard 10-20 of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation
and photic are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD :EEG pattern during this overnight recording INCLUDES MORE OF A BURST SUPPRESSION
or post anoxic pattern with generalized high amplitude activity particularly
in the frontal regions. In the first several hours it is possible to the right
frontocentral spike but over time this dissipates really to more
Stimulation of the patient does not seem to produce an alerting response
IMPRESSION: EEG due to:
1. A more typical of a post anoxic pattern with a generalized pattern of burst
suppression.
These findings are more typical of a post anoxic pattern
and are pattern at this time.
