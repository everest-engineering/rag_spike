History:	56 year old man who presents with seizures.  pmhx: sz, dm, htn
Medications:	Oxcarbazepine, Phenobarbital, Metoprolol, Famotidine, Heparin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The predominant background is characterized by an alpha rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz.
Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere seen maximal in the
temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 54.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal in the temporal region
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere seen
maximal in the temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
In addition there is diffuse background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
