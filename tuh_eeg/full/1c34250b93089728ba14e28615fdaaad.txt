AGE: 32 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 09/10/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient EEG TYPE: 95819
EEG # : 15-1326
HISTORY :
32 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for	BLACK OUT 2 DAYS AGO WHILE EXERCISING. PT LOC WITH SHAKING EYES ROLLED UP LASTING 20 - 30 SECONDS , PT returned BACK TO BASELINE IN 1 MINUTE. SAME EPISODE X2 : 2000 AND 2003. PT HAS "RAYNAUDS DISEASE".
MEDICATIONS:
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit. Norvasc
SEDATION: none TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically limited record as the single channel of EKG was not functioning, HV and photic stimulation were completed.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically	Â· with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There was generous beta noted
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: did not activate the record Photic Stimulation: elicited vigorous driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
Dysfunctional	EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.	Consider repeat study with EKG and stage II sleep if epilepsy an important consideration
