History:	18 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH EPISODE OF LOC WITH FALL ON 11/25/15.
PT REPORTS 2 PRIOR EVENTS OF SHAKING WITH NO LOC. H/O HEAD INJURY
AT AGE 5 / HIT BY VAN.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles appear.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional brief 1-2 seconds bursts of generalized frontally-maximal 4-
5 Hz spike-and-wave discharges occur during the recording.  Some of them appear to be
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, occasional generalized
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent generalized spike-and-
wave discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise normal.
These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
