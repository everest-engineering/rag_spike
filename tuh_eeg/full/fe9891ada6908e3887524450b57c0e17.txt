DATE OF STUDY:  06/17/2015 to 06/18/2015.
MEDICATIONS:  Multiple medications for gastritis, no antiseizure medications.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old right handed woman with recent, adult onset episodes of epigastric sensations.  The patient reports that symptoms began several years ago, after profound sleep deprivation, at which time, she was confused.  Currently symptoms are more intense, but are not associated with impairment of awareness.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  One clinical event was noted.
Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Event:  10:38 p.m.  The patient was awake in bed.  She presses the button and a nurse comes to perform testing.  The patient did report to the nurse that she felt the butterflies in the stomach, no impairment of awareness, and thus the symptoms were mild.  There was no scalp correlate with these symptoms.
Heart rate:  80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Day 1 continuous video EEG remarkable for one clinical event without EEG change.  Of note, a simple partial seizure as reported by this patient would not necessarily carry a scalp EEG correlate.
