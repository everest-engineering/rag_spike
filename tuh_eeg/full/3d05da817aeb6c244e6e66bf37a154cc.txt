History:	47 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED.PT WAS TAKEN IN BY HUSBAND PT WAS NOT
ABLE TO BREATH AND CODE IN CAR. HUSBANDS SAYS THEY WERE CLOSE
TO HOSPITAL NOT FAR AT ALL ON BROAD TIOGA. 57 CM HEAD NO FAMILY
H/O SEIZURES.
Medications:	MIDAZOLAM, PROPOFOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Bursts of quasi -periodic and frontal/central predominant complex
polyphasic sharp waves are present, with a repetition rate of 4Hz. They do not appear to evolve.  At
the beginning of the record they appear to have muscle correlate that is not later seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 114
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous frontal, Quasi-periodic polyspikes.
Attenuation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  quasi periodic frontal predominant generalized
discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic and represent diffuse cortical irritability. In addition
there is  severe diffuse background attenuation, which is indicative of a severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction. In the setting of hypoxic injury this pattern forbodes a poor prognosis.  The patient will
