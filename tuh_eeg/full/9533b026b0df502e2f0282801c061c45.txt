CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old woman with facial droop, left sided weakness. heart failure.
MEDICATIONS: ASA, Diovan, Lovenox. Metoprolol, Zocor, Clonidine, Robitussin, Zithromax,
Ceftriaxone, Nitroglycerin, Zofran, Loperamide, Cepacol
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement With 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. There is overall slow background with bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing. In addition, there is an asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity noted in the right hemisphere in comparison to the left. There is a bit more slow, featureless delta in the right posterior quadrant in comparison to the left Some of this is sharply contoured. Features of drowsiness include in an background slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Notably, at the end of the record, the patient does seem to be much more interactive and there is briefly a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm which is identified left greater than the right, followed by bursts of FIRDA. There is also a burst of sharply contoured slowing in the central regions at the very end of the record.
HR: 90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, prominent background slowing.
2. Focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests both a chronic or metabolic or diffuse process,
as well as focal process. The FIRDA and generalized slowing are generalized processes, but
the focal features are supportive of a structural pathology. No epileptiform features were
identified.
