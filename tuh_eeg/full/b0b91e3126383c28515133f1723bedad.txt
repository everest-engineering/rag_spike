CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 22-year-old woman with epilepsy starting from childhood. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bowel or urine incontinence and a postictal phase.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol and Topamax.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the EEG Long-term Monitoring Unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP:
The background EEG is symmetric and fairly organized. Occasionally, rhythmic slowing with theta activity was identified.  Compared to early portions, there was less generalized background slowing.  The patient also advanced to stage II sleep.During sleep, spindles and vertex waves were seen.  Sleep was fragmented.

SEIZURES:
Five events were reported by the patient: 11:19, 12:24, 12:31, 17:47, and 19:55. The patient complained of abdominal pain at that time which she described as “only a mild seizure”. On the video, we observed the patient, after pushing the button, to put her hand over her abdomen for a while but no other behavior was identified. No EEG change was seen with any of these seizures.  The EEG demonstrates excess theta during all of these spells.  There is some variability in the background beta but no clear epileptiform pattern.

HR:  78 BPM.
