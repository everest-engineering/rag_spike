CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old male who had a seizure out of sleep, patient was told that he fell out of bed and was amnestic for events until he awoke at the

Emergency Room.



MEDICATIONS:  None.



INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory 20 minute EEG with impedances below 5 kilo-ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Significant head rocking artifact was noted.  Lambda was noted.



Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.



The patient seems to be drifting off to sleep during hyperventilation but there was an increase in amplitude noted.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.



Heart rate:  66 BPM.



IMPRESSION:  Electroencephalogram within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
