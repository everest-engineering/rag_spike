History:	PT HAS FALLEN AT LEAST 4 TIMES OVER THE PAST 4 MTHS. COMPLAINS OF
H/A AT LEAST 2-3 TIMES/WK; ALSO COMPLAINS OF BLURRY VISION.
R/O SEIZURE ACTIVITY
Medications:	none listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 90  There is asymmetry in the amplitude of the occipital rhythm,
with higher amplitude seen on the left, noted only in a bipolar montage.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
