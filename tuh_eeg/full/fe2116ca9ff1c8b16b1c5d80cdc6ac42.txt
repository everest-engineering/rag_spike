HISTORY:
A 56-year-old male with epilepsy. Characteristics of his seizures include loss of consciousness with focal right motor
activity involving the right arm and leg and then incontinence. Past history of cocaine and alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia,
diabetes and a brain tumor
DATE OF ADMISSION:
July 25, 2011.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, Ativan, simvastatin, Indocin and others.
ROOM NUMBER:
NICU 783.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with
one-channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The overall background EEG includes a pattern of diffuse beta. The patient is awake, moving about with eye
movements. In addition, there is some slow artifact noted on the left with 0.5 to 1.5 Hz delta, which resembles an artifact
rather than a biological signal. Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening. By the end of the record, the patient is significantly more awake, although the overall pattern is beta pattern.
There is an amplitude asymmetry with a bit higher amplitude beta in the right frontocentral region compared to the left.
Heart rate 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION
Abnormal EEG due to a pattern excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION
No epileptiform features were found. There is no mention regarding a previous neurosurgery or breech rhythm, but there as an amplitude asymmetry on the right.
