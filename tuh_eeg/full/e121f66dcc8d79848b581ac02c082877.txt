REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures and altered mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 85-year-old woman with a previous left MCA stroke, status post IV/IA tPA in August 2012, has a history of hypertension,  hypothyroidism, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, metoprolol, famotidine, Cardizem, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at T4.  Note:  There is also some sharp transients in the prefrontal region on the left at FP1.
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude 20-40 microvolts.
Heart rate:  136.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right mid temporal focal sharp waves, as well as moderate to severe generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy.  Seizures are likely arising from the right mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
