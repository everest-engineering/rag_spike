CLINICAL HISTORY: A 74-year-old right-handed woman status post cardiac arrest on 03/17/2013.  No CPR at home but intubated by EMS.  Critically ill patient.  Additional history not available but plan is for hypothermic protocol. Status post cardiac arrest on Sunday, 03/17/2013.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Demerol, midazolam (not recorded since 03/18/2013), Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a 16-hour EEG. Clinical features of the patient were not reported.  The patient is intubated and comatose on the video.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of this EEG includes a slow generalized diffuse periodic complex, which is maximum in the frontal regions and is 2 Hz in frequency.  There is a small degree of variability.
By 4:45 a.m. there were periods where the activity seems to slow a bit.
Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
By 8:00 a.m. the activity was slowing to 1.75 Hz.
Heart rate 48 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This overnight recording demonstrates a slow periodic complex superimposed over a featureless background.  There is no reactivity and little in the way of variability.  These findings support a severe underlying encephalopathy.  Although clinical examination is not known, these are worrisome findings.
