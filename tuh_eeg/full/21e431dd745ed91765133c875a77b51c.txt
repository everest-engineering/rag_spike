CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old woman with episodic tachypnea, dizziness, and a hallucinatory feeling in her vision followed by trembling legs.  Symptoms present since 2007. Now debilitating.
MEDICATIONS: Ultram, Flexeril, triptan, and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Twenty-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances under 20 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and a more diffuse distribution of the beta.  Wicket was noted as the patient transitions into drowsiness.  Stage I sleep includes POSTS followed by arousal.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate:  108 bpm while awake and 66 bpm while drowsy.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this adult.  No epileptiform features were identified in the 2 studies thus far.
