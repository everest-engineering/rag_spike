CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 45-year-old male with epilepsy, mental retardation, psychosis, and __________.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Technically satisfactory 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient had difficulty cooperating with the study.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, there is an overall theta frequency pattern.  The patient drifts off to sleep and if he does, there is an increase in beta.
Epileptiform features in this record include primarily left anterior temporal or midtemporal sharp waves and spikes of variable amplitude.  In the transition to drowsiness, intermittent rhythmic slowing is noted on the left.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
In stage 2 sleep, vertex waves, K complexes, spindles were noted.  In addition, some bifrontal sharp waves or spikes were also identified.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to.
Significant, diffuse background slowing.
Superimposed focal sharp waves noted primarily from the left hemisphere including left anterior temporal region.
Occasional bifrontal sharp waves or spikes noted in sleep.
Occasional bursts of rhythmic slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter.  A focal mechanism for epilepsy may be considered.  These findings may be correlated with imaging.
