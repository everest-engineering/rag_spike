CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed woman with chief complaint of myoclonic jerks when awake, sometimes with head drop.  The patient is not sure what is happening.  Onset was 2 months ago.  Past medical history includes diabetes, Down syndrome, microcephaly, and pacemaker.
MEDICATIONS:  Escitalopram, Allopurinol, Insulin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonic jerks.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal leads and EKG.  The patient had limited wakefulness and most of the study was done in stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedure done were hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The study opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 5 Hz and 20-70 mV.  The background rhythm shows slowing.  There was no frontal central beta rhythm noted. Vertex increases during wakefulness and sharp waves were seen. Sleep stages seen were stage I and stage II. Photic stimulation did not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  The patient had vertex sharp during awake periods.  There was also bi-frontal sharps noted during the study.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse slow waves.
Vertex sharps during awake periods.
Bifrontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Features of diffuse disorganized background with vertex, sharps, and bifrontal sharps with a history of Down syndrome maybe related to encephalopathy.  Clinical correlation recommended.
