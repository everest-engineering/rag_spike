:
History:	60 year old man with an episode concerning for seizure.
Medications:	Keppra, Lopressor, lisinopril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right posterior, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG because of continuous mild-to-moderate focal
slowing in the right posterior quadrant  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
