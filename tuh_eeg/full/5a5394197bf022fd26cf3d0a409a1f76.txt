CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intraoperative monitoring for pulmonary thrombectomy surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Midazolam, fentanyl, vecuronium, propofol, Remodulin, Bumex, Celexa, Viagra, Aldactone, Lovenox, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Intraoperative monitoring was performed in the OR using standard operative montage.  The patient was cooled to 17-18 degrees.  Recording was continued while the patient was rewarmed. This was a 5.5 hour EEG with 3.5 hours MD remote 1:1 supervision
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial hours prior to achievement of suppression, the EEG starts with an anesthetic pattern which was mixed frequency slowing.  Cooling was initiated at 9:50 a.m., but the patient did not achieved a continuously suppressed EEG until 11:00 In the transition to a suppressed pattern, there were intermittent bursts until ultimately the suppressed pattern was achieved.  The surgeon was given the 5-minute notification at 11:00, and confirmatory notice at 11:05.    The overall pattern was symmetrical.
Very slow transients which may represent noncerebral findings were noted at 12:11 p.m.
Rewarming was initiated at 12:41 p.m.  The EEG started to return in a discontinuous fashion at 12:54.  It was relatively symmetric as the EEG pattern returned and the discontinuous pattern resolved.  Recording was terminated at 1323 p.m.
Heart rate 78 to 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this cardiothoracic procedure was remarkable for the ability to achieve a suppressed EEG from 11:00 a.m. until nearly 1:00 p.m. and the EEG rapidly returned with re-warming.
