History:	53 year old woman with history of seizures.
Medications:	Metformin, Lisinopril, Atenolol, Sertraline, Albuterol, Trazodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is noted.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at high frequency flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to occasional left temporal mild-to-
moderate focal slowing. This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in
etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
