CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old, right-handed woman with a history of paranoid schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, hypertension, dementia, and history of metabolic encephalopathy, who presents with episodes of right arm twitching started 7 days ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard International 10-20 System of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This tracing captured wakefulness through drowsiness.  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9 to 9.5 Hz to 40 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  There is presence of low-amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically. Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifacts.  Heart rate was 80-85 beats per minute.  The patient had 2 episodes when her right arm started jerking for less than a minute without any ictal change in the EEG except for muscle artifact.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background in theta activity seen during wakefulness.  There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to toxic, metabolic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  The patient had 2 episodes of right hand jerking during this recording with no EEG correlates or ictal changes, suggestive of these being probably nonepileptic in nature.
