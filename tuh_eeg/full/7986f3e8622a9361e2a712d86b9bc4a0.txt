MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Topamax, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was resumed after a brief hiatus for this individual with refractory epilepsy.  The patient had an aspiration on the morning of 11/11/2012, documented in the dictation section from 11/10/2012 to 11/11/2012.  He was intubated.  This section of the record captures wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the intubation and the use of sedation, there were sections of the record when the patient was awake within alpha rhythm.  Sleep is also captured with vertex waves.  In the initial sections, after the intubation when the patient arrived in the unit, there are some bursts of frontal deltas.  The EEG is overall relatively symmetric.
On the morning of 11/12/2012, the patient is at times drowsy but again with spontaneous arousals.  Brief __________ of sleep with vertex waves were noted.
Heart rate 126 bpm.
INTERVAL IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This section of long-term video EEG monitoring was remarkable for some bursts of frontal slowing immediately following intubation, but overall no seizures were recorded in this section of the record and focal features were resolving.
