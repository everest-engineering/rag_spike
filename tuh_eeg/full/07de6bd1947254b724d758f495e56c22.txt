History:	71 year old woman with a history of narcolepsy since the age of 17.
Medications:	patient could not recall
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a low amplitude fast alpha variant rhythm which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Occasional 50-75uV, 100 msec positive sharp transients occur bilaterally
over the occipital regions of the head during saccadic eye movements with the eyes open.  Diffuse
excess beta activity is noted  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of
sleep) and right RMTD (rhythmic midtemporal theta activity of drowsiness) are noted during sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Alpha variant, fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
