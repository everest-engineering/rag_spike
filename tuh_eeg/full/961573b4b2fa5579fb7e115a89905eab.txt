History:	47 year old woman who was found down.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic up to 9 Hz unstable alpha activity with poor
AP gradient.  The background contains excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Patient rapidly
transitions between wakefulness and drowsiness.  Symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-
complexes are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is nearly continuous T5
electrode artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, electrode, nearly continuous,  T5 electrode artifact
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
background disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  But in this patient, these findings could also be contributed to excessive
drowsiness ( given rapid transitions between wakefulness and drowsiness).  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
