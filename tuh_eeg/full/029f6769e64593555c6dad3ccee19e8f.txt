CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old right handed male with history of epilepsy after being hit by a truck in 2009, was in a coma. Seizures characterized by tightness in the chest and postictal confusion lasting 5 minutes. Last seizure was a month ago.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. The patient drops into stage 1 sleep with rhythmic theta, followed by vertex waves and/or arousals. epochs of stage 2 sleep with spindles are also noted. The patient is asleep during photic stimulation and is in stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
HR: 66-90 pam.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. This EEG was performed in the afternoon in a warm environment, which may explain the individual's sleepiness.
