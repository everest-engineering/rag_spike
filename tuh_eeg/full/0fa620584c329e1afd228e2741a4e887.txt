REASON FOR STUDY:  Followup previous stroke.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman with previous bilateral MCA strokes.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during  wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was temporally frontal and also frontalis muscle artifact throughout the majority of the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a diffusely slow background which has a posterior dominant rhythm that can only be seen over the right hemisphere which reaches, at best, 7 to 8 Hz and appears to be reactive to eye opening.  Overall the EEG reveals a low amplitude recording with some faster frequency seen over the central regions but not well over the temporal regions.  No clear focalities can be seen.  The patient does appear to go into stage I sleep.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
Diffuse attenuation of faster frequency maximal in the temporal regions.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing and attenuation of faster frequencies, more in the temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  In addition, the loss of faster frequencies over the temporal region may be due to the known bilateral strokes.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
