CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old, brought to the emergency room, acting strangely.  History of cardiac disease with pacemaker and smoking.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a bedside portable record without hyperventilation or photic stimulation.  It was generally technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient is quite drowsy, drifting off to sleep or becoming restless.  Both generalized background slowing and shifting slowing were noted, a bit more so on the left than the right.
Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate 102 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.  The slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Arrhythmic delta activity which may be symmetric or demonstrates shifting asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  A toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, they all produce these findings.
