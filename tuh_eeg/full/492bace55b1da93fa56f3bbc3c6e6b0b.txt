HISTORY:
A 54-year-old woman admitted to the hospital past in November 2010, with subdural hematoma. She had an episode of speech arrest, which was thought to have been a seizure. EEG at the time of the head trauma was abnormal in November 2010, but was normal by February 8, 2011.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra, metformin, and metoprolol.
PROCEDURE:
In wakefulness, there is a tender to alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. A breach rhythm is identified within a beta accentuation and an increase in amplitude on the left. This is more apparent in drowsiness and hyperventilation. Hyperventilation and drowsiness elicit occasional, subtle focal slowing in the left frontocentral region.
Photic stimulation elicit vigorous bilateral driving. Heart rate 60 bpm
IMPRESSION:
This is a subtle, but abnormal EEG due to,
1. Infrequent, focal slowing in the left frontocentral region in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
A breach rhythm IS an anticipated finding following craniotomy. No epileptiform features have been seen in any of the EEGs. The presence of the breach rhythm and very focal slowing are anticipated findings following craniotomy.
