CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old woman with epilepsy after concussion 4 years ago.  Seizures may be small or characterized by larger seizures with falling to the floor, loss of consciousness, and convulsive activity.  Previous EEG 4 years ago at Jefferson.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, prednisone, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a routine outpatient 20 minute EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation are technically satisfactory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with vertex waves noted in sleep.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in beta.
Heart rate 60-72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
