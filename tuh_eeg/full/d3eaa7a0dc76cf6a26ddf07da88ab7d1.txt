CLINICAL HISTORY:   65 year old right handed male with a history of head trauma with no bone flap in the right temporal area with complaints of tremor and dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Amlodipine, Atenolol, Donepezil, Folic Acid, Vit. B
REASON FOR STUDY:  Tremor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior and temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep are recorded.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta seen.  Photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharges.  Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T4 continuously at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.  There is an associated breach in that area.
SEIZURES:    None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous right midtemporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of right midtemporal focal serial dysfunction which is consistent with the known craniotomy and lesion in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
