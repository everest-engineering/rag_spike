:
History:	72 year old woman status post recent meningioma resection and stroke, now with
observed left sided twitching and change in mental status.
Medications:	Dilantin and Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Vertex-like waveforms are captured.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Additional underriding fast frequencies are noted over the left frontal
region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.  Episodes of arm shaking are not
captured on this recording.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left frontal
No electrographic seizures
Breach artifact, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable extended 46-minute EEG due to moderate
diffuse slowing and focal continuous moderate left frontal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing
is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  Episodes of arm shaking are not captured on
this recording.  Breach rhythm is secondary to a skull defect.
