MOANING WITH INCONT.AND BOTH BOWL AND URINARY. SZ. STARED IN 3-20`5
STATED BY HIS AUNT. PMHX HTN, NEW ONSET SZ.
Medications:	HEPARIN, SALINE, INSULIN, ASPIRIN, PROTONIX, KEPPRA, NORVASC
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 21hours from 07/09/2015 to 07/10/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
None
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in bilateral the anterior temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At times sharply countoured in the right.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep 21 hour EEG because of continuous focal slowing
in the bilateral anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal dysfunction in this
region, which is non-specific with regards of etiology.
sleep spindles.
