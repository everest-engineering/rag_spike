CLINICAL HISTORY:  Congenital stroke, epilepsy, intermittent spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Tegretol
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Seizure and spike detection software was utilized.  The patient reported feeling panic and impending due, but no clear clinical seizures.  He also felt sometimes as if he was inattentive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  On rare occasions, there is a small amount of theta noted in wakefulness and there is occasional shifting slowing noted on rare occasions in the transition to sleep.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in stage 2 sleep.  No significant slow wave sleep was noted.
The patient reported that he felt as if he slept well, although sleep was somewhat disrupted.
Heart rate 60 to 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the last day of continuous video EEG monitoring and it is remarkable:
No clinical seizures.
No epileptiform features.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the patient.  The patient's bradycardia was not associated with clinical features.  No EEG signature was associated with his feelings of anxiety or panic.
