History:	55 year old man with change in mental status and left sided weakness.
Medications:	Nifedipine, Tylenol, Enalaprilat
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 9 Hz alpha activity
with weak AP gradient.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During sleep, vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-
complexes are noted.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  The EEG technologist notes excessive patient
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Disorganization, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, right frontal
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 27 minute EEG because of mild diffuse slowing and
intermittent focal moderate right frontal slowing.  Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing in the right
frontal region is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin.  Excess beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
