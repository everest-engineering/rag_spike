History:	65 YR OLD  FEMALE WITH PMHX SIG FOR  POSSIBLE CVA. AN ACUTE
NEUROLOGICAL DEFICIT  SPEECH AND EXPRESSIVE APHASIA. NOW WITH ?
NEW ONSET SZ NOTED WITH RT EYE DEV/SHAKING. ADMIN 1 MG ATIVAN 2O
MIN LATER SHAKING STOP/ CONT TO HAVE RT GAZE.
Medications:	HEPARIN, DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, photic
Description:
Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence
of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There was diffuse low voltage beta
activity.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Nearly continuous low voltage polymorphic delta activity was present in the left frontocentral
region (F3-C3 and C3-P3) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There was
bitemporal focal slowing greater on the left side.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and attenuation.  These
findings are consistent with the history of bilateral cerebral infarction.  focal slowing in the left
frontocentral and bitemporal regions.  These findings are  indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. Clinical correlation in
recommended.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
