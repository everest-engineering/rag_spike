History:	UNKNOWN MALE S/P GSW X2 CHEST/FLANK.S/P SURGERIES.   CODED IN
FIELD NO KNOWN INFO.  WITH QUESTIONABLE SZ YESTERDAY.
Medications:	KEPPRA,  FENTANYL DRIP DOSE 50MC /HR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity.  There are some intermixed alpha frequency discharges seen in
the central and frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F2  region with a large field. At times
sharply contoured and occurring periodically every 2-3 seconds.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is no reactivity to visual,
auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the right prefrontal region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin. In addition there is marked  diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
