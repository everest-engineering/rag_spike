CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed male with a history of hypertension and seizures approximately every 3 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Amlodipine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a mildly diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 8 Hz which appears to react to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation includes no abnormal discharges.  During the recording there is some slightly sharp frontal traces seen, but none clearly pathologic.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild diffuse slow wave at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG in wakefulness reveals mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
