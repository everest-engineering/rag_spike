History:	75 year old woman with progressive worsening of mental status.  Patient was found
to have focal seizures in 10/2015, subsequent HIV/ AIDS and TB diagnoses.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of moderate-to-high
amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Broadly based high amplitude triphasic waveforms
are intermittently captured.  Intermittent moderate-to-high amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing
slow waves are captured over the right posterior temporal- parietal region (T6/P4 maximal).  Patient
remains awake throughout the study.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Sharp waves, intermittent, right, post temporal- parietal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable awake-only 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing,
intermittent triphasic waveforms and intermittent right posterior temporal- parietal epileptiform
discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in
hepatic encephalopathy, uremia and anoxia.  There is a potential epileptogenic structural focus
