CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed woman with arteriovenous malformation surgery, currently seizure free but chronic fatigue. Past history of right craniotomy for AVM.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Tricor, ASA, Lexapro.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is some prominent breech rhythm with arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant and a right occipital sharp wave. The field of the focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant is quite generous and there is a clear breech rhythm with sharp waves which can be P6 or O2. Sharply contoured delta is also
observed. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the slowing and prominent sharp waves from the right occipital parietal region. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving on the left.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
2. Right parieto occipital sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies. The epileptiform activity is quite prominent although the patient is seizure-free.
