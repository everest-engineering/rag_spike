History:	62 yo male with a history of grade 1 meningioma status post right middle cranial
fossa resection.
Medications:	Restoril, Keppra, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with
eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  There is expected AP gradient.  It is better formed over
the left.  Sleep architecture consisting of vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes is present.
Sleep architecture is better visualized over the right.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal-
midtemporal- frontocentral region.  Underriding fast activity is present in the same right
temporocentral region.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured, however, activity over the
right frontocentral region is often sharply contoured.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right, anterior temporal- midtemporal-
Breach artifact, right, anterior temporal- midtemporal- frontocentral region
Asymmetry, sleep architecture, better visualized over the right
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 28 minute EEG due to continuous moderate right
anterior temporal- midtemporal- frontocentral region focal slowing. This finding is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  Breach rhythm indicates a skull defect.  Sleep architecture is
better visualized over the right due to a skull defect over that region.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
