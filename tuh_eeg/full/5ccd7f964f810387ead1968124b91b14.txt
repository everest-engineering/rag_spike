CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old woman who presents with an overdose of Lamictal and Benadryl by unknown amounts found by the family walking weird and becoming unresponsive after 20 minutes, intubated in the ED for seizure activity.  The patient has a history of hypertension, depression, and suicidal attempts.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Lorazepam, Lovenox, Famotidine
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  At times there is some theta bursts seen in the central region.  The patient is recorded while unresponsive and no normal sleep architecture is seen.  With stimulation, there appears to be some mild reactivity to the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific as to the etiology.  In this case, it may be due at least in part to medication effect.  The reactivity seen on the EEG carries a favorable prognosis.
