CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with epilepsy, seizure-free since October 2013 and tonic-clonic seizures since 1990.
MEDICATIONS:  Plaquenil, prednisone, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.  It was technically acceptable with impedances under 5 kilo-ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Head rocking artifact and an increase in slowing in the background as well as a small amount of theta were noted in early drowsiness.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in theta.  At the close of hyperventilation, the patient is becoming a bit more drowsy and there are rare asynchronous bursts noted in the transition to drowsiness.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Electroencephalogram within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The features described above are within the range of normal for a subject of this age particularly with a transition to sleep.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat, more prolonged study may be of value.
