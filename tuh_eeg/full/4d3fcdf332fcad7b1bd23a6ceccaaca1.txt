History:	46 year old man status post PEA code, now with episodes concerning for seizures.

Patient sweats, moans and is tense throughout the study.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and
delta activity.  There is continuous sweat, movement, electrode artifact throughout the recording.
Several brief episodes of right arm movements/ shaking do not have a clear ictal correlate.  No
normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of ~120 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG because of abundant sweat, movement and electrode
artifacts. The study is 46 minutes and demonstrates moderate -to-severe diffuse slowing.  This
finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Several brief episodes of right arm movements/ shaking do not have a clear ictal
correlate.  Due to poor quality of the study, subtle epileptiform discharges and ictal runs could have
been missed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~120 bpm.  These findings were
