CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old male with posttraumatic epilepsy, left insular and frontal gliosis, past MVA.  His memory loss of intractable epilepsy and chronic indwelling Foley.
MEDICINES:  Gabapentin and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was utilized with continuous seizure and spike detection software.  This section of the record captures May 7th to May 8th.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  There is a slight amplitude asymmetry and the activity is a little lower amplitude on the right compared to the left.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in sleep and early slow wave sleep was noted.  In drowsiness, there is a suggestion of a bit more slowing on the right relevant to the left.
SEIZURES:  None.
EPILEPTIFORM DETECTIONS:  None.
Heart rate:  50-80 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This last 24 hours of EEG monitoring for this adult was remarkable for:
Asymmetry was somewhat lower amplitude in the right hemisphere particularly right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The amplitude asymmetry is of unclear significance and may be correlated  with this patient's imaging and clinical history.
