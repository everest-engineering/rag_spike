History:	53 year old woman with history of seizures, now presents with more seizures.
Medications:	DILANTIN, TOPAMAX, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of frequencies (alpha,
theta and beta) with underriding delta activity.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  No normal
sleep architecture is present.
Occasional moderate amplitude bilateral occipital sharp waves are present (right>left).  They have
a broad field.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Sharp waves, occasional, bilateral (R>L) occipital
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and occasional bi-
occipital (right>left) epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There is a potentially epileptogenic focus
