CLINICAL HISTORY: 97 year old woman with a shaking spell, eye deviation, head deviation and dementia.
MEDICATIONS: Vesicare, Meclizine, Diovan, ASA, Pravachol,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a bedside portable study. There is no hyperventilation and photic simulation performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and a bit disorganized particularly in the central region but there is a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. As the patient drifts off to sleep, there are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta which are prominent in the frontocentral regions. Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.
HR: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a somewhat disorganized record for age particularly in the initial portions of the record. The later portions are better organized. Contributing factors can include an underlying metabolic process or the patient's underlying dementia. There were no epileptiform features identified.
