CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old male with traumatic brain stem injury, unrestrained driver in MVA hit with multiple objects, subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as other injuries.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Morphine, Famotidine, Tylenol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated in a hard collar.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is comprised of rhythmic mixed theta and delta activity of 2-4Hz activity. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 126 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern primarily delta and then theta
frequency.
2. Absence of reactivity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant disturbance of cerebral function. Correlation with imaging and current doses of medications may be valuable.
