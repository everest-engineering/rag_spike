History:	45 YO MALE TRANSFERRED FROM ST. MARY'S FOR SE. HOSPITAL RECORDS
INDICATE  MULTIPLE SZ'S LASTING A FEW MINUTES TO HOURS.
PMHX:: LENNOX-GASTAUT, VNS, CHRONIC STATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY,
RENAL CALCULI, HYPERSOMNOLENCE, PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, DEPACON, TEGRETOL, ZONISAMIDE, PROPRANOLOL, HEPARIN,
MIDAZOLAM, ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  There are frequent burst of polyspikes in both hemispheres. These are
seen at best at times in the temporal region and central region.  There are burst of 2-3 second of
generalized frontal predominant spike and wave at 2-2.5 Hz.  Multiple frequent seizures were seen.
The begin with a generalized low amplitude beta that slows down in frequency and increase in
amplitude to rhythmic delta. They can last two to three minutes.  Clinically at first he may move his
head to one side the he may later arch his back and lift his arms then suddenly stop.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 60  Patient had episodes of shaking head side to side with no
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, frequent
Spike-and-wave complexes, slow, intermittent
Polyspikes, intermittent
Spikes and sharp waves, intermittent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of multiple seizures with generalized onset as well as
multifocal spikes as well as slow spike and wave complexes. In addition to moderate diffuse slow
waves. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy and
