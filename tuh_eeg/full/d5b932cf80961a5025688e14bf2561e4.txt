CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed female with blackout spells for the last 2 years occurring 1-3 times a year and migraine headaches 2-4 times per week. This is an outpatient EEG.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a low voltage g Hertz posterior dominant rhythm. The patient transitions rapidly into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and posts. Abrupt arousals are noted in and out of stage 2 sleep with at that point a 10 point 7 Hertz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.

HR: 72bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. The transitions in and out of sleep are not necessarily indicative of any sort of pathology and can be seen in somebody who is a light sleeper, sleep deprived or has difficulty consolidating sleep.
