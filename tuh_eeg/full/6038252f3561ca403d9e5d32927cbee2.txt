REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
HISTORY:  A 32-year-old man with anxiety, feels that he could not breathe and lost consciousness, had 3 events of hyperventilation with arms and legs flexing, arched back, responsive during the event, has a history of HIV, anxiety, asthma and hepatitis C.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient is moving frequently throughout the recording and apparently as per the tech there is difficulty placing the electrodes on the patient due to agitation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10-11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is diffuse frontocentral beta seen throughout the recording.  The background reveals this high frequency theta-delta mix frequency discharge at T6 which appears to be mainly artifactual and does not appear to evolve, although sometimes appears slightly suspicious.  Throughout the recording, the patient is moving which makes the evaluation of the recording difficult.  The patient appears to become drowsy but not clearly going to sleep.  Also on the video, he continues his moving and hyperventilating and coughing throughout the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG. The T6 discharge at times appears suspicious but most likely is due to an electrode artifact.  Repeat a recording with some more sedation may be helpful in elucidating and clarifying the diagnosis.  This was discussed with the primary team.
