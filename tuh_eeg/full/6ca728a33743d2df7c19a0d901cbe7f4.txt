Medications:	ATIVAN 1MG.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Benign epileptiform transients of sleep are seen
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral anterior temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal  sharp waves are present
independently in the bilateral anterior temporal region, with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at F7/T3 and F8/T4.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal
BETS (benign epileptiform transients of sleep) or SSS (small sharp spikes)
Sharp waves, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent epileptiform
discharges seen independently in the bilateral anterior temporal region region.  These findings are
indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
