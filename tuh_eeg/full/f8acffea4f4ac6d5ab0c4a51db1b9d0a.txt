CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old man with new-onset seizures. History of head
trauma several days prior to the seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a high amplitude 10.5 to
11 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Early
drowsiness is associated with hypersynchronous slowing. Hyperventilation does not
significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features identified.
There is generous beta and a relatively rapid heart rate in an awake adult. These may
be signs of physical discomfort or anxiety.
