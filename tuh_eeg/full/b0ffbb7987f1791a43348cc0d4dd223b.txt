CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old male status post gunshot wound to left retro-orbital region 15 years ago with ultimate development of epilepsy.  This is a repeat 1 hour EEG in search of epileptiform abnormalities.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was quite somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage with generous beta.  Scant alpha rhythm was identified.  In this low voltage record, in hyperventilation and drowsiness, there is a subtle, low voltage infrequent somewhat irregular, left temporal slowing.  In addition, there are rare bursts of focal slowing from the right temporal region noted following hyperventilation.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves and K complexes, as well as spindles.
Notable findings in this record include a brief burst of slower, rhythmic 3 hertz delta activity from the left temporal region.  This is followed by a single, low voltage, left temporal sharp waves.  These findings are best visualized in an average reference.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation as described above.  Heart rate slightly irregular 90bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
A single, well demarcated burst of rhythmic left temporal slowing.
Very infrequent bursts of shifting lower voltage, temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Only, a single sharp wave was noted in this record.  In this particular clinical context, however, the single sharp waves may be considered as part of this patient's pathology.  No well-defined, higher amplitude spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes were noted.
