CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed woman with cognitive impairment, past
history of epilepsy, sleep disturbance, no tonic clonic seizures, but paroxysms and
sometimes finds herself chewing her tongue. She also has dementia.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Terbutaline, Lovastatin, Lisinopril, Gabapentin, Plavix,
Ibuprofen, HCTZ
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9
Hz posterior dominant rhythm with generous beta activity. Early in drowsiness there is
shifting arrhythmic delta activity noted from either temporal region. They are somewhat
more irregular and sharply contoured on the right compared to the left. Other features of
drowsiness include an increase in theta. There are also some intermittent
hypersynchronous bursts as she becomes drowsy. Photic stimulation elicits a driving
response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional bursts of shifting slowing, greater than expected particularly in the
temporal regions.
2. A bit more irregular sharply contoured slowing in the right mid to posterior temporal
regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in the EEG today.
If additional evaluation for seizures is important, a follow up study recording sleep may
be of value. â€¢
