CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed female with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20  system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a scant amount of 8 Hz activity in the background. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is a small amount of right or left temporal theta. Occasional shifting slowing in the temporal regions is noted as the patient transition toward sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Minimal excess temporal theta for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. The theta described above is a nonspecific finding but can be seen in the context of underlying cerebrovascular disease .
