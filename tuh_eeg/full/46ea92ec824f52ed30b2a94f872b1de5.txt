CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed female with a history of a brain tumor at the age of 9, which was excised.  She describes episodes of staring.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Keppra, Levoxyl.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz that is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produces nice photic driving.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at F8/T4.  At one point there was one sharp transient seen over F7/T3, but not clearly epileptiform.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F8/T4 at times in a polymorphic manner consistent with temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known tumor history and surgery.  No seizures were seen.
