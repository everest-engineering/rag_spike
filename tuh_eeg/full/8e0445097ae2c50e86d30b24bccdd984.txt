TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a nice amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  72, regular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
