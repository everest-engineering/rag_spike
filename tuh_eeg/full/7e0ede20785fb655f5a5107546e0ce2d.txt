CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old adult with new-onset seizures, COPD, diabetic retinopathy, asthma, renal insufficiency.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Synthroid, lisinopril, atorvastatin.  Others, Avastin.
INTRODUCTION:  Twenty-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is a primarily drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow, poorly organized, and includes a mixture of theta and delta.  There are bursts of rhythmic bihemispheric delta.  Shifting slowing was noted, left greater than right.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in slowing.
Brief sleep include spindles.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter.  A toxic or metabolic process may play a role.  The shifting slowing, left greater than right may be correlated with imaging.
