DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is in stage 2 sleep. There is generous beta. In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 microvolts. Without stimulation she drifts back to sleep and hyperventilation is consequently not performed. The majority of the record includes generous stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, POSTS, and spindles. The patient Is awakened for photic stimulation. There is a driving response, but again she is struggling to stay awake during photic stimulation.

HR: 72 bpm
