History:		77 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SYNCOPE WITH FALLS. PT FOUND DOWN AT HOME.
Medications: None
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present but at best recede 7Hz. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No sleep recorded.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
