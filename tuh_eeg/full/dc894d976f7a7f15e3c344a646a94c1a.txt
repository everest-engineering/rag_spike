CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old male, found down with right sided weakness.
Multiple previous strokes.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin. Lisinopril, Lovenox, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The waking background is remarkable for
significantly more muscle artifact on the right than the left. In maximal wakefulness,
there is a glimpse of a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There is excess theta from
both hemispheres and occasional subtle underlying 2 hertz delta in the left hemisphere
particularly central temporarily. The patient has an episode of facial tremor. This 25
second burst is characterized by muscle artifact and no epileptiform features. Slight
tremor is seen on other occasions. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in
slowing.
HR: 120 bpm and irregular
Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Modest background slowing and disorganization identified bilaterally.
2. Subtle underlying focal delta from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow up study in the lab may be considered.
