CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old male with right parietal metastasis, s/p resection in 2014. Brought in after found shaking left arm and leg. Patient complains of headache and vomiting.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra, Decadron, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was lethargic.  He was able to move his right leg.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is diffusely slow with excess theta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity as well as some bursts of rhythmic delta.  Discrete sharp waves are noted from the right central parietal region, typically maximum at P4, but with variable maximum.  The vast majority of the sharp waves are maximum at P4 and then C4, but some of them are negative at P4.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in motor activity.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to,
Right centroparietal sharp waves, frequent at times almost periodic.
Right-sided focal slowing.
Background slowing and disorganization.
Occasional rhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings appear to be in the region of this patient's known cerebral metastasis.  No seizures were recorded.  If the mental status does not match the clinical picture, consideration for a long-term monitoring study is appropriate.
