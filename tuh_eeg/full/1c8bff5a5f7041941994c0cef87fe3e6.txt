CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 48-year-old, handicapped woman admitted in status epilepticus with a very abnormal EEG on 1/31/06.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, insulin, Phenobarbital, and others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitored is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. There are no clinical notations noted.
CLINICAL NOTES: During this portion of the record, there are clinical notes.  There is no indication given that this patient was thought to have had clinical seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial portions of the record, there are prominent, almost continuous trains of left temporal sharp waves or sharp waves through the left hemisphere maximum in that region.  By 4:00 AM, the epileptiform activity is not quite as sharply contoured and there are portions of the record in which there is theta on the left, but no ongoing sharp waves.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This continuous video EEG monitoring session is remarkable for:
Attenuation or a dampening of the sharp waves from the left hemisphere without quite as much in terms of the constant train of sharp waves, but still with sharply contoured activity from the left temporal region â€“ even in the last few minutes of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports an ongoing, highly irritative focus.  Additional clinical correlation would be necessary to determine if this is a prolonged postictal recording, or a chronic pattern for this patient.
