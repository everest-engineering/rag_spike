History:	52 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  CHECK UP.  PER DAUGHTER PT HAS
NOCTURNAL SEIZURES ONCE IN WHILE.
Medications:	TEGRETOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid to anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep 1 hour EEG because of intermittent focal slowing
in the left anterior temporal and mid temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
