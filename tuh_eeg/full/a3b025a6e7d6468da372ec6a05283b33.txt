CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed gentleman with new onset seizures 3-4 weeks ago, the last seizure was a tonic clonic seizure 1 week ago. Recent positive PPD.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a 9. 7 Hz alpha rhythm. There is an asymmetry with a bit of rhythmic mixed theta delta from the right temporal region, as well as disruption in the right occipital region. In the transition in and out of drowsiness, these focal features are accentuated. Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. There are other sections of the record with brief Epochs of stage 1 sleep, which are a little bit more symmetric. There are also some sections with a little bit more right anterior temporal rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits driving, which is somewhat better developed on the left.
HR: 60 bpm, slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the right temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were seen. The characteristics of the focal slowing are typical of temporal lobe epilepsy.
