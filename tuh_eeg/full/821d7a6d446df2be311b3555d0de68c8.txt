CLINICAL HISTORY:  31 year old female with history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal, single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient reaches stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  However, during hyperventilation there is a marked abnormal response which I will describe below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During hyperventilation, the patient develops a nicely well-formed polymorphic delta seen at F8/T2 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts and at times with some intermixed sharply contoured activity not clearly productive formed, but suspicious.  This was only seen throughout hyperventilation again.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region accentuated by hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
