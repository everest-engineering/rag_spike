CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman, status post coiling of left ACom aneurysm with impaired mental status, intubated in the ICU.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Neo-Synephrine.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were noted.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG has a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of theta and delta.  Although, it may be difficult for bedside examiners to identify changes in state, the patient clearly has some wakefulness with eye opening.  Superimposed focal slowing is characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right.  Sleep state  included increase in bilateral slowing.

Heart rate 100 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  The second day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing from the left.
