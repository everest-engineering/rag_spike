CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old right handed male with epilepsy with simple partial
seizures characterized by right arm shaking. The patient reports an aura before all
seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standardÂ·10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This Is an outpatient EEG. This is an awake and asleep
record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta and a small amount of background
theta. Vertex waves are identified In stage I sleep. Photic stimulation does not activate
the record. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
There is a scant amount of head rocking artifact noted in the EEG.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background theta can be seen with the use of
carbamazepine. No epileptiform features were noted in this EEG. None were seen in the 2007 EEG as well.
