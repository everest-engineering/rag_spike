History:	76 year old man with a recent stroke.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right hemisphere.
The background over the left consists of 8-9 Hz activity posteriorly, excess theta activity and weak
AP gradient.  The background over the right lacks PDR and consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude theta and delta activity with delta activity most pronounced over the right temporal
region.  During very brief fragmented periods of quiescence, diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms are
seen, they are better formed over the left.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
irregular heart rate with frequent up to 1.5 sec inter-QRS pauses.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, moderate, right hemispheric, especially over the temporal region
Cardiac arrhythmia, up to 1.5 sec inter-QRS pauses
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable awake and very briefly asleep  22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse
slowing and continuous focal moderate right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the
temporal region. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate with frequent up to 1.5 sec inter-QRS
