CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 22-year-old male, who developed epilepsy at age 14.  Mother reports 2 seizures, 1 at home and 1 at the Frankford emergency room, requiring transferred to Temple yesterday.  The patient is still somewhat postictal.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was initially relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate a somewhat slow and disorganized pattern.  With stimulation, the patient alerts with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and then drifts off to a drowsy pattern with an increase in background theta.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent excess theta noted in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The intermittent background slowing is a nonspecific finding and may be part of this patient's postictal state.  Previous EEGs were not available today for comparison.
