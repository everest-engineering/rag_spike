:
History:	78 YEAR OLD MALE EVALUATED FOR SEIZURES. HX OF DIABETES,
HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERLIPIDEMIA
Medications:	GLUCOTROL, LEVOTHYROID, FORTAMET, ASPIRIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
