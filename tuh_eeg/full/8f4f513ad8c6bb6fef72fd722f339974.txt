CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman with recurrent syncope over the past 6 years. Multiple episodes where she feels drunk. The patient has a pacemaker and asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Midodrine, Celexa, Seroquel, Klonopin, Zoloft, Albuterol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes generous, low voltage frontocentral beta activity and a 10 hertz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness includes background theta. This is overall, a relatively low voltage record with scant alpha rhythm and generous beta. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic theta with vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. Hyperventilation does not clearly activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A low voltage pattern with generous beta is not pathological. Scant alpha rhythm is also not pathological. The generous beta and the appearance of theta early on in drowsiness may also be related to this patient's medications. This is this patient's second normal EEG.
