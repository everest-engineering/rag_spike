CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old gentleman with previous cranial surgery and resection of scar for mass in April 2012 in the right frontocentral region.  No recent seizures reported.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, frontocentral beta.  Mu prominent breech rhythm is noted in the right frontocentral region with accentuation of beta frequency in that area with beta frequency activity reaching 65 microvolts.  The beta activity is often at 14 and 20 Hz.
Features of drowsiness including increase in beta, followed by rhythmic, frontocentral theta.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This electroencephalogram is remarkable for a prominent breech rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A breech rhythm with prominent accentuation of beta activity is an anticipated finding following craniotomy and may be accentuated by the use of phenobarbital.
