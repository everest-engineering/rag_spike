History:	37 year old woman with a history of new seizure onset with 2 seizures in 6/2014.
Patient also has a history of headaches and opioid use/ abuse.
Medications:	KEPPRA, NEURONTIN, SUBOXONE, ATENOLOL, FIORICET
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast and slow alpha rhythm is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV,
5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
complexes appear.  Patient transitions rapidly into drowsiness and sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Sleep, stage 2
Alpha variant, fast
Alpha variant, slow
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 41-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this
patient could be related to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
