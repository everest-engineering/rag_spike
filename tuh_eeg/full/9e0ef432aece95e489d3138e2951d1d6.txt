Length of the recording was 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 62yo man with a history of Lung Cancer, S/P Resection, TIA, ITP, with recent TIA vs CPS
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, aspirin, hydroxyurea, Prilosec, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  This AP gradient is better formed over the right hemisphere.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates. There is continuous polymorphic, often sharply contoured, theta and delta activity captured over the left hemisphere.  This slowing is most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Additionally, the amplitude is higher over the left temporal region.  Also, faster frequencies are observed over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Continuous mild-to-moderate left temporal slowing
A breach over the left temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to continuous mild-to-moderate left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Breach artifact is secondary to a skull defect.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
