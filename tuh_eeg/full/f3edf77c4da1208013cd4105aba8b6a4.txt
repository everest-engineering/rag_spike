DATE OF STUDY:  November 22 to November 23, 2011.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed on the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Continuous seizure and spike detection is utilized.  There is no clinical information provided in the record and there is no medication up date.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with generous beta particularly in the frontal regions.  There are sections with a discontinuous pattern, particularly at 7:00 p.m.  There are bursts of sharply contoured activity in the left frontal region or sharp waves, and some of these occur even out of the burst suppression pattern.  It appears that pharmacotherapy might have been changed at 7:00 p.m. on the night of November 22, because there is intermittently a burst suppression pattern and an increase in epileptiform activity.
By 2:17 a.m. the background EEG is more continuous and it is more of a theta pattern.  There are also sections of the record, including at 2:00 a.m. where the camera is moved to the door and the EEG electrodes on the left are compromised.
This section ends at 8:03 a.m. and at this point the patient is not seizing, but there is a prominent focus with left frontal sharp waves.  Heart rate N/A.
