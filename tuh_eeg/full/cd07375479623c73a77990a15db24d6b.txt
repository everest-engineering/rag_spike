History:	24 year woman with a history of seizures since childhood.  No reported seizures for
many years.
Medications:	lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of 14-14.5 Hz activity posteriorly that attenuates with eye
opening.  Slow alpha variant is occasionally seen.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
slow waves appear diffusely.
Five brief (0.2-0.5 sec) bursts of generalized frontally predominant polyspikes are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Polyspikes, few generalized, frontally predominant, 0.2-0.5 sec in duration
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG due to presence of several brief bursts of
generalized frontally predominant polyspikes. Background activity is otherwise normal.  These
findings are suggestive of a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
