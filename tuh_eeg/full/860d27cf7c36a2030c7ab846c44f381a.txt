CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right handed woman with history of epilepsy which she attributes to her head trauma.  Previous tonic clonic seizures usually proceeded by a warning.  She has not had a tonic clonic seizure for 5 years until she received Flexeril which caused an episode without warning with vocalization, followed by stiffening.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Doxycycline, Clonazepam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This an awake and stage II sleep record and the patient seems quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and POSTS with spindles and K-complexes observed in stage II sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta in the background. Notable in this EEG are isolated bursts of frontally predominant spike and wave activity with generalized paroxysmal fast activity preceding the bursts.  The first burst is less than 2 seconds in duration, occurring as the patient transitions in and out of sleep. Photic stimulation is performed at the end of the EEG as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.  In some cases photic stimulation also appears to elicit brief bursts of similar activity, but there was one burst that occurred just prior to the photic stimulation.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spike and wave activity.
Paroxysmal fast activity preceding some of these discharges.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are most compatible with a generalized mechanism for seizures.  They were not seen in her most recent EEG.
