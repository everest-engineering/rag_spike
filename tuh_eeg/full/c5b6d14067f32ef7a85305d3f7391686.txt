CLINICAL HISTORY:   59 year old woman with past history of aneurysm and stroke, seizures August 10, 2010, headaches now with left-sided weakness, dizziness, aphasia, and a 10-minute episode of slurred speech and aphesis.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is awake and alert.  She is able to follow commands.  She has involuntary eye blinking. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive. There are intermittent episodes with involuntary eye blink.  These are associated with eye blink artifact, but also with drop out a faster frequency activity in the right frontotemporal region.  There are rare sharp waves noted at T4/F8 in the background.  On 3 occasions with rhythmic eye blinking, there seems to be more of a disruption fracture frequency activity and movement the right central temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits driving.  After photic stimulation, one of these bursts is noted with arrhythmic initially 5 Hz pattern, but with frequency of evolution, 2 mg of versed reduced the right frontal rhythmic discharges
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An unusual discharge in a frontal regions, complicated by blink artifact, but associated with drop out a faster frequency activity.  This discharge has some bilateral representation and has seen on 5 occasions in this 1 hour EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings were discussed with the team.  Additional EEG recording capturing sleep was suggested to characterize this pattern.
