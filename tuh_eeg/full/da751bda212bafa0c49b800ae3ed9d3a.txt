History:	52 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SZ (SZ FREE 19 YRS.),  MIGRAINES, TIA.
PRESENTS WITH BREAKTHROUGH SZ ON 9/16/13 W/LOC AND POSTICTAL
CONFUSION. PT HAD EEG THAT DY W/PHOTIC FEELS IT WAS DO TO PHOTIC.
Medications:	Lamictal
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Alpha rhythm and background activity are low voltage (10-25uV), but show normal reactivity to eye
opening and attenuate with drowsiness.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. This is at time sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
