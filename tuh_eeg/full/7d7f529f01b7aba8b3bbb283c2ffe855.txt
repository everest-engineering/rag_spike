LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS: Folic Acid, Phenytoin, Multivit
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9-1/2 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Sleep architecture is better formed over the left hemispheric leads.  Two isolated sharp waves with after-going waves were observed over the right temporal region with phase reversal over the T4 electrode.  Both sharp waves are observed during sleep.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:  Two sharp waves with after-going waves seen over the right midtemporal region with phase reversal over the T4 electrode.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 24-minute EEG due to rare right midtemporal epileptiform discharges.  This finding indicates likely an underlying structural pathology with epileptogenic  potential.
