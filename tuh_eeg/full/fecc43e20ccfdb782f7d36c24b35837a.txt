History:	69 YR MALE RIGHT FACIAL WEAK, SLURRED SPEECH.   PMHX: HTN, AFIB, S/P
CABG, CHF, RHEUMATIC HEART DS, RIGHT RENAL CELL CARCINOMA S/P
NEPHRECTOMY
Medications:	NO SEDATION NO SZS MEDS
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV alpha rhythm reaching 9Hz at best, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is a short sleep latency.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage
2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 66 and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The short sleep latency is a nonspecific
finding and if clinically indicated, a sleep study is suggested.
