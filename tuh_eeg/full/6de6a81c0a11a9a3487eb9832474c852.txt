CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed male with epilepsy, sepsis, pneumonia, depression, anorexia, chronic nursing home resident. Past history of childhood epilepsy and C-spine injury.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Acetaminophen, Avodart, Baclofen, Citracal, Depakote, Lasix, Niaspan

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed. The patient is recorded in a somewhat stiff position. Wakefulness and sleep are identified.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes limited wakefulness but in wakefulness there is a low voltage, 10 Hertz alpha rhythm. Much of the record includes drowsiness with at times rhythmic slowing from the left frontocentral region in wakefulness. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic bilateral slowing and then some vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic left frontotemporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activity is less prominent in this EEG than seen in previous but previous EEGs have identified a left temporal focus with the characteristic rhythmic temporal slowing described above. Other studies identified sharp waves.
