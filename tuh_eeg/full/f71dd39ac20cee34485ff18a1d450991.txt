CLINICAL HISTORY: 92 year old woman status post subdural hematoma evacuation with craniectomy, multiple drains, previous right arm twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has no clinical events noted this morning. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.   DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates intermittent bursts of high amplitude right temporal sharp waves with a generous field of spread which are occurring in the region of the craniotomy. The brief bursts are observed by the technologist at the bedside and are not associated with clinical change. In addition, there are increasing sections of the record with a well-defined 6 Hz and 8 Hz activity. Stimulation of the patient does seem to produce an increase in faster frequency activity followed briefly by the sharp waves from the right.
HR: 60 to 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent bursts of sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
2. Background slowing which is improving.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The bursts of sharp waves are not associated with clinical change in the patient. In addition, the overall background is improving. Addition clinical evaluation may be important.
