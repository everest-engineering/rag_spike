CLINICAL HISTORY: 81 year old woman, status post code 2 days prior to this EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Captopril, Depacon,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: P..s the tracing continues, the patient has eye flutter.
Aside from this the background EEG is markedly suppressed. There is some muscle
artifact. Small, discreet, low voltage islands of 12.7 Hz activity appear to be identified in
the frontal regions. These are reviewed with spectral analysis of the data. They are also
compared to the muscle artifact that occurs on the right.
HR:. 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly suppressed background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral
function, particularly important 48-hours post cardiac arrest.
