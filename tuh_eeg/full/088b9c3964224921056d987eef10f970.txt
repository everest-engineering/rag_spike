History:	28 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Seizures stopped ~ 8 years ago and
patient stopped her AEDs.  Seizures now recurred: she has experienced ~3 seizures
in the last 3 weeks.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple lash rates.  There is frequent eye flutter artifact.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, other, eye flutter
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. There is frequent eye flutter artifact, so subtle anterior
abnormalities might have been missed.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
