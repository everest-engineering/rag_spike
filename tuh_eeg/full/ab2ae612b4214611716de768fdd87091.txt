TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta activity is seen.  The patient goes into stage 1, stage 2 sleep.  Activity and procedures with photic stimulation and hypoventilation reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.  There are some short bursts of theta wave forms seen, at times more prominent in the parietal lobe.  The morphology appears to be benign.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG awake and sleep.
