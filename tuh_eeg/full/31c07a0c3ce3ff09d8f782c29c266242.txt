REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old man with a history of seizures for 4 years described as loss of consciousness with tongue biting but no bowel or bladder incontinence, and an aura.  The last seizure was a month ago.  He also has a history of seizures in the family.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5-9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Occasional focal slow waves seen at F7/T3, one appeared to be sharply contoured.
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
HEART RATE:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing and mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region as well as mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
