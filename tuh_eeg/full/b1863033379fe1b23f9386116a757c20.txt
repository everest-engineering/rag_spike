History:	25 year old man with AIDS and cerebral toxoplasmosis.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low-to-
moderate voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are
present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag
and resolve during drowsiness.  No normal sleep architecture is present but periods of quiescence
are present and characterized by increase in diffuse polymorphic theta activity.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Triphasic waves, intermittent
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24 minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse
background slowing and triphasic waveforms. These findings are indicative of a moderate-to-severe
diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
Triphasic waves are a nonspecific EEG finding that can be seen in hepatic encephalopathy,
