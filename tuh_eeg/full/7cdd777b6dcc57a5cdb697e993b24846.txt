CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old woman with multiple abdominal pathologies, open abdomen, multiple chest tubes. The patient had an event yesterday with head turning and alteration of awareness. The patient remains intubated, somewhat responsive, eyes now midline, but moving the left arm a bit more sluggishly than the right. Sepsis, unresponsiveness.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Vancomycin, Cefepime, Antifungal

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of rhythmic background theta with shifting arrhythmic delta activity. Intermittently there is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity on the right compared to the left. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster state theta frequency activity.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features described above are relatively subtle this bedside recording pathology. The presence of reactivity to tactile stimulation is a positive prognostic feature. No epileptiform features were noted.
