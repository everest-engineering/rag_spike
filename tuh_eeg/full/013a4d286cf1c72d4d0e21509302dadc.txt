HISTORY:  A 57-year-old woman status post epilepsy surgery 2003, was seizure free, but seizures recurred last year with daily auras with white visual phenomenon, then falling and loss of consciousness.  The patient had a confusional episode on April 11.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.   Impedances were checked and were very good initially.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG demonstrates a well-organized pattern from the left with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  As the recording continues, there is both an artifact noted at the F8 electrode in the region of the patient's craniotomy, but also focal slowing   with disruption of faster frequency activity, right frontotemporal focal slowing with mixture of theta and delta and then of course electrode artifact.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate both the electrode artifact and the focal slowing on the right.  Features of drowsiness include bursts of rhythmic 1-2 at the delta and the right frontotemporal region.  Some of this is sharply contoured and higher amplitude, compatible with breach rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontotemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is supportive of structural or functional abnormality on the right congruent with the previous right temporal lobectomy.  No
sharp waves were seen.  Arrangements will be made for this patient to be seen in the clinic as she is not on seizure medicine and appears to be experiencing seizures.
