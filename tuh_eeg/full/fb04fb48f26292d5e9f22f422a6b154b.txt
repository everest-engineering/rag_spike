History:	44 YR MALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  PT STATES HAS ABOUT 3 SZS A
MONTH. NO CHANGE IN CHARACTER. LAST SZ 2 WKS AGO.  PT STATES HE
JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
Medications:	Tegretol, Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior
region, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
