History:	61 YEAR OLD MALE WITH SPELLS OF LEFT ARM AND LEG WEAKNESS, RIGHT
VISUAL SYMPTOMS
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  The stent was employed in right carotid artery with no associated EEG
changes.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Occasional theta activity is present in the right temporal (T6) region during wakefulness.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
, uneventful EEG during carotid stenting
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, right
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful EEG during cerebral angiogram and right carotid stent placement. There is
evidence of occasional right temporal slowing consistent with focal dysfunction in this region.
