AGE: 76 y.o.
SEX: female
START DATE OF STUDY: 11/18/2015 at 5:00PM
END DATE OF STUDY: 11/19/2015 at 6:00AM
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU EEG TYPE: , video LTM
EEG #: 15-328
HISTORY:
76 y.o. female with a history of altered mental status referred for EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
gabapentin (NEURONTIN) 600 mg tablet, Take 600 mg by mouth 3 times daily.
diltiazem (CARDIZEM CD) 240 mg 24 hr capsule, Take 240 mg by mouth daily.
nitroglycerin (NITRODUR) 0.6 mg/hr, Place 1 patch onto the skin daily.
omeprazole (PRILOSEC) 40 mg capsule, Take 40 mg by mouth daily. warfarin (COUMADIN) 3 mg tablet, Take 3 mg by mouth daily.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit. SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as well as extensive random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed.
DAY 1 (11/18/215, 5:00PM - 11/19/2015, 06:00AM) BACKGROUND:
The waking background is disorganized with diffuse theta and delta slowing.
Posterior dominant rhythm was present intermittently at 8Hz. The background is highly variable.
There were no persistent asymmetries in amplitude and frequency.
Sleep was characterized by normal sleep transients, with rare symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
Sharply contoured activity with a triphasic morphology were seen over the frontal leads. There was a characteristic "front to back" lag seen.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Disorganized background due to frontally predominant triphasic
waves
Diffuse theta and delta slowing
No clinical or electrographic seizures
These results were communicated to the primary team.
DAY 2 (11/19/2015, 06:00A - 11/20/2015, 06:00A)
BACKGROUND: No change
GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change, background is diffusely slow. FOCAL SLOWING: None
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):	Intermittent, sharply contoured frontal triphasic waves.
SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single EKG lead captured normal sinus rhythm.
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Disorganized background due to frontally predominant triphasic waves.
Diffuse theta and delta slowing
