REASON FOR STUDY:  Brain death.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old man found down with large left subdural.  EEG for brain death.

MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor, Keppra, famotidine, Tylenol.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG with electrocerebral sinus montage was done using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode and EMG electrode.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the recording there appears to be an EKG and pulse artifact continuously.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an absent posterior dominant rhythm and an absent normal frontal central beta.  There is no normal background frequencies.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  No activating procedures were performed.

Abnormal discharges:  There is an absence of normal electrocerebral activity throughout the recording which is diffusely suppressed with an overlying pules and an electrocardiographic artifact.

Seizures:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to the absence of normal electrocerebral activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG does not reveal any clear electrocerebral activity.  However, no definite conclusions can be made about brain death due to the cardiac and pulse artifact seen throughout the recording.  These findings were communicated at 4:00 p.m. to the primary team.
