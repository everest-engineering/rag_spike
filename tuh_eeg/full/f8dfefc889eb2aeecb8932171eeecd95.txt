CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old male with progressive right hemispheric infarct, change in mental status, eye deviation and likely seizure on the 27th.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed drip, phenytoin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with seizure and spike detection.  This is a technically acceptable record.  CT compatible electrodes were used and intermittent bedside testing of various natures were performed on the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous, low-voltage pattern.  The overall pattern is quite suppressed on the right relative to the left.  The left hemisphere has a bit more theta in comparison to the right.  There are some triangular-shaped occipital waveforms and on one occasion a single left occipital triangular-shaped sharp wave.
In the later sections of the record on the 28th, the EEG is higher amplitude on the left with a bit more vigorous, mixed frequency pattern with a mixture of theta and delta on the left.
Interictal sharp waves:  Rare occipital triangular-shaped waveforms with a left occipital maximum.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  The first 24 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring is remarkable for:
A very low voltage pattern.
An overall suppressed brain pattern, improving somewhat at the end of the first 24 hours.
The absence of seizures.
Paucity of sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of brain function, more significantly impacting the right hemisphere than the left.  No seizures were recorded.
