CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old right handed female with involuntary movements,
narcolepsy, evaluate for possible seizure disorder. The patient stays up all night on the
computer but then has episodes of myoclonus while awake.
MEDICATIONS: Provigil, Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient appears to be quite drowsy with
generous beta and a 1 0 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the
record. It produces a small amount of slowing. There are some technical issues with
suboptimal right occipital temporal electrode placement. Immediately after
hyperventilation, the patient falls asleep with vertex waves. The patient drifts off into
stage II sleep. A muscle monitor was not employed during this EEG. She Is awakened
for photic stimulation. She seems to be restless during photic stimulation but there is a
driving response. She also drifts back into stage II sleep during photic stimulation.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. This patient's
myoclonus was not recorded. Total sleep time for this EEG was only 12 minutes. A
followup, 1 hour EEG should be performed with a muscle twitch monitor to assess for
myoclonus as well as to determine whether or not there are unusual sleep epochs
captured in a routine EEG. If additional information is needed, please consider a polysomnogram.
