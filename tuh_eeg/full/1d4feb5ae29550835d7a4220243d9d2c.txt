CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 50-year-old gentleman with history of diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, glaucoma, heart block, who presents with left-sided headache and dizziness.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, Coreg, insulin, fluticasone, pantoprazole, Klonopin, Diovan, metformin, Xanax, pravastatin and Senokot.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 8.5-9 Hz in frequency at 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta-activity which is distributed symmetrically.  There are occasional bursts of bitemporal slowing at F7/T3 and F8/T4 lasting for 1 second.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies, and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness due to bitemporal slowing.  No epileptiform activities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Bitemporal slowing is suggestive of bilateral structural abnormalities or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.
