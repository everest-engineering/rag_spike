History:	77 year old woman status post recent tPA, now with episodes concerning for
Medications:	Valproic Acid
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The
background over the left consists of polymorphic 9 Hz alpha activity, weak AP gradient and excess
theta.  There is no clear PDR or AP gradient over the right hemisphere.  The background over the
right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude theta and delta
activity and intermittent right anterior temporal- frontocentral  sharp waves.  Maximal scalp
negativity occurs over F8/T2 and, to a lesser degree, F4/C4 electrodes.  Sharp waves are more
prominent during drowsiness.  Drowsiness is characterized by decrease in EMG artifact, fragmented
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EKG artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right hemispheric
Sharp waves, intermittent, right temporal, anterior, primarily over F8/T2 leads
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy portable 23-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing,
moderate continuous right hemispheric slowing and intermittent right anterior temporal
epileptiform discharges that increase in frequency during drowsiness. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and
intermittent epileptiform discharges are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal structural
lesion over the right hemisphere and, especially, over the anterior temporal region.
