CLINICAL HISTORY:
The patient is a 29-year-old lady with new onset seizures of one-month duration. Last seizure was last week that lasted
three minutes, characterized by left-sided body and face twitching that lasted for four to five minutes and post ictal confusion
with a tight feeling in the head.
Has a history of migraines and ??cyst in the head.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
None.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
This is an awake and drowsy record. Wakefulness is characterized by low voltage but symmetric and react i-.e alpha of 10
Hz. There is a lot of beta and also muscle artifact as the patient was tense. Hyperventilation was characterized by slowing
and an increase in the amplitude. During wakefulness and stage I sleep, this is a normal record with occasional vertex waves
and occasional spindles. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not activate the record.
IMPRESSION:
Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is a clinical consideration, please consider
Sleep deprived EEG or EEG recording of longer duration to capture epileptiform activity.
