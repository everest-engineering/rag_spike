Medications:	OXCARBAZEPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
