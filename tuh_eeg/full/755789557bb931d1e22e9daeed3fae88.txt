History:	69 year old woman with a known metastatic cancer to the brain (left basal ganglia),
now presents with increase in mental status.
Medications:	Keppra, Dexa
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic 8-9 Hz activity.  The
AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is captured.  Patient remains awake
throughout the recording.
Intermittent brief bursts of rhythmic bitemporal somewhat synchronous delta activity are seen over
the bitemporal regions.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, bilateral temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute portable EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
intermittent bilateral TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity). Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  TIRDA indicates
an increased epileptogenic potential over the bitemporal regions and is equivalent to epileptiform
