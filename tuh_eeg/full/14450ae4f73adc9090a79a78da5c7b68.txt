CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 26-year-old male with TIA, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, asthma, and HIV disease with recurrent episodes of dizziness, euphoria, palpitations, and tachycardia.  Loss of equilibrium for 15-20 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Prezista, Truvada, others.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Infrequently in wakefulness and somewhat more prominently in drowsiness, there is an intra-hemispheric asymmetry characterized by a slight disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere, particularly central temporal region and a small amount of slightly irregular mixed theta-delta.  It is a bit more prominent in drowsiness.  Other features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic theta.
Hyperventilation was remarkable for a fair amount of artifact, but no significant focal features.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate irregular, 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for intermittent, somewhat subtle left temporal focal slowing with somewhat irregular mixed theta-delta and slight disruption of faster frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No Epileptiform features were noted.  This EEG may be correlated with history and exam for this individual with heart disease.
