CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and epilepsy, admitted with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, Celexa, Percocet, Topamax, Ativan, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient appeared to be a bit uncomfortable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The overall background is somewhat disorganized and the patient appears to be somewhat uncomfortable.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Photic stimulation was remarkable primarily for a photoelectric artifact, but there was a driving response.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to mild background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The mild disorganization is a nonspecific finding and may be part of this patient's classical metabolic encephalopathy or due to other diffuse
disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were seen.  No previous EEGs were available at this time for comparison.
