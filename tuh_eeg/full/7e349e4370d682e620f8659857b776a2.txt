History:	30 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF NEW ONSET SZ. 1WK AGO.FELT NAUSEOUS ALL DY. FELL BACK BED AND GTC/WITH TONGUE BITE, POST ICTAL CONFUSION. MOM WITH SEIZURES 2' BRAIN TUMOR.  PMHX: DEPRESSION. PT STATES HAD BEEN STRESSED AND NOT SLEEPING
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
PROZAC
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. There is mild disorganization at times.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic,excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background stowing. This finding is indicative of mild  diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
