History: 54 YR OLD MAN. PRESENTS WITH H/0 ETOH ABUSE FOUND DOWN, ASYSTOLE TOV-FIB SHOCKED AND INTUBATED IN FIELD. PMHX SIG FOR ETOH/DRUG ABUSE. BIPOLAR
Sedation: none

EEG Type:
Routine, awake & drowsy

Technique: international 10-20 system, standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes

Description
There is a diffuse burst suppression pattern characterized by sever amplitude suppression with bursts of high amplitude generalized sharp waves.  There is also intermittent rhythmic muscle artifact suggestive of myoclonus.  There is no normal background activity.  There is no normal sleep activity.    No focal abnormalities. Bursts of high amplitude sharp waves are seen in the frontocentral regions.  There is no response to activation procedures.

Summary of findings:
Burst suppression pattern, intermittent.
Sharp waves, bilateral frontal

Interpretation:
This is a markedly abnormal EEG exhibiting attenuation and a burst suppression activity.  The repetitive bursts of muscle activity likely correspond to myoclonic jerks seen in this patient.  The patient will be connected to long term EEG monitoring for further evaluation.
