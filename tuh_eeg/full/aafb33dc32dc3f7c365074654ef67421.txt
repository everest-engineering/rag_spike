History:	20 year old woman with a progressive decline in mental status.
Medications:	Vancomycin, Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
This is a technically limited EEG due to nearly constant eye movement that results in large
amplitude anterior artifact.  With eyes closed, the background consists of low-to-moderate
amplitude fast activity, poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic low amplitude theta and delta
activity.  With eyes opened, the background voltages are low and the background consists of a
mixture of excess beta, theta and delta activity.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz
activity is also seen.  Patient remain awake throughout the recording.
No appreciable focal features are captured.  No clear epileptiform discharges are seen.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the ___
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
