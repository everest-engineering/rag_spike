History:	35 year old man with a history of seizures since ~ 1998.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.  Three right temporal
sharply contoured waveforms are captured.  They have an appearance of wicket waveforms, but they
stand out from the background.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp transients, few, right temporal
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Several sharply contoured right
temporal waveforms are of unclear clinical significance- they could be fragments of normal sleep
architecture vs represent true epileptiform discharges.  A repeat longer EEG is recommended.  The
findings of the EEG were discussed with the ordering physician.
