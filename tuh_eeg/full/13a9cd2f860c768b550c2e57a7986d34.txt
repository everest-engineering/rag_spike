CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed woman, status post left posterior frontal
meningioma resection, intermittent shaking of the right leg. This is her 5th EEG since 2003. She
has some ischemic white matter disease.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Triamterene, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Ranitidine, Amlodipine,
Insulin, Zyrtec
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system or
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: in wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well
organized with low voltage, but symmetric alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage,
frontocentral beta activity. Occasional focal slowing is noted in the left central temporal region.
In addition, there is a small amount of shifting temporal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits
bilateral driving.
HR: 55bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively isolated area of left frontocentral focal slowing.
2. Occasional shifting temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The bilateral features may be related to this patient's ischemic
white matter changes. No epileptiform activity has been seen in the past7 years. The left
frontocentral and central temporal focal slowing continues to abate, but the shifting slowing
maybe part of her underlying ischemic white matter pathology.
