CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old female with history of new onset seizures described as having strange feeling, seeing colors and patterns, and bad smell followed by 30 seconds of loss of consciousness and post event confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, posterior dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which was distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, prolonged EEG monitoring may be helpful.
