CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old woman status post code on October 19, 2009,
intubated now with jerking movements of the left shoulder, history of renal failure,
dialysis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS: Heparin, Cardizem, Metoprolol, Amiodarone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
biting down on the endotracheal tube.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a low voltage relatively
featureless pattern with significant muscle artifact. The technologist uses the 70 Hz
filter, again, a low voltage pattern with beta and muscle artifact ensues. Eye movements
are observed in the EEG, as well as some lateral rectus muscle spikes and other
electrographic evidence of muscle spikes, although it is difficult to see the patient
moving.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a low voltage beta and featureless
pattern, as well as muscle artifact.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. This EEG is
suggesting a worrisome prognosis in that there is little in the way of normal wave forms.
To more completely evaluate the cerebral activity, a repeat study with use of a
neuromuscular agent if appropriate may be considered.
