History:	58 year old female who had an episode of generalized shaking and preserved
consciousness.
Medications:	Ativan, Cardizem, Norvasc, Tiotropium, Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute portable EEG, awake, drowsy, and mostly asleep. The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
