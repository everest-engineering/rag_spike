Medications:	KEPPRA, SEROQUEL, ASA, LIPITOR, KLONOPIN, BENADRYL, LISINOPRIL,
PROTONIX, METOPROLOL, AMBIEN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and well-organized with a posterior dominant
rhythm of 9 Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by
background slowing and attenuation of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Sleep transients are not
captured during this study.
There is abundant, nearly continuous, left frontotemporal polymorphic slowing.  There is
occasional, milder independent right frontotemporal polymorphic slowing.  No epileptiform
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, abundant, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, right frontotemporal, independent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of abundant left frontotemporal
polymorphic slowing and independent right frontotemporal polymorphic slowing. These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left > right frontotemporal cerebral dysfunction, which
may be structural or physiologic in origin.
