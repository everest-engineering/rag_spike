CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed woman with new onset seizures
November 29, 2011, asthma, anxiety, and headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Tylenol #3, Flexeril, Motrin, Flovent, Albuterol, Ciprodex, Advair
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10Â·20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION-OF THE -RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized. There is an 8.5 to 9 Hz alpha rhythm with his relatively low voltage.
There is generous beta. In relaxed wakefulness, there is some shifting, frontocentral
theta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in
theta. Sustained sleep is not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal awake and drowsy EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Disorganization greater than anticipated for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow-up EEG capturing sleep is suggested. Some of this
patients CNS acting medications may have contributed to the theta described above.
