CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old gentleman status post left carotid endarterectomy
followed by right intracerebral hemorrhage. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, TIA and atrial
fibrillation.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Hydralazine, Metoprolol, Metoprolol, HCTZ, Famotidine,
Gentamicin, Ancef, Zosyn, Vancomycin.
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
poorly responsive. He has had a recent right craniotomy.
OF THE RECORD: This background EEG is markedly abnormal and
includes rhythmic 4-5 hertz theta frequency activity with some underlying delta. There is
clearly a breech rhythm with accentuation of activity on the right. Other features include
an asymmetry with more delta on the right. Sharp waves are noted in the right
hemisphere and can be found in the right frontal region, frontocentral, occasionally right
temporal and event posterior temporal region. Triphasic waves are also observed.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing with a disruption of faster frequency activity on the right as well as an
increase in arrhythmic delta.
2. Focal sharp waves in the right hemisphere with particular right frontocentral region.
3. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded, but this EEG supports a
structural process on the right as well as more than 1 area of potential epileptogenesis.
