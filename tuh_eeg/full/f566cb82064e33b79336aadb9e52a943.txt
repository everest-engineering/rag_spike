CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed woman with absence epilepsy since age 7, previously treated with Zarontin, but she recently stopped her medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Iron
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This patient had a clinical seizure during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The best organized EEG is at the end of the record with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm in a symmetric background.
In the beginning of the EEG, there is a subtle asymmetry.  There seems to be a disruption of faster frequency activity in the right frontal region.  In addition, there is some sharply contoured activity in the left frontocentral region.  In this somewhat sharply contoured background, there seems to be a very subtle underlying sharp wave which can be seen at T3/T5 and C3.
A 10-second seizure is characterized by inability of the patient to respond.  That event occurs at 11:39:11.  It seems to begin with a burst of high amplitude 6.5 Hz activity which transitions to 3 Hz activity over 10 seconds.  Severe high amplitude discharge, but there seems to be a frontally predominant spike and wave discharge and interestingly, the focal features noted earlier on in the record disappear. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
The appearance of an absence seizure.
Focal features with some subtle focal slowing and sharp waves at T3, T5 and C3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.  We will try and identify this patient's care providers to arrange for follow-up care.
