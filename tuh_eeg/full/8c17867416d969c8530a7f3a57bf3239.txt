History:	48 year old woman with a history of right ICH, requiring a surgery, with subsequent
seizures.  Patient now presents with an episode concerning for a seizure.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right temporal region during
wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right temporal
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and Drowsy 21-minute EEG because of continuous moderate
focal slowing in the right temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in
this region.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically
indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
