History:	76 YR OLD FEMALE TRANSFERRED FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL FOR STATUS
WAS ON VIMPAT STOPPED DUE TO EXPENSE.  PT HAS LEFT FACIAL TWITCH
AROUND BROW, LEFT UE JERK WHICH SOMETIMES IS IN LEFT SIDE BODY
Medications:	Ativan, Vimpat
Sedation:	Lorazepam
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent independent bilateral frontotemporal (right more than left) polymorphic delta activity is
present  At times with a more posterior temporal component on the right.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  At one point at the end of the record a rhythmic myogenic artifact is seen
for 34 seconds over the left frontal region with to cerebral EEG correlate noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 66 and Irregular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent independent bilateral focal
slowing in the frontotemporal (right more than left) region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
present. The EEG myogenic artifact had no EEG correlate as such it may represent movement
disorder or alternatively it may represent a simple partial seizure which may only have an EEG
