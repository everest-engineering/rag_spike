History:	54 year old man with extensive PMH, including history of renal dysfunction and
alcohol abuse.
Medications:	Lipitor, Glucotrol, Aspirin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by very low voltage 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
complexes appear.  Patient transitions rapidly between wakefulness and drowsiness/ sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization, mild
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 24-minute EEG due to mild disorganization that
indicates etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction that, in this case, could be
related to excessive drowsiness. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
