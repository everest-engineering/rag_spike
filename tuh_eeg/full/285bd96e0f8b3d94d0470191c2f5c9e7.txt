History:	57 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O HTN EMERGENCY AND BLEEDING
FROM PEG. PMHX SIG FOR RT LARGE  MCA STROKE 2/14 WITH LT
HEMIPARESIS, CAD, HLD, GERD
Medications:	ASA, Plavix, Coreg
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharply contoured waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout
the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep
There are almost continuous focal slowing and attenuation with loss of faster frequencies over the
right posterior quadrant region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Attenuation, nearly continuous, right posterior quadrant
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Technically limited, right, Muscle and electrode artifact
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing with triphasic waves and
absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  right posterior quadrant focal slowing and attenuation is consistent with a history of
right hemispheric stroke.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
