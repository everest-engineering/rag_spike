CLINICAL HISTORY:    32 year old right handed female with depression, anxiety, recent frost-bite injury, hepatitis C with a seizure January 4, with incontinence.  Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 50 mV.  In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is well organized.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing.  Hyperventilation produces posteriorly predominant slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:     60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The posteriorly predominant hyperventilation response is an unusual finding in an adult, but is not pathological.
