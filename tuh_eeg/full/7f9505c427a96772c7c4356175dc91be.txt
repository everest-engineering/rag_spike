History:	57 YO FEMALE WITH A HX OF SZ, DEPRESSION, HTN, THYROID DISEASE.
LAST SZ 2 YEARS AGO.F/U EEG. AURA- H/A, THEN FALLS DOWN WITH
UNKNOWN DURATION. - SHAKING, + TONGUE BITE, - INCONT. POSTICTAL H/A
Medications:	ABILIFY
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a very low amplitude, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 3 to 21 fps.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep
was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
