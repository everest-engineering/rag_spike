CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old woman, within seizure on August 27th, subsequent agitation, treated with Haldol and then an episode of unresponsiveness, history of polypharmacy and frequent falling.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin, heparin, and Haldol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, with a brief arousal, there is a 5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of a sleep state with features of spindles and POSTS.  Intermittently, in drowsiness, there is some subtle underlying rhythmic delta noted in the right hemisphere.  This ameliorates when the patient is stimulated or as the patient transitions into deeper stages of stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving, despite the fact that the patient was asleep.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to;
Generalized background slowing.
Hypersomnolence patient.
Subtle, infrequent slowing noted in the right hemisphere.
