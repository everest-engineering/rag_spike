History:	71 year old female who presents for a follow up post dc'd from TUH on  6/16/14, for
altered mental status and loss of consciousness along with episode of shaking
lasting 1-2 min.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present over the bilateral anterior temporal regions during
drowsiness, left more prominent than the right.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is probably a NORMAL 41-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Some focal bitemporal
slowing during drowsiness is considered normal in those over the age of 65 years old.  Excessive
beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
