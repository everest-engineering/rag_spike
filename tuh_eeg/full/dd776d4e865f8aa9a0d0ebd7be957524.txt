CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old woman with hypertension, depression, asthma and Alzheimer disease admitted with transient left arm weakness found to have left parasagittal cavernous angioma.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Vertex waves were observed in stage I sleep and the patient transitions readily in and out of sleep.
Notable in this record was intermittent, focal slowing from the right hemisphere with initially isolated theta delta noted in hyperventilation and a little bit more intermittent, but sustained focal slowing noted as the patient transitions towards drowsiness.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep and did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:  Intermittent focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The intermittent focal slowing may be correlated with imaging.  In this individual with a history of Alzheimer disease, there was no generalized background slowing.  This EEG may be correlated with imaging, but consideration for either a structural process or a transient process such as TIA or postictal state may be considered.
