CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy with bilateral frontal gliosis.  ? PTE vs early developmental brain pathology.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamictal, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  72 hour Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This EEG captures wakefulness and sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
02/02/2015 to  02/03/2015
Background: In maximal wakefulness, there is a low voltage pattern, but with a well-defined 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Epileptiform discharges: None
Seizures: None
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 24-hour video EEG monitoring.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Ongoing medication adjustment will follow.
DATE:  February 3, 2015, to February 4, 2015.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra reduction, topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  This is stage II of continuous video EEG monitoring.  The patient had no clinical symptoms.  He tried to conduct sleep deprivation until 3:00 a.m. and used the bedside bike.
Background:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes well organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta and sleep abundant, well organized stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted.
Epileptiform discharges: None
Seizures: None
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  A 24-hour normal continuous video EEG monitoring without clinical events.
 02/04/2015 to  02/05/2015- Keppra held, OXC stopped.
Background: In maximal wakefulness, there is a low voltage pattern, but with a well-defined 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Epileptiform discharges: None
Seizures: None
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 72 -hour video EEG monitoring session.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The patient’s clinical history, exam and imaging were  reviewed. Normal EEG in the context of abnormal MRI and history of frequent severe seizures after minor TBI.  While a normal 72 hour EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, other factors may be considered.  The patient’s behavior prohibited longer inpatient EEG recording and if additional studies are needed, an ambulatory EEG can be considered.
