CLINICAL HISTORY:  28-year-old woman with stress-related seizures, increased after recent motor vehicle accident.  Previous victim of violence, traumatic brain injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, gabapentin, phenytoin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had clinical events with shaking from side to side, preceded by an aura during this EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 9 Hz.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing.  Sleep is somewhat disrupted for this adult.  Early slow wave sleep with higher amplitude 2 Hz delta was noted.  Stage 2 sleep was also obtained.
Events:  The patient had symptoms between the time of 11:59 to 12:54.  She was able to push the button, notified the nurse and described her symptoms.  She felt a vibrating sensation in her body.  She then demonstrated very rapid, thrashing side-to-side movements.
No EEG changes were noted with these behaviors aside from artifact and no postictal slowing was identified.  The patient's most prominent motor activity was at 12:55 and then afterward she was lying motionless in the bed, her head turned to the right with a normal awake EEG.
EKG:  Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
Normal 24-hour continuous video EEG monitoring session.
One event described by the patient as her typical seizure without EEG correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the patient, who was given the diagnosis of a stress-related seizure or a nonepileptic seizure.  The patient concurred with this diagnosis as well as discontinuation of phenytoin.
