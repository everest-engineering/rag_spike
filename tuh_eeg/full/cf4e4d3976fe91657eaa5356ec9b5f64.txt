REASON FOR STUDY:  Followup from seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while in wakefulness.
Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, phenobarbital, Serax, thiamine, aspirin, Unasyn.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old man found to have hyponatremia and recurrent focal right arm shaking, focal seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, best seen over the right hemisphere, but also the left, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Overall, the EEG has a pretty normal background, but at times, there is a burst of monomorphic frontal delta, consistent with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity that lasts, at most, 3 to 4 seconds.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow wave over T3, seen frequently in a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Intermittent bursts of FIRDA seen throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left temporal slowing, as well as intermittent FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral  dysfunction in the left midtemporal region in addition to diffuse cerebral  dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this is a much improved EEG compared to the previous recordings.
