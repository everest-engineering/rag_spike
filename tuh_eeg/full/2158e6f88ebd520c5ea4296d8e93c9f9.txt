CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old woman with history of breast cancer and left auxiliary node dissection, status post radiation therapy with a history of asthma also, presents with new onset seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Heparin, Tylenol, Anastrozole
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in limited wakefulness and sleep with no activating procedures being performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background that is mainly noted during sleep and with limited wakefulness appears to have a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There is limited amount of frontocentral beta seen during the recording due to the limited wakefulness.  In addition, there appears to be mild excess theta during this part of wakefulness.  The patient rapidly goes into stage 1 and stage 2 which is the majority of the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta during limited wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excessive theta in limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
