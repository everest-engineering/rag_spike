REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Dilantin, Zyrtec, and Singulair.
HISTORY:  A 25-year-old man with a history of a seizure and subsequently found to have a brain tumor resected in 2009 followed by radiation at Cooper Hospital.  He has a chief complaint of headaches and as per wife, episodes of shaking and mouth biting 2-3 times every night.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F3 during wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  Please note that there is an asymmetry in amplitude at that region consistent with a breach.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate 72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left frontal sharp waves and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal region, which is consistent with the known tumor resection.  No seizures were seen.
