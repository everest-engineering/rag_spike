CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with past history of liver disease, heart failure, stroke, evaluated in emergency about a year ago for seizure, now with an episode of problems with his legs, followed by tonic clonic seizures. Recent episode of left leg heaviness and shakiness without loss of consciousness in October 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Occasionally in the transition to drowsiness, and in drowsiness, there is a slight asymmetry with a bit of delta activity, which is somewhat slower in the right occipital region compared to the left. This is an intermittent finding. At other times the record is quite symmetric. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Focal slowing from the right occipital region seen primarily in drowsiness, but on occasion also noted in wakefulness with rare disruption of alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with the patient's CT scan demonstrating right occipital encephalomalacia.
