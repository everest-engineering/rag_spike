CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, medication non-adherence, breakthrough seizure, seizure last night with post-ictal state.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was performed. Photic stimulation was impossible.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The tracing begins with the patient quite drowsy with rhythmic theta. She has prominent sharply contoured 5-7 hertz activity in the central regions even during hyperventilation. Throughout the record, there is prominent sharp wave contoured 6 hertz activity in the central region. This does not seem to be associated with changes in an individuals behavior. It persists in wakefulness and in what seems to be stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A pattern of prominent central theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an unusual paroxysmal pattern. It may be a form of a generalized epilepsy. Additional evaluation and/or alternative medication therapy may be appropriate.
