CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old left handed man with history of peri-stroke, anoxic injury, seizures, hepatitis C, who presents with increased change in mental status and EEG to rule out subclinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lovenox, Lorazepam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out subclinical seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was mainly lethargic during this study and some sleep was recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is a small amount of T4 electrode artifact continuously throughout the recording period.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low voltage diffusely slow background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta.  Some waves forms are consistent with stage I sleep were seen, but no classic sleep architecture is clearly present.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz seen continuously.  At one point during the EEG there is stimulation and there is an increased amount of muscle artifact and frequencies improved to a theta frequency.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
