History:	56 year old man who is on ECMO.  Ancillary studies are showing that the right
cerebral hemisphere is possibly hypoperfusion.  EEG is performed to assess for
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms and lower voltages over the
left hemisphere.  There is also no PDR or AP gradient.  The background over the right hemisphere
consists of a mixture of diffuse alpha- theta activity admixed with bursts of diffuse delta activity.
The background over the left hemisphere demonstrates paucity of faster frequencies and voltage
attenuation.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
There is no change in the background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and continuous
focal slowing and attenuation over the left hemisphere. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient is at least partially
medication induced (based on the waveforms present).  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  Voltage attenuation could be secondary to a fluid collection
between a skull and a brain, such as SDH, empyema, et etc.  These findings were conveyed to the
neurology consult team and the primary team.
