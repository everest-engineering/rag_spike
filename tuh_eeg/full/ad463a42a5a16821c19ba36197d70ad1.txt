CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old left handed female with migraine headaches and epilepsy with bipolar disease.

MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Wellbutrin, Klonopin, Haldol, Seroquel, Fioricet

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is very drowsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak is noted with an increase in frequency of the alpha rhythm.  Much of the record includes stage II sleep with Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindle cell posts.  Hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing and/or anterior spread of the alpha rhythm are noted as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.  The patient is falling asleep in both hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  Occasional eye movements are noted in and out of the transition from sleep.

HR:    72 bpm with occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG primarily in stage II sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A clinical evaluation to determine the cause of the patient's excessive drowsiness may be of value.
