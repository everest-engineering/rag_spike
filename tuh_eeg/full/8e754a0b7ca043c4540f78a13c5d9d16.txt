CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with history of epilepsy, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and hypothyroidism.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Synthroid, lamotrigine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging EEG in an uncooperative patient.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a pattern with rhythmic theta, generous beta, and a glimpse of a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The patient is moving nearly continuously throughout the EEG with significant eye movement artifacts.  Despite this, there are occasional bursts of frontal delta.
In this sharply contoured record, as the patient became a little bit drowsy, there is more prominent rhythmic frontal delta.  There appeared to be discrete, bifrontal sharp waves, however, there is also nearly continuous eye movement artifact.
Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record.
Heart rate irregular 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to,
Large background slowing and disorganization.
Prominent frontal theta.
Questionable frontal or bifrontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison at this time.  The patient was consolable toward the end of the EEG.  To more completely evaluate her underlying epileptiform activity, a more prolonged, 1-hour EEG, perhaps utilizing pharmacologic sedation is suggested.
