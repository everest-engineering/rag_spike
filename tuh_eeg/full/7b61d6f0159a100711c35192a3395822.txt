REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake. Activating procedures including photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Keppra, aspirin, metoprolol, Lipitor, Protonix.
HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old man with slurred speech, confusion, unsteady gait and dizziness, generalized weakness, left PCA stroke, and AFib, hypertension and diabetes now with right-sided weakness and confusion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is normal frontocentral beta seen.  This is slightly decreased over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 84.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/D3 and occasionally at F8/D4 throughout the recording.  These were seen at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left more than right anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral left more than right anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is likely related to the subdural hemorrhage and stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
