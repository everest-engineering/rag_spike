History:	pt had a new onset sz DEC 22. head ct normal. went to er got home from er had
another sz. pt lost consciousness. pt was sleeping, husband woke up to pt in tonic
position, clenching teeth, + full body shaking. lasting 1-2 min. + tongue bite, -
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
intermediate flash rates.  There is a single episode of right arm shaking that occurs at 11:05AM.
There is no EEG correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. A single episode of right arm shaking was without EEG correlate.
