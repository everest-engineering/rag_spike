:
History:	46 year old man with a seizure, found to have left sided AVM, now status post-surgery.
No seizures since then. Patient has a history of seizures in childhood.
Medications:	Keppra, Prilosec, Neurontin, Lisinopril, Glipizide.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to continuous mild left temporal slowing. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
