CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old male, in rehabilitation setting, states that he is clean with alcohol abuse for 1 month.  The patient had a seizure in the rehab center, then 20-minute seizure in transport with EMS, and another in the emergency room at Temple just prior to this recording.  He received 1000 mg of fosphenytoin and doses of both Ativan and midazolam.
MEDICATIONS:  Fosphenytoin, 6 mg of Versed, and 4 mg of Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit with the patient consent using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The session was terminated after 6 hours when the patient withdrew his consent for EEG monitoring and demanded Valium and Klonopin.  The house officer confirmed that the patient had not been receiving Valium and Klonopin in the halfway house.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  The vast majority of this EEG includes wakefulness with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Beta activity is a little more prominent in the early portions of the record.  Patient is essentially awake and alert throughout.
Later in the recording, the patient removed the EEG electrodes.  He complained of ear pain and seemed restless and left the monitoring unit after 6 hours.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with good quality recording for 5 hours.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 3rd normal EEG for this adult.  None of the studies have demonstrated epileptiform activity, although some have demonstrated excess beta.
Ongoing vigilance for a diagnosis other than epilepsy may be appropriate for this individual.
