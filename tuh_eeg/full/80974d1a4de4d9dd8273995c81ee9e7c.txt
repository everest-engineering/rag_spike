CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old woman with Down syndrome, previously with better
controlled seizures, now with increasing brief seizures with Incontinence and dropping
as well as some tonic-clonic seizures. Recent ankle fracture.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Vimpat.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is cooperative.
Photic stimulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
slow and disorganized. It is difficult to identify a posterior dominant rhythm and there is generous beta and theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background
slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There is a fair amount of
muscle artifact noted in the sleep record particularly in the frontal regions and the
muscle artifact persists into stage II sleep. In stage II sleep, in the transition in and out of sleep, there is a suggestion of a left parietal sharp wave.

HR: 70bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slow and disorganization.
2. Questionable left parietal sharp wave.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual has had many different patterns of
epileptiform activity. Overall, the epileptiform activity was markedly reduced today. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of value.
