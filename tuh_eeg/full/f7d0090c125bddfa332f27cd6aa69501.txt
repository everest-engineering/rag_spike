DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background of EEG demonstrates diffuse slowing with mixture of delta and delta.  With arousals small increase in theta activity was noted.  There was more muscle artifact on the left.
Heart rate: 66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is EEG is remarkable for diffuse background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with acute stroke, there is no significant focal slowing or epileptiform features. Overall, the EEG is more supportive of diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
