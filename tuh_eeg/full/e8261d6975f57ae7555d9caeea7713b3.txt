Technique:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system was performed utilized a NicOne system. The study captures wakefulness and sleep. Photic stimulation was performed.
EEG Background:
The waking background was characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR).
The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude was present. Occasional, mild, age appropriate slowing was noted in the temporal regions.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing were seen.
There were normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep was not seen.
No generalized slowing was present.	No focal slowing was present.
Paroxysmal Activity (non-epileptiform) : None
Epileptiform Activity:
No epileptiform activity was present.
Photic Stimulation: bilateral driving was observed HR: 72 BPM
Clinical Events:
There were no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
Impression:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG for an adult of this age.	There were no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
Clinical Correlation:
This study is markedly improved from the prior study which demonstrated generalized study (07/08/15).
Neither study identified epileptiform features
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
