History:	53 year old woman with a history of headaches now presents with gradual loss of
peripheral vision.
Medications:	Neurontin, Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity that is attenuated
by eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  Additional, overriding ~8 Hz diffuse monomorphic
theta activity is observed.  During brief drowsiness, diffuse beta activity becomes more prominent
with several vertex waves observed.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to mildly slow posterior dominant
rhythm (PDR). This is an non-specific finding that could indicate mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
However, given the fact that patient's PDR is well reactive, this PDR may just represent low variant
of PDR - which is a normal finding.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep
was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
