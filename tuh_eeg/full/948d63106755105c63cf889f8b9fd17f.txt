CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old woman who had a cardiac arrest 02120 lasting 30 minutes.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Nystatin, Ativan, Cefepime, Pantoprazole, Metronidazole,
Atovaquone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10.20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage slow
relatively featureless record with a small amount of eye movement artifact. The data is so
suppressed that it can be reformatted into ECS montage. In montage, there is low voltage slow
delta activity identified as wen as some very slow periodic eye movements which occurs
approximately once per 5 seconds. The range for t he eye movement is 3á7 seconds, but It
averages approximately once per 5 seconds. The cerebral activity can be reviewed at a very
slow paper speed. There is no slow, underlying epileptiform pattern observed. Stimulation of the
patient produces muscle, but no alerting response.
HR: 97 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a markedly slow abnormal pattern.
2. Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function. If
the individual is not on anesthetic doses of sedative hypnotic medications, additional testing
-may be important to further define this patients prognosis.
