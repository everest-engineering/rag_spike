CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old with ICH and posterior circulation Dural arteriovenous malformations.
MEDICATIONS:  Verapamil, Seroquel, Abilify, PROPOFOL, SEVOFLURANE and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Three-hour forty-minute EEG was performed in the angiography suite using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient had a dural AVM, treated during the study. This study was monitored with one-to-one physician remote review, with EEG physician present in IR 0.25 hours.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing began, the patient is awake.  There is generous beta and small amounts of theta.  There is a small amount of background slowing and it is somewhat difficult to define an alpha rhythm.
With the use of sedation, the EEG initially transitions to an anesthetic pattern, 1st with generous beta and then a briefly discontinuous pattern.  As a stable, anesthetic pattern, develops at 03:40 p.m., there is a subtle underlying asymmetry with a bit more focal slowing noted in the right posterior quadrant.
The interventional team places catheter at 4 p.m. and then revised to use an alternative catheter.  Catheters are placed and withdrawn between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.  During this time, the patient's background EEG demonstrates a stable pattern with a pharmacologic pattern with mixed theta and delta.  No significant focal features were noted with placement of the catheter.
Heart rate 60-132 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  The EEG monitoring during this procedure identified an asymmetry with sedation, but no focal features were noted during the intervention.
