Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9-Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, attenuation of the alpha and rhythmic background slowing followed by vertex waves.
Artifacts in the record include PVC and eye movement artifact. Heart rate 90, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
