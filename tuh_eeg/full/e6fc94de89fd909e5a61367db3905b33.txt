CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed male admitted on May 15, 2011 with generalized tonic clonic seizure activity, 3 seizures, associated with incontinence. Past history of depression, chronic pain, asthma, diabetes, morbid obesity, DVT, and skin grafts.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Coumadin, Lamictal, Oxycodone, Hydralazine, Neurontin, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. The overall EEG is somewhat sharply contoured. There is some rhythmic theta of drowsiness. Other features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in background theta.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: This is a relatively unremarkable EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features identified. It is an overall sharply contoured EEG. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
