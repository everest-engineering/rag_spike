History:	25 YR OLD MALE  WITH MR AND EPILEPSY.PMHX. DM GRAND MAL SEIZURES
LAST SEIZURE FROM AIDE WAS ON FRIDAY 1-23.15 6TH ONE THIS MONTH
PT.HAS A VAGUS STIM ON LEFT SIDE OF HIS CHEST.
Medications:	KEPPRA,TRILEPTAL,DEPAKOTE,LEXAPRO,ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present which at best reached 6Hz.  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal spike-and-wave discharges and sharp waves are present
in the multiple independent regions (T4 & T4/A2, T6 > T3 & T3/A1, T5).  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
90  The EKG electrode was lost.
Summary of Findings:
Disorganization
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Spikes and sharp waves multifocal, Right mid and posterior temporal > Left mid and posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in multiple regions.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region, and given the
clinical history of seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of multifocal epilepsy. In addition there
is diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
