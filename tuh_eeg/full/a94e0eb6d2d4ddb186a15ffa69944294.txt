History:	27 year old man undergoing hypothermia protocol.
Medications:	PROPOFOL, MIDAZOLAM, DOPAMINE.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and
EKG/Hypothermia electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of nurse-suppression pattern with
occasional brief bursts consisting of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  No normal
sleep architecture is present.
There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
heart rate of 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, severe
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 30-minute portable EEG due to severe burst-suppression pattern and lack of
reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of marked diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  In this patient, this pattern could be partially related to the medication effect.
