AGE: 39 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 10/06/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1469
HISTORY:
a 39 y.o. male with a history of head trauma at age 2 and seizures beginning at age 5 (tonic clonic seizures with tongue biting, bladder incontinence, postictal confusion) . He is reportedly seizure-free for 15 years.	On 9/6/15 he had an episode of R sided numbness, headache, and blurry vision.
MEDICATIONS:
No current outpatient prescriptions on file.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit. SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening.
During a brief period of drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy	routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy routine EEG. No sleep is captured.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy
