INCREASED BP
PMHX: AFIB, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM, CYSTOCYLE S/P, PESSARY
Medications:	PROTONIX, COLACE, HUMULIN, KAYEXALATE, CARDIZEM, IMIPENEM,
LEVALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Background
activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity.  State changes were seen but no typical
sleep architecture was seen.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region, maximal at T4.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 120
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, bilateral
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to diffuse background slowing and intermittent
right anterior temporal slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
focal and diffuse cerebral dysfunction which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
