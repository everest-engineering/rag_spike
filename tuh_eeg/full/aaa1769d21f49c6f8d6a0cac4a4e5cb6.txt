History:	61 year old man who was admitted with left thalamic hemorrhage.  He now has
change in mental status and left arm shaking.
Medications:	Keppra, Ativan and Fentanyl
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a primarily delta activity and
occasional theta activity.  Paucity of faster frequencies and voltage attenuation are noted over the
right.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.  There is moderate amount of EMG artifact.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, right hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, right hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing that is
more pronounced over the right hemisphere. This finding is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  There is moderate amount of movement during the recording.
These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
