CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old male with mental retardation, behavioral disorder, history of childhood seizures, reportedly seizure-free for the past 4 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Risperdal, Celexa, Cogentin, Ritalin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and record for an individual with poor communication skills.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The waking background is abnormal.  There is a glimpse of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm in the background with excess beta and excess theta.  The background is interrupted by intermittent bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude, frontally predominant, 2.5 to 4 Hz spike and wave activity with most bursts less than 3 seconds in duration.  Superimposed upon this are bursts of more prominent right temporal focal slowing and a handful of right temporal sharp waves.  Some of the spike and wave discharges are posteriorly predominant.
Hyperventilation may accentuate the frontally predominant spike and wave complexes.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  It does not appear to significantly accentuate the spike and wave activity, although, there was a polyspike and wave discharge with photic stimulation.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Excess beta.
Frontally predominant spike and wave activity with slow spike and wave activity.
Some right temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings have been seen in previous EEGs in 2011 and 2012.  This EEG supports an ongoing predisposition to seizures.
