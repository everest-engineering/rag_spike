History:	74 YR MALE FOLLOW UP EEG ON PATIENT WITH CC OF DIZZINESS AND
EPISODE OF UNRESP.  PMHX: CVA 10 YRS AGO AND LEGALLY BLIND
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
