AGE: 53 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 10/12/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: EMU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1498
HISTORY:
53 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for intractable localization-related epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 3 tablets by mouth in the morning and evening
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, Take l tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
citalopram (CELEXA) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 50 mg tablet, One tablet in the AM and l tablet in the PM
ramipril (ALTACE) 10 mg capsule, Take 10 mg by mouth daily. LORATADINE (CLARITIN PO), Take by mouth daily.
Patient states she has been off all antiepileptics for 24 hours SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) consisting of low voltage fast frequencies. The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, diffuse background slowing are seen. Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is continuous right temporal polymorphic slowing. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
There are frequent right fronto-temporal (F8/T2/T4>Fp2>F4 max) sharp-and-wave complexes
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal Awake and drowsy routine EEG due to:
l. Continuous right temporal polymorphic slowing
2. Frequent right fronto-temporal (F8/T2/T4>Fp2>F4 max) sharp-and-wave complexes
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of right temporal cerebral dysfunction and right fronto-tempo l epileptogenic potentials.
