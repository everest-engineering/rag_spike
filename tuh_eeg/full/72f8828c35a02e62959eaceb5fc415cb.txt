REASON FOR STUDY:  Jerking after anoxic injury.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old man found hanging, coded for approximately 15 minutes, then coded another 18 minutes.  He has a history of childhood seizures and has been noted to be twitching once he got to the emergency room.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an almost completely suppressed background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.  Overall, the EEG has an almost completely suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity noted.  There is superimposed muscle activity.  At times the patient appears to jerk and there appears to be some rhythmic slowing that cannot be clearly deciphered if it is coming from the brain or just an artifact from the movement.  With stimulation, there is that increasing muscle artifact, but no clear improvement in the frequencies of the background.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to diffusely suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity and myoclonic jerks with no clear electrocerebral correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is consistent with an anoxic injury.  The jerking is clinically consistent with myoclonus; however, it is difficult to determine if there is an EEG correlate with these jerks.  Overall, this EEG is suggestive of a poor prognosis.
