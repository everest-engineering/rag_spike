INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic simulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately  organized with 10.5 Hz, 30 microvolt alpha rhythm and a small amount of wicket activity. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in the record. A  normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of seizure or stroke and correlation with imaging and history may be appropriate.
