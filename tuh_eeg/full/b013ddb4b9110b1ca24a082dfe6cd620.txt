CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed male who had resection of a tumor on his knee and buttocks, and then coded at 6:30 this morning.  Unresponsive until 8:30 a.m. and then the patient experienced lip smacking.

MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Midazolam, Metoprolol, Amiodarone, Famotidine, Vecuronium

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive in the initial sections of the record, but was more responsive later on.  This EEG was recorded 9 hours after the cardiac arrest.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Initially, the patient is somewhat drowsy with a mixed frequency background.  As the recording continues, he arouses spontaneously with initially anterior alpha activity and then brief arousals with low voltage posterior dominant rhythm.  He drifts off to sleep with more of a slow background.  There are electrode problems throughout the EEG.

HR:    114 bpm

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits although there is limited wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The presence of an alpha rhythm and a reactive awake pattern are all positive prognostic features immediately following cardiac arrest.
