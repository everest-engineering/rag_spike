History:	30 Y.O. MALE P/W WITNESSED SZ,  PT HAD GENERALIZED SHAKING. IN ED
HE HAD MULTIPLE EPISODES OF CONVULSIONS W/OUT RETURN TO
BASELINE. PT RECEIVED VERSED 2MG X3, ATIVAN 1 MG X2, DILANTIN
1500MG. HX OF TBI W/ RETROGRADE AMNESIA FROM AUTO PED 2 YR AGO.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse, excess theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing
This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
