History:	54 YR MAN WITH CC CONVULSIONS 2-3 PER YR.ASSOC WITH FALLS, PMHX:
SZS, CEREBRAL PALSY, DOWN SYNDROME, PROFOUND MR, 1 HR STUDY
Medications:	TOPAMAX, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions (right more
than left) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal spikes and
sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F4, C4, T4 and F8.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 108
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Disorganization
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) temporal, mid
Sharp waves, frequent, right, Frontal, central and temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 hour EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the right central,
frontal and temporal regions.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region. In addition there is focal slowing and moderate  diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of focal and moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
