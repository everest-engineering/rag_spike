CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old woman with a long history of epilepsy, seizure free for the last 3 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, phenobarbital, and blood pressure medicines.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 7 Hz alpha rhythm with excess background theta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  The delta is a little lower voltage on the right, a little bit more irregular on the left.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record produces an increase in the amplitude of both hemispheres but a bit more irregular higher amplitudes following on the left with a single left temporal sharp wave.  Following hyperventilation, the asymmetry with a slight higher amplitude irregular slowing on the left persists.  As the patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep, there are occasional bursts of FIRDA.  Post, vertex waves and spindles were noted in sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting in and out of sleep.  A scant driving response was noted at faster flash frequencies.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A slow and somewhat disorganized pattern.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Despite some shifting asymmetries, left focal slowing, accentuated by hyperventilation and drowsiness.
Although there is only a single left temporal sharp wave noted in hyperventilation, sharply contoured left temporal focal slowing also noted in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Consideration for a structural functional process on the left is appropriate.  Although there was only a single sharp wave, a focal mechanism for epilepsy may be considered.  The findings described above may be correlated with both clinical history and the patient's hypertension history.
