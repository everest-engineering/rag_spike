CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 89-year-old male found unresponsive looking to the right, not talking or making eye contact.  Acute to subacute left cerebellar and left frontal infarcts with bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, HCTZ
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically challenging bedside record in a poorly cooperative patient.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is poorly organized, diffusely slow and lacks the hallmarks of a normal awake or a sleep pattern.  There is a mixed frequency pattern with a mixture of theta and delta.  More irregular and sharply contoured delta is noted in the right posterior quadrant.  Overall, there is a pattern of shifting slowing with slowing seen in left or right hemisphere.
Heart rate:  irregularly irregular, 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to.
Diffusely slow background.
Poorly organized pattern.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  There were no seizures recorded.  This EEG supports a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  In this individual with bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, a follow-up study when the patient is more cooperative may be helpful to more completely assess potential underlying epileptiform activity.
