CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 33-year-old gentleman with a long history of refractory epilepsy since age 17, history of suicide attempts and depression. Admitted with exacerbation of complex partial seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine, Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient experiences no seizures in this portion of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As indicated in the initial history, the patient had a seizure prior to the hook up.  This section of the recording begins at 16:40.  The initial portions of the record show frequent high amplitude spike and slow wave activity from the left hemisphere with generalized background slowing and superimposed left temporal focal slowing.  This activity gradually abates.  By 17:43, the spike and slow wave activity is as infrequent as one high amplitude spike and slow discharge per 10 seconds.  The background from both hemispheres is markedly improved and the activity from the right hemisphere is nearly normal.  From the left hemisphere, there is an improvement in terms of alpha frequency activity, although there is ongoing rhythmic theta/delta from the left frontotemporal region.  Sleep is recorded overnight.  In sleep, again, there is an increase in high amplitude spike and slow wave activity from the left temporal region.  This is seen in stage I and stage II sleep with the associated focal slowing. There are spontaneous arousals from sleep.  This section of the record ends at 8:00 AM.  By the morning, the spike and slow wave activity has decreased dramatically.  There is ongoing rhythmic, 3 to 4 Hz activity from the left temporal region.  The right hemisphere is as described nearly normal.  There are intermittent bursts of higher amplitude, more irregular delta from the left.
HR:  56 BPM.
