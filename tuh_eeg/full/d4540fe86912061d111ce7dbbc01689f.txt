AGE: 57 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY : 09/16/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient EEG TYPE: 95819
EEG #: 15-1366
HISTORY:
57 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for seizures with LOC and eyes rolling, Hx of	facial twitching, .
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
clonazepam (KLONOPIN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth 2 times daily as needed for Anxiety.
trifluoperazine (STELAZINE) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
Lorazepam (ATIVAN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 2 tablets by mouth 2 times daily.
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 750 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit .
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
Frontal artifact was present
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by scant, low voltage symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Frequent frontal twitch artifact was seen.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: elicits an increase in amplitude Photic Stimulation: elicits bilateral driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
