CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed female, 26-weeks pregnant, history of
epilepsy since infancy, never treated with seizure medications. Typical seizures are
tonic clonic with loss of consciousness and tongue biting, positive family history of
epilepsy. Last seizure was several months ago. She Is also reported to have adult
onset, rather than childhood onset, epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Prenatal Multivitamins.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.
The patient is drowsy and transitions readily into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with vertex
waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The patient is awakened for photic
stimulation. She demonstrates driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving In
faster flash frequencies, despite the drowsy state.
HR: 70 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness to stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed In this
record, however, a normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Given the
patient's pregnant state it may prudent to obtain an additional EEG recording or to
review old records to determine if previous EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform
activity.
