CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed female with diagnosis at age 40 with episode of twitching of the mouth and legs for 5 minutes with intermittent loss of consciousness.  She is here for seizure clarification.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol XR.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness, stage I sleep. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV again seen occasionally.  In addition, the patient has multiple bouts of rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness at times in single bursts and wickets frequently seen in both temporal lobes.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Infrequent left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
