CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed male with dizziness and loss of
consciousness in the context of dehydration, but a positive family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, Flovent, Veramyst, Concerta, Ambien
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized
with an 11 Hz, 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of
low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in
background theta, followed by POSTS. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude in the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features identified in
this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are
an important consideration, a follow-up study may be considered.
