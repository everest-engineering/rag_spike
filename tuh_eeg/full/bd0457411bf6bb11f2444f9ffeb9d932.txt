History:	49 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  BRAIN MASS, NEW ONSET SZ, LT
SIDE FLACCID. PMHX SIG FOR HIV, HEP C
Medications:	KEPPRA, PROPOFOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Frontally predominant intermixed  5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Intermittent
attenuation seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal spikes, polyspikes and sharp waves are present with
phase reversal and amplitude maximum at T6.  Four electrographic seizures are recorded
beginning with rhythmic theta activity in the posterior temporal region and evolving into 14 Hz
activity that remains over the temporal lobe with some anterior spread. The seizures last about 2 to
3 minutes.  There was no clinical correlate associated to this EEG activity documented on video.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 96
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, frequent, right temporal, posterior, electrographic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent subclinical electrographic seizures arising from
the right posterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of an epileptogenic focus in this
region, and are consistent with subclinical status epilepticus.
