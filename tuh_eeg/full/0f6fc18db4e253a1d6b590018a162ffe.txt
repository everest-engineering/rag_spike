REASON FOR STUDY:  Visual field deficits and speech problems.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 62-year-old lady with a history of left ICH post evacuation of hematoma.  She now complains of speech problems and visual deficits with unsteady gait.
MEDICATIONS:  Cyanocobalamin, metoprolol, lisinopril, amlodipine, sertraline, and vitamins.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1-channel EKG.  Wakefulness and sleep were captured.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 11 Hz frequency and 30-60 microvolts in amplitude on the right side.  The alpha rhythm on the left side is disrupted and at times reaches a frequency of 11 Hz.  There is a breached rhythm noted in the left occipital region.
Sleep was recorded which was characterized by sleep spindles and K complexes.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Photic stimulation was performed which did not change the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Continuous T5 slowing in the theta and delta range.  Frequently sharply contoured but not clearly epileptogenic.
Occasional T3 slowing in the theta and delta range which is also sharply contoured but not clearly epileptogenic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to left posterior temporal and mid temporal slowing which is sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of left posterior temporal cerebral dysfunction with a lightly underlying structural abnormality.  No seizures or clear epileptogenic features were identified.  A prolonged EEG might be helpful in capturing epileptogenic activity if any.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
