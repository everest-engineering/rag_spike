REASON FOR STUDY:  Unresponsiveness.
CLINICAL HISTORY: A 56-year-old man found unresponsive with history of seizures, hypertension, diabetes and pancreatic cancer.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Ativan, Lovenox, Protonix, vancomycin, Zosyn.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient is recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no abnormal posterior dominant rhythm, frontocentral rhythm or frontocentral beta.   Overall, there appears to be background consisting of delta slow wave which have an overlying intermix alpha to beta.  Frequency seen diffusely throughout the recording.  When the patient is called, there appears to be an increase in muscle artifact on the EEG with a slight improvement of faster frequencies.  There also appears to be some normal sleep architecture seen intermittently.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  66.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously with intermix alpha to beta frequency seen diffusely.
Seizures, none.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormality EEG due to generalized slowing with intermixed faster frequencies overlying it.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to the etiology.  However, the overlying beta may suggest that it may be due at in parts to medication effect.  No seizures are clear or epileptiform discharges were seen.
