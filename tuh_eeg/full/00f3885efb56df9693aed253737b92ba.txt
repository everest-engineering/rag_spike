Lancets Misc, by Other route. Use twice a day SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies , with a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements , attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen .
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.
There is occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities .
EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG due to:
1. Occasional left hemispheric polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of left hemispheric cerebral dysfunction.
