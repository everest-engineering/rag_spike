LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman who presents with a questionable seizure activity while in dialysis.  Past medical history is significant for end stage renal disease on dialysis, HIV, hypertension, coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, linezolid, Bactrim.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude, polymorphic 8-9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is unstable.  Throughout the majority of the recording the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta, alpha and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.

FINDINGS:
1. Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
2. No sleep.
3. No epileptiform discharges.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse generalized slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific cerebral dysfunction. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
