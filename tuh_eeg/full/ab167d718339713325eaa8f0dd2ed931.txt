right, past history of seizures now with obtundation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Keppra
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  There is a great deal of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow theta pattern.  There is more rhythmic 5 Hz activity on the left and more muscle on the right. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle.  Heart rate 84 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:   This EEG supports a bilateral disturbance of cerebral function.  The asymmetry described above may be artifactual.
