CLINICAL HISTORY:  An adult male status post fall with 20 to 25 minutes loss of consciousness and  incontinence.  Past history of hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, Parkinson disease, depression and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the  bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This patient had a fair amount of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a 7 Hz alpha rhythm. __________ and a small amount of background slowing.  As the patient becomes drowsy, she has a decrease in muscle artifact and a bit more of theta.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically somewhat challenging EEG due to the degree of muscle artifact on this bedside EEG, but it is abnormal due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no definitive focal features noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a more prolonged study may be obtained in the lab capturing the upper stages of sleep.  In this individual with a chronic, neurological disorder and metabolic features, the features described above with generalized background slowing and some shifting showing may be attributed to his many problems.
