CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, seizures
characterized by an aura of the taste of paint.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Topamax, Zoloft.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm ranging from 8.5 to 9.5 Hz. There is a
small amount of excess theta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in
background slowing with POSTS and vertex waves. Photic stimulation is performed
while the patient is in stage I sleep and stage II sleep, but there is a scant driving
response. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the overall
background.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganized pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features have been identified in the 2
EEGs that this patient has completed. The background slowing and disorganization are
nonspecific findings, supporting a bihemispheric disturbance in cerebral function. This
patient's medications may play a role in the patterns described above. If additional
information is needed, a follow-up study-capturing one of her events is suggested.
