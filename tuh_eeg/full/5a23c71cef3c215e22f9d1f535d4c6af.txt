CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old woman with HIV, hypertension, diabetes admitted today for witnessed seizure that appeared subsequently, patient had bilateral arm shaking without loss of consciousness or postictal confusion.

MEDICATIONS:  Ambien, iron, Benadryl, Colace, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient had some shakiness in the right arm but the video was reviewed and it was difficult to see the arm shaking.

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES RECORD:  Problems with impedance as well as difficulty getting the patient to relax.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation did not activate the record. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Intermittent, rhythmic slowing was noted.

HR:    130 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, rhythmic background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG, August 23, this EEG is significantly improved.  The background has improved significantly.  The intermittent, rhythmic slowing is a nonspecific finding and may be related to this patient's underlying CNS problems.
