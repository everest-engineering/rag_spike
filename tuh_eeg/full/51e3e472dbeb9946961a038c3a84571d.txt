CLINICAL HISTORY:  Persistent unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was unresponsive during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This brief EEG demonstrates an awake and drowsy record with in wakefulness a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
The patient was informed that he was going to have continuous video EEG monitoring.  During the EEG, before 20 minutes of routine EEG, recording could be completed, the patient refused further testing and removed the electrodes from his scalp.
Heart rate 76 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited record, for an unresponsive patient demonstrated a normal awake pattern.  These findings suggest that this problem may be behavioral or emotional rather than biological in nature.
