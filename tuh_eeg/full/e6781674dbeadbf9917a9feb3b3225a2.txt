CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old woman with a change in mental status, heart failure
and seizures. The patient awoke confused and had a seizure en route to the emergency
department on 2/13/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan, Pantoprazole, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
appears uncomfortable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing beings, the EEG demonstrates all
muscle artifact as might be anticipated in a tense patient. The technologist attempts to
use a filter with little benefit. Toward the end of the record as she starts to become a
little drowsy, this is some delta noted in the background. Stimulation of the patient did
not activate the record.
HR: 66bpm.
IMPRESSION: Very limited EEG due to:
1. Obscuration of the background with diffuse muscle artifact.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional EEG recording may be helpful to more
completely characterize this patient's epileptiform activity. In addition, given the features
described above, it may be valuable to have a more comprehensive assessment of this
patient's cerebral activity.
