CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male with aphasia, spinal cord and diffuse brain disorder, status post MVA in 1990, baclofen pump. The patient has episodes of loss of consciousness, hypersomnolence and syncope. Multiple previous EEG monitors have been unremarkable.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Tegretol
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Technical quality was remarkable primarily for a great deal of muscle artifact. There was 1 push button event at 8:15 p.m. while the patient was awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
AWAKE AND SLEEP RECORDING:  In wakefulness, there is a great deal of muscle artifact and generous beta. Intermittent rhythmic theta was noted.
Sleep recording is remarkable for a markedly slow pattern without waveforms of stage 2 sleep including spindle. There are mild asymmetries noted in stage 2 sleep.
INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DETECTIONS:  None.
EPILEPTIFORM SEIZURES:  None.
PUSH BUTTON EVENTS:  Time 8:14: The patient is awake. No epileptiform features were identified.
HEART RATE:  78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:
This 24 hours of EEG recording was remarkable for generalized background slowing.
Excess theta.
A single push button while the patient was awake was not associated with an EEG signature.
