CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 75 -year-old woman with encephalopathy, agitation, screaming during her sleep and diffuse body pain.  Past history of dialysis, diabetes, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was very agitated and upset.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is relatively low voltage, slow and disorganized.  There are bursts of generalized background slowing.  In addition, there are occasional, isolated bursts of focal slowing in the left hemisphere.  The overall EEG is low voltage with a mixture of some posterior delta, beta and theta.
The patient is noted to talk to herself during the EEG and is difficult to console.
Heart rate somewhat irregular:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
A low voltage pattern.
Bursts of rhythmic slowing, a little bit more so on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  There are a few more bursts of rhythmic slowing on the left than the right.  These may be correlated with imaging.
