CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 35-year-old woman with history of Sturge-Weber, multiple somatic complaints, carpal tunnel syndrome, memory loss, confusion, concussion with facial paresthesias for 10 years.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Xanax, Seroquel, lithium, others.

I INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
This is an awake stage 2 sleep.  It is a technically satisfactory record for a patient who has intermittent shivering or twitching during the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 10.5 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta, and a small amount of muscle.  Drowsiness was characterized by rhythmic theta with rhythmic slowing noted in the background and vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS in stage 2 sleep. Intermittent twitch artifact was noted in wakefulness and in sleep and on some occasions seem to disrupt the patient's asleep. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was transitioning into deeper stages of sleep and did not activate the record. Hyperventilation did not activate the record.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Of note, the muscle twitch artifact noted in wakefulness and sleep did not carry an EEG signature.
