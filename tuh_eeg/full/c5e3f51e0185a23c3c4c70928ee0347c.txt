AGE: 44 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient
EEG TYPE: Routine, awake-only EEG #: 13474978001315
HISTORY:
44 y.o. male with a history of seizures and schizophrenia undergoing a follow-up EEG.	He also has a history of being stabbed in the head in 2003 and constant headaches.
MEDICATIONS:
Klonopin, abilify, nortriptyline, remeron, MVI SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel
of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
Drowsiness and sleep are not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-only routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-only routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
