Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,  10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. Hr was 60 technical difficulties: Prominent sweat artifact was noted.

Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures

Interpretation:
This is a limited NORMAL EEG, mainly awake with short lasting drowsiness.
