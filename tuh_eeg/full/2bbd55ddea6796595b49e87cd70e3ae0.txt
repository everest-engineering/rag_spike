CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old right handed male with right-sided weakness and
shakiness for 1 year.
MEDICATIONS: Fluocinonide, Lisinopril, Carvedilol, Albuterol, Lasix, Aspirin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 1 hour EEG with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta and a small amount of theta. In the transition to drowsiness, there is shifting slowing, left more so than the right. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. The record includes generous sleep with transition in and out of stage I sleep. Snore artifact is observed. There is little stage II sleep.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
I. Mild background slowing.
2. Mild excess theta.
3. Shifting slowing more so on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings can be seen in the context of adult onset cognitive disorders or following ischemic cerebrovascular pathology. No epileptiform features were observed.
