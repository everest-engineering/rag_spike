CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old obtundation, intracerebral hemorrhage and large PCA infarct
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Pantoprazole, Metoprolol, Labetolol, Zosyn, Vancomycin, Cardizem, ASA, Lisinopril, Zocor, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a face mask and is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern with theta and delta activity. There is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant and a bit more sharply contoured slowly in the left temporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces increase in faster frequency activity.
84bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is not significantly different than the previous study on 1/30/2011. There are bihemispheric features with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere and a bit more sharply contoured slowly in the left but no seizures were recorded.
