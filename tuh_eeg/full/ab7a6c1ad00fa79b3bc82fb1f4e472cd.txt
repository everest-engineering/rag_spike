History:	29 year old woman with a history of seizures since 17 years old.  Last seizure
occurred yesterday.
Medications:	DILANTIN, TRAZODONE, SEROQUEL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Alpha variant, fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 42-minute EEG, awake -only.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
