CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old left handed man found with change in mental status and a new right MCA stroke with a baseline old left MCA stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol, ASA, Plavix, Captopril.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while obtunded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some C4 electrode artifact seen intermittently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a slow disorganized background with a slow posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 8 Hz.  There is no normal frontocentral beta seen continuously throughout the recording.  The patient does not appear to sleep and no normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen independently at F7/C3 and F8/T4 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.  Please note that over the F8/T4, there is a slight suppression of amplitude, especially seen in the T4 electrodes with a much lower amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing and with decreased amplitude over the right anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the previous stroke and known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
