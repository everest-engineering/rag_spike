CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 33-year-old male, status post PEA code on September 28th with hypothermic treatments.  EEG monitoring on October 1st.  Follow up study for myoclonic jerks.
MEDICATIONS:  Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cefepime, and Flagyl.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient was intubated, comatose and not responsive.  The patient had returned to euthermia.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a low voltage, markedly suppressed pattern.  There is a slow periodic complex seen with 1 complex every 1-3 seconds.  The complexes of bifrontal, simple in morphology on most occasions, but alternates with a more bifid appearance.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produced eye flutter, but no real change in the background EEG and no change in the slow, bifrontal, somewhat generalized periodic complexes.
Heart rate 130 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG, recorded 4 days after cardiac arrest, in the absence of sedative-hypnotic medications, due to:
Markedly suppressed background.
Very slow periodic complex.
Absence of significant reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to the 2 previous studies, there is no sustained epileptiform activity and the periodic complexes are slowing in periodicity.  These findings may be correlated with the overall clinical picture.
