CLINICAL HISTORY: Schizophrenia, memory loss.
MEDICATIONS: Geodon, simvastatin, benztropine, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, background EEG is well organized
with 10 hertz, 30-50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces some artifact in the
temporal electrodes. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Prolonged sleep includes vertex waves, spindles and POSTS.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Heart rate is 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This prolonged outpatient sleep deprived EEG was
remarkable for:
1. Normal wakefulness through stage II sleep.
2. No epileptiform features were seen. The artifacts described did not subtract from
the study.
