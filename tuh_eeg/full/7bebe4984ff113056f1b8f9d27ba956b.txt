CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  During this 24-hour section, the patient had none of his typical convulsive seizures.  He reported some weird feelings in his left foot.  The nurses noted that he was intermittently tearful.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Random wakefulness and sleepy wakefulness:  Much of the record includes a well-organized background with measured alpha rhythm.  Particularly drowsiness, rhythmic slowing is noted from the right hemisphere.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted through stage II sleep.
The focal slowing is a little bit more prominent in the transition in and out of sleep.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
The patient tends to pick at his EEG electrodes but by the 29th the quality of the EEG electrodes is quite good.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 24-hour section of the EEG recording did not identify any epileptiform seizures or any behaviors that looked like a convulsive seizure.
