CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed female with a past medical history of bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, asthma, and panic attacks.  She complained of an episode of anxiety for 30 minutes, pulsing in the head, bilateral upper extremity shaking which can be controlled by the patient.  The patient is following commands during the episodes.
MEDICATIONS:  Acyclovir, Omeprazole, Thiamine, Albuterol, Loratadine, Imitrex, Vistaril, and occasional Xanax.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system, additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is excessive amount of frontal central beta seen throughout the recording, which is not necessarily abnormal and could be caused by medication use. The patient appears to go to stage I sleep.   Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Note:  An excessive amount of beta can be seen with the use of barbiturates or benzodiazepines, and not necessarily abnormal features in EEG recordings.
