REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old man with history of CAD status post percutaneous inflation in 2006, factor V deficiency, hypertension, DVT, seizure disorder, who presented with chest pain and episodes of upper extremity generalized movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Protonix, Percocet and Benadryl.  Please note that Keppra was decreased and Dilantin was decreased during the admission.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded with wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software as well as nurses' notes and patient's alarm were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Heart rate was 78.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Infrequent focal slowing seen at T3 with frequency of 2-4 Hz at amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES OR EVENTS:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that no more events like the one captured on video on day 1 were captured on the rest of the recording.
