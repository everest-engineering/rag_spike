History:	20 year old woman with a progressive decline in mental status.  As per report, a
prior EEG showed epileptiform activity.
Medications:	Vancomycin, Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
This is a technically limited EEG due to nearly constant eye movement that results in large
amplitude anterior artifact.  With eyes closed, the background consists of low-to-moderate
amplitude fast activity, poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic low amplitude theta and delta
activity.  With eyes opened, the background voltages are low and the background consists of a
mixture of excess beta, theta and delta activity.  Patient remain awake throughout the recording.
No appreciable focal features are captured.  No clear epileptiform discharges are seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Beta, excessive
Technically limited
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED EEG due to frequent movement artifact and eye movement
artifact. Otherwise the background is moderately diffusely slow burst clearly reactive.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Patient will be
placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
