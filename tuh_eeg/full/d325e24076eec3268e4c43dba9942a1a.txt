History:	51 year old man status post anoxic brain injury, now with episodes of facial
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of burst-suppression, with variable burst-
suppression ratio.  Bursts generally last ~1 second with some intervals of suppression lasting up to
50 seconds.  Clinically, bursts are associated with complex facial movements/ twitching and eye
opening.  Electrographically, bursts contain high amplitude sharply contoured theta and delta
activity and intense EMG artifact.  There is a subtle generalized occipitally predominant spike and
wave discharge at the beginning of each burst, but due to presence of  EMG artifact, presence of
this spine and wave is not certain.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  No paralytic agent is administered during the
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern
Other, episodes of facial movements correspond to bursts of activity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 28 min  EEG due to severe burst-suppression pattern with bursts of
activity that correlate with clinical facial movements/ twitching/ eye opening and contain sharply
contoured activity and suspected generalized epileptiform discharges.  These findings indicate
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction and increase cortical irritability.  Patient was placed on
