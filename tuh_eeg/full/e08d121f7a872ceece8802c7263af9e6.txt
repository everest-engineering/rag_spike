History:	65 year old woman with a history of DM, had an episode concerning for a seizure.
Patient reportedly woke up in am and had generalized shaking.  Patient's
consciousness was not affected.  She has been under significant amount of stress
Medications:	Xanax, Glyburide, Prilosec
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The background consists of low amplitude diffuse low amplitude beta activity.  Rare 10 Hz PDR is
seen.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 24-minute EEG. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
