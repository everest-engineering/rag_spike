CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of likely complex partial seizures currently admitted for presurgical evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lyrica 150 mg b.i.d. and Vimpat 100 mg in the a.m. and then off.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated amplitude to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves, sleep spindles, escape complexes, slow wave sleep, and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is observed over the left temporal region.  Additional monomorphic theta activity is captured over the left temporal region during wakefulness and it disappears during sleep.  Intermittent bradycardia is noted in the single EKG leads.
FINDINGS:
Occasional mild left temporal slowing.
No events.
No seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 24-hour continuous audiovisual EEG monitoring due to occasional mild left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  No electrographic seizures were captured and no events occurred.
