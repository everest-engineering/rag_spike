Event time 7:51:  The patient is awake.  The background demonstrates a theta pattern.  No epileptiform features were noted.
Random wakefulness and sleep:  This section of the record includes a diffusely slow pattern.  There is some sections of the record where there is significantly more rhythmic, bifrontal theta.
In sleep, there are occasional bursts of fast activity in the frontal regions, left more so than the right.
In addition, on one occasion there is a burst of 12 Hz activity in the right frontal region in sleep.
During this section of the record the patient reported that he had 3 seizures.  He did not push the button.  No clinical events were noted by the nursing team.
