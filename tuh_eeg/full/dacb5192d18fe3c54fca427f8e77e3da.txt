DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the record includes stage I and stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and posts.   The patient is awakened for photic stimulation and has limited wakefulness.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed.  The primarily sleep EEG could be due to sleep deprivation or other disturbances like hypersomnolence, or even a sleep-deprived EEG. There are no epileptiform features.
