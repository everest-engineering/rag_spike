HISTORY:  A 21-year-old male with anaplastic ependymoma, status post multiple resections, Gamma Knife, and radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy.  The patient has recurrent tumor and presents with staring spells and generalized weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Impedances were generally lower than 5 kilohms and left frontal craniotomy defect was noted.  Three clinical seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  From the right hemisphere, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of excess theta and a small amount of beta.  The left hemisphere demonstrates frontally predominant arrhythmic delta activity and a breach rhythm.  Three seizures were recorded.  These are characterized by repetitive sharp activity in the left frontal region with frequency evolution.  Seizure duration 1 minute 20 seconds ranging to 1 minute 40 seconds.  During the seizures, the patient can answer questions, but answers them slowly.  As the recording continues, arrhythmic delta activity and occasional frontal sharp waves were noted.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Four left frontal seizures characterized by a slowing of the patient's language.
Arrhythmic delta activity from the left frontal region.
Left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Thus, EEG demonstrates repetitive seizures, compatible with focal status epilepticus.  Based on this finding, the patient was transferred to the EEG monitoring unit for intravenous therapy with seizure medications.
