CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with tonoclonic seizures lasting 2 to 5 minutes. The last seizure was a month ago. Epilepsy since age 15. Past history of alcohol dependence.

MEDICATION: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is quite drowsy with a relatively low voltage record. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record. This produces an increase in amplitude in the background with a low voltage 10Hz alpha rhythm. Shifting slowing, some of which is sharply contoured, is seen in either temporal region but there is a little more rhythmic slowing in the left temporal region and some sharply contoured left temporal slowing noted in hyperventilation. Following hyperventilation, rare T3 and T1 maximum sharp waves are observed. Epileptiform activity continues into stage II sleep with left anterior temporal spikes and sharps. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: N/A

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. left anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes, picked up primarily in hyperventilation and sleep.
2. Occasional shifting slowing on left more so than right in hyperventilation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
