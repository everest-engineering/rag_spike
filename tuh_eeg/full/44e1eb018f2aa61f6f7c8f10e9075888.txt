CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old woman admitted with multiple seizures and metabolic abnormalities. Patient was noted to have nausea and vomiting prior to the EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Tricor, Motrin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of excess theta and a small amount of disorganization. Prominent temporal wicket is noted. There is also a great deal of eye movement artifact. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
2. Mild disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a previous EEG earlier this month, this EEG is better organized. Neither EEG demonstrated epileptiform activity.
