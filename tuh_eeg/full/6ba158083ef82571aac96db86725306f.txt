CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 75-year-old woman admitted on January 4th, after she fell out of bed and had tonic clonic seizure in emergency room.  Alzheimer disease, aortic aneurysm.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: Twenty minute Digital video EEG is performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  The patient was reasonably cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG has been replaced with a lower voltage, mixed frequency, relatively featureless pattern.  On occasion, there is a glimpse of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm, better identified on the left compared to the right.  The patient was upset and crying during portions of the record with a lower voltage more organized pattern on the little bit more alpha frequency, sometimes identified bilaterally.  Features of drowsiness included an increase in background slowing.  Occasional shifting slowing was noted.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Paucity of the normal waveforms anticipated for an adult of this age in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The absence of epileptiform activity does not exclude a diagnoses of epilepsy or reactive seizure.  If epilepsy is an ongoing consideration a followup study capturing sleep may be a value.
