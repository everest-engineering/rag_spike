History:	23 YR OLD FEMALE R HANDED. PT HAD LIVER TRANSPLANT AT 8 MONTHS AT
THAT TIME PT. STARTED HAVING SZ. EYES
ROLLING,SHAKING,INCONTINENCE,BODY STIFFENS. POST ICTAL SLEEPY. PT
ALSO H/O ASTHMA.
Medications:	Zonisamide, oxcarbazepine, tranxene, keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 6.5Hz  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  There was some central superimposed beta noted at times.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent brief bursts (15 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal
slow spike-and-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of 2.0-2.5 Hz.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, slow, intermittent diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent bursts of generalized slow spike-and-wave.
These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy or
epileptogenic encephalopathy. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
