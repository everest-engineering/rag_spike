History:	75 Y/O FEMALE  ON HER WAY TO DIALYSIS,FOUND HER COLLAPSED IN THE
STREET.THE EMS SHOCKED HER ONCE AND GAVE EPI. CPR PERFORMED BY
EMS WAS DEFIBRILLATED TIMES 1. COMPRESSION BEGAN PRIOR TO ARRIVAL
Medications:	INSULIN, HEPARIN, BENADRYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by burst
suppression pattern.  Burst consist of a sudden generalized frontocentral predominant sharply
countoured alpha discharge that decreases in frequency to theta and then delta. They last around
10-20 seconds. This pattern was best seen after vecuronium was administered.  This pattern had an
associated sudden body jerk with the onset.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 120  Technical difficulties:Diffuse muscle artifact seen until
vecuronium was given.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, associated body jerk (myoclonus) with onset of burst.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background attenuation and burst suppression
pattern. The associated myoclonus at the onset of the burst and evolution is suggestive of an
epileptogenic nature for the discharges.  All the findings are supportive for severe cortical
dysfunction and irritability which in the setting of an anoxic injury carries a poor prognosis.
