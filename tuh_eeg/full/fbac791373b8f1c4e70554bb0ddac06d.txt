CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old right handed woman, disabled following a stroke and found unresponsive on the 18th with confusion.

MEDICATIONS: Simvastatin, Tylenol #3, Calcium, Multi-Vit

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage, but there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm identified with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Prominent wicket is observed. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and some of the wicket activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 56 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. A low voltage pattern is not pathological.
