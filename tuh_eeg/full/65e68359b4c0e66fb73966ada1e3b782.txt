LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of HIV and COPD who now presents with shortness of breath, found to have DKA and pneumonia.  More recently the patient had an acute change in mental status, not following commands, with gaze preference to the left and diffuse rigidity.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Keppra and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta with intermittent periods of brief 1 to 2 second discontinuity.  Sleep spindle-like complexes are captured.  Additional continuous polymorphic delta activity is captured over the left hemisphere, most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  With noxious and verbal stimuli an additional amount of theta activity is observed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate to severe diffuse slowing.
Focal left hemispheric slowing, most pronounced over the left temporal region.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21 minute EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse slowing, and focal left hemispheric slowing, that is most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiological nonspecific cerebral dysfunction.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No clear electrographic seizures are captured.
