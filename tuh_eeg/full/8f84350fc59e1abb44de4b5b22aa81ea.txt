EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 12 hours from 02/18/2014 to 02/19/2014.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
Description: No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  As the EEG continued some reactivity and muscle artifact is noted.  Multiple electrode are lost after 10PM
HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 12 HOUR EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate  to severe diffuse
