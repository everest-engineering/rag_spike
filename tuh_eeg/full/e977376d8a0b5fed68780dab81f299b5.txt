History: 40 Y 0 MALE WITH HX: SEIZURES SINCE 2001 .7-31-13 DIAGNOSED WITH A
ARACHNOID CYST. LAST SZ 2 YRS AGO, HAVING DAILY HEADACHES IN THE
OCCIPITAL REGION.AND LT EYE FLASHES CONTINUOUS
Medications: Dilantin. Synthroid
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Waking background is characterized by a 25-35uV, 10-10.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV. beta activity is present. maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates. and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity. and symmetric steep spindles end K complexes appear.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Beta diffuse
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
