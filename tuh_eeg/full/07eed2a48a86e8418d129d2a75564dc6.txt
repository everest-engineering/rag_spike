CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old man, presents after found down with no vital signs, status post PEA code with resuscitation after 15 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol and Zosyn
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post code, unresponsiveness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely abnormal background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  The record is basically comprised of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges with a maximum frontal negativity seen at times slightly more on the left than the right at a frequency of 2.5-3 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts occurring continuously throughout the recording.  At times, there is intermixed polyspike seen in the small bursts of 400 msec to 1 second.  Throughout the recording, there appears to be no clinical correlate to these generalized periodic epileptiform discharges.  The patient is stimulated during the recording and there is no change in this pattern.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) seen continuously throughout the recording with intermittent anterior predominant polyspikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with the known hypoxic injury.  No seizures were clearly seen.
