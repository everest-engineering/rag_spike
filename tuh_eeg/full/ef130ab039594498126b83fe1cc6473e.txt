REASON FOR STUDY:  Transient weakness and confusion.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old woman with signs of left-sided weakness and slurred speech

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Risperdal, Diovan.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior, temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation produced discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Left anterior temporal F7/T3 focal slowing at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.

SEIZURES:  None.

HEART RATE:  90 with some extra ectopic beats, appeared to be atrial.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebellar dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
