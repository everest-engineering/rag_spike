CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed female with migraine headaches, doubly vision, floaters, complicated migraines.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was declined, but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There appears to be an alpha supraharmonic with both 9 and 18 hertz activity. General beta activity is noted in the background. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The background beta can be seen in intense individual. The alpha harmonic is a normal finding.
