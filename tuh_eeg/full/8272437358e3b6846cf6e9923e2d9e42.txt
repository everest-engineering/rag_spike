CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 40-year-old male with past history of mesothelioma, HIV disease with ring-enhancing right basal ganglia lesion.
MEDICATIONS:  Bactrim, multiple antibiotics and antifungals. Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record.  This was extremely technically challenging ICU record with problems with impedances, electrical interference, and the patient's scalp condition.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Intermittent, shifting slowing is noted from either hemisphere.  As the patient becomes drowsy, bursts of slowing are somewhat more prolonged from the right hemisphere.
Deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves and POSTS.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing somewhat more prominent on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Overall, this is more compatible with a bihemispheric process.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study may be a value.
