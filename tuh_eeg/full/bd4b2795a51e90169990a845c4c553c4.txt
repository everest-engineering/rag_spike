CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed female with a history of hypertension who presents with seizures since age 25, now with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Labetalol, Benazepril, Klonopin, Indapamide
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.   Sleep stage I is recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 to 9 hertz which is reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta seen. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 frequently, at times in monomorphic runs, but an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts with 2-5 hertz frequency.
Focal slow waves seen at T4 infrequently at 2-4 hertz.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hertz seen in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal frequent focal slow waves.
Independent rare right mid temporal slow waves.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction of the left anterior temporal region with additional independent dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.
In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is also nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
