CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old woman with a history of left hemispheric aneurysm clamp in 1998.  Patient admitted for episodes of blackouts since April 2003.
MEDICATIONS: Folic acid and thiamin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the Long-term EEG Monitoring Unit using standing 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: There a 10 Hz, 40 V posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasionally, subtle left temporal focal slowing is seen.
EVENTS AND RELATED ISSUES:  No spells were reported during this period of the record.  Throughout the EEG, occasional left temporal focal slowing and sometimes left temporal sharp waves can be seen.  No organized seizure activity was identified.
HR:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal focal slowing and occasional sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Over the last 24 hours of long-term monitoring, the patient reported two spells but no EEG correlates were seen.  However, the left temporal focal features may be suggestive of a structural lesion and may be responsible for a partial mechanism for epilepsy in this patient.  The initiation of antiepileptic medications is recommended for this patient.
