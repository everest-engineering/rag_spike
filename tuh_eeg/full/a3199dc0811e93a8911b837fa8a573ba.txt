CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old male for intraoperative monitoring for thrombectomy.
ROOM NUMBER:  OR 17.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, propofol, Versed.
INTRODUCTION:  The EEG recording began at 8:25 am in the morning and concluded at 2:32 pm.
A 6-hour video EEG was performed in the OR suite using standard CEA montage with 1 channel of EKG.  This study was monitored for 5.0 hours of one-to-one physician remote review.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial sections of the record demonstrate an awake individual with a symmetric reactive background.  Anesthetic medications are initiated after 8:30 and the EEG transitioned to a sleep pattern with morphology of stage II sleep.  The initial hours of the EEG recording demonstrate a light anesthetic pattern.
Cooling began at 11:00 am.  The EEG starts to transition to a flat pattern at 11:55 am and the EEG was declared as electrocerebral inactivity or flat at 12:02.  Intermittent very low frequency activity was noted intermittently.  The suppressed pattern was utilized during the operative portion of the record.
Rewarming began at 1:41 and with rewarming, the EEG returned to asymmetric, anesthetic pattern with mixed frequency background.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this operative procedure identified a suppressed cerebral pattern with the use of hypothermia at approximately noon and then return of the cerebral pattern in 1 hour and 40 minutes later.
