LENGTH OF RECORDING:  25 minutes.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 22-year-old woman who was found on the floor status post delivery, confused.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes childhood seizures and anxiety.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lamictal, and Keppra.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During very brief maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 7.5 Hz theta activity.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is unstable.  Throughout the majority of the recording, the patient remained asleep.  Sleep architecture, such as POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep).  Vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  There is diffuse excess beta throughout.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no appreciable change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
Continuous drowsiness and sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is mildly abnormal, very briefly awake and mostly drowsy and asleep 25-minute EEG.  Mild diffuse slowing indicates etiologically or nonspecific cerebral dysfunction, that in this case could be related to excessive drowsiness.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. The lack of epileptiform discharges and a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
