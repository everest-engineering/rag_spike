CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 29-year-old woman presented with two-day history of change in mental status with tox screen positive for cocaine and opioids.
MEDICATIONS:  No additional sedative hypnotic medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technically challenging record for an agitated patient.  Most impedances were below 5 kilos Ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG was diffusely slow  The alpha rhythm ranged between 7 and 8 hertz, typically approximately 60 microvolts.  Central mu activity was noted at 8 Hz, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  The patient was agitated and moving throughout the EEG.
Drowsiness was characterized by an increased in rhythmicity of the background as well as a decreased in muscle artifact.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  The background slowing was nonspecific, but can be seen with the use of sedative hypnotic medications.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
