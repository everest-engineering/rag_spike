CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old right handed woman with episodes of muscle spasms, headaches, and episodes where she freezes without loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: Tramadol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.
HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third normal EEG for this adult. If additional information is needed, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep or perhaps capturing one of her spells is suggested.
