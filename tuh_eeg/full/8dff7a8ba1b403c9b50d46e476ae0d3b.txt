CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 86-year-old with left hemisphere hematoma, dementia, and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow and disorganized.  Superimposed upon this is an intrahemispheric asymmetry.
The alpha rhythm is at best 6 Hz, sometimes disrupted on the right compared to the left.  Focal slowing is noted on the right with arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere, greater in the left, particularly in the posterior quadrant.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in slowing.  There are some bursts of sharply contoured slowing out of the left central region.
Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Rare left central sharp waves at C3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is congruent with a structural or function process on the right, through there are sharps on the left.
