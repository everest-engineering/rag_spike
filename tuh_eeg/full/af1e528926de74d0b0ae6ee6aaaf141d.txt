CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old male with long history of recurrent right visual phenomenon, left-sided weakness and numbness, diagnosed with stroke in the past several months, persistent left-sided numbness.  Carotid strings __________.
MEDICATIONS:  Sevoflurane, __________, fentanyl, Versed, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Five hour digital EEG was performed in the OR using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient has received anesthetic medications.  The background includes a pattern rich in beta.  There is also some underlying delta.  As anesthesia level waxes and wanes, there is a bit of fluctuation in quantity of beta or delta.
After the administration of anesthesia, there is an asymmetry noted prior to any surgical procedure with more delta in the right hemisphere in comparison to the left as well as disruption of fascia frequency activity in the right hemisphere.  As the levels of anesthesia wax and wane, when the EEG becomes briefly or subtly discontinuous, it is consistently more discontinuous on the right.
A relatively stable anesthetic pattern is established, but that pattern does include a focal pattern with more delta on the right particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
The patient is noted to have a lengthy stenosis extending superiorly.
The external carotid is clamped at 12:08.  The internal carotid is clamped subsequently.  No additional focal features were observed.
The carotid is unclamped at 1:47.  Patency is assessed by Doppler at 1:49.  The study concludes at 12:12.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this right carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for an asymmetry noted after induction of anesthesia, but without significant change with clamp of the carotid.
