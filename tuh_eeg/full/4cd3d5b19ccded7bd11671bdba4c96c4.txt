CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old woman with a history of chest pain and seizures with postictal confusion.  She also has a history of non-convulsive status, hypertension, asthma, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.  Overall, the background is in the delta range at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves as described above at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
