CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male post traumatic headaches with a
subdural hematoma in 2008, gunshot wound in 2009, and seizure-free for the last year.

MEDICATIONS: Celexa, Dilantin, Trazodone; Naproxen, Metoprolol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed. The patient has prominent craniotomy scars in the right
central and temporal region.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm. A
breach rhythm is identified on the right with higher amplitude beta activity in that region and very subtle low voltage delta in the right centrotemporal region. Prominent wicket is noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in the amplitude, accentuating the breach rhythm and to a slight extent the focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region. Features of drowsiness
included an increase in amplitude of the background, a small amount of wicket, and again, a slight accentuation of the focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region. Deeper stages of sleep include stage I sleep with bilateral vertex waves. Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving.

HR: 84 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Markedly improved EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
1. Now a normal pattern on the left.
2. Intermittent focal slowing in the right centrotemporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: A breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following
craniotomy. The focal slowing is in the region of his previous neurosurgery.
