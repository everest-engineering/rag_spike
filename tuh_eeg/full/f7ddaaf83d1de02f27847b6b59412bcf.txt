REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncopal episode.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 88-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension who presents to the hospital with a syncopal episode.  She was found her nephew.   She was slow to respond.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Norvasc and heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some A1 electro artifact seen continuously throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which was reactive to eye opening.  The patient has normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen occasional at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral  dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
