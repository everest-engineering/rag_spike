History:	27 YEAR OLD MALE R HANDED WITH A FLARE UP OF GASTROPARESIS.
PMHX ASTHMA,ALSO PULMONARY  DISORDER.
Medications:	Dilaudid, Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes
more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the bitemporal midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bitemporal midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta can be seen at times in the setting of benzodiazepine
and barbiturate use.
