CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old woman with left basal ganglia hemorrhage and vertebral artery aneurysm status post coil, but with subarachnoid hemorrhage and persistently high elevated ICPs.

MEDICATIONS: Vecuronium, Propofol, Midazolam, Dilantin, Gentamicin, Pantoprazole, Ceftriaxone, Nimodipine, Labetalol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has not yet received the Pentobarbital.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a lower voltage pattern. It is actually already a discontinuous pattern with attenuated pattern with bursts of attenuation lasting up to 7 seconds interrupted by bursts of more rhythmic theta. The theta frequency activity and mixture of theta and delta may be as short at 2-3 seconds in duration and occasionally, a little bit longer. It is not so much a frank burst suppression, but more intermittent attenuation pattern. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.

HR: 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A discontinuous pattern.
2. Intermittent rhythmic theta see in a burst of activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above may represent pharmacologic coma. Long term EEG monitoring was initiated as part of  protocol for burst suppression for the use of Pentobarbital.
