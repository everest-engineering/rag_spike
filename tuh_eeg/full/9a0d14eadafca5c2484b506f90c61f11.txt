INTRODUCTION: Routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode, anterior temporal electrode. The recording was performed during wakefulness as well as stage I and stage II sleep and photic stimulation was performed.
MEDICATIONS: Include mirtazapine, sertraline, amitriptyline, clonazepam, hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/500 mg.
DENTAL PROBLEMS: None.
HISTORY: A 37-year-old man who presents after being hit in the head and passing out, told bystanders that he was shaking, with poor recollection of the event.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: Record opens up to posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 1O Hz with 20 to 70 microvolts amplitude with a large amount of frontal central beta at 15 to 25 Hz and amplitude less than 10 microvolts, which is seen diffusely. Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and 2 and there is a normal response to photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: None.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG, awake and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: He is awake and sleep EEG was normal. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note that the increased amount of beta may be related to medication effect.
