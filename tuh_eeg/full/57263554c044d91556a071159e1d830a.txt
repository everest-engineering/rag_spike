INTRODUCTION:
Routine EEG performed using a 10/20 electrode placement system including EKG electrodes, awake and drowsy stages sleep. Photic stimulation was performed with no hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
None
MEDICATIONS:
Zocor, pantoprazole, insulin, Seroquel, glyburide, metformin, Lovenox, aspirin, citalopram.
HISTORY:
50-year-old male with history of multiple TIAs, diabetes, CAD, status post left CA, hypertension, increased cholesterol, bipolar disease who presents with episodes of starring and dizziness with hand movement.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 to 9Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts, which is symmetrically reactive to eye opening and closing. A beta rhythm of 15-25 Hz and less than 10 microvolts amplitude, which is maximally frontocentrally is seen in a small amount. Photic stimulation was normal. In addition, stage 1 sleep was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Generalized slow waves are present during wakefulness: Excessive theta in the 5 to 7 Hz range with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts seen moderately.
2. No seizures were seen.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG demonstrates mild cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
