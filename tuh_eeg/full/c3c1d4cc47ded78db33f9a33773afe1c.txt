:
History:	74 year old male with events of numbness on left side, slurred speech, hoarseness.
Medications:	Zonisamide, keppra, dexamethasone, insulin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with paucity of faster frequencies over the right.
The background over the left consists of 8 Hz theta posteriorly with weak AP gradient and excess
polymorphic theta activity.  The background over the right consists of occasional fragmented
unstable 7-7.5 Hz PDR, poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.  During
sleep, faster frequencies disappear and diffuse delta activity appears.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, moderate, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly asleep EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and moderate
focal right hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal right hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral
dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.
