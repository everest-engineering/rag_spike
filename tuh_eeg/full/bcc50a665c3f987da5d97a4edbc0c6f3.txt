CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, now with increasing difficulty with word finding.

MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Carbamazepine, Abilify, Cymbalta, Singulair

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. There is prominent, excessive theta noted in the background. Occasional, medium amplitude left anterior temporal sharp waves are observed. Hyperventilation is performed early on in record. There are some artifacts noted in hyperventilation but no definitive exacerbation of sharps or spikes. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Previous EEGs have demonstrated excess theta as well as the left temporal sharp waves. It is difficult to determine if quantitatively there is more theta than noted in prior studies. There are no specific hallmarks of an encephalopathy, and this patient's medications may also contribute to the theta described above.
