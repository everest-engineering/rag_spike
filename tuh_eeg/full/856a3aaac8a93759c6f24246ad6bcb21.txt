CLINICAL HISTORY:  66 year old female with esophageal cancer.	Metabolic encephalopathy.  History of seizures.  Multi-system failure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Morphine,   Furosemide,  Midazolam, Pantoprazole,  Heparin, Vancomycin, Cipro, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with rhythmic theta, bursts of FIRDA, shifting asymmetries including some sharp wave contour slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  There is variability in the record.  At times there is more rhythmic theta than others.  Occasional triphasic waves are noted in the frontal regions.
HR:	126 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Prominent background slowing.
2. 	FIRDA.
3.	Shifting slowing with triphasic waves.
4.	Some sharp wave contour discharges in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG is most supportive of an underlying toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.   No subclinical seizures were noted. The sharp waves identified from the left frontotemporal region are not prominent and may be part of his past history of epilepsy.
