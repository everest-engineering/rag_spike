CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old man right handed male with history of hypertension, CHF with episodes of loss of memory.
MEDICATIONS:  Warfarin, Carvedilol, Isosorbide, Furosemide, Aspirin, Simvastatin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of loss of consciousness
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm with 9 hertz with is reactive to eye opening. Normal frontocentral beta is seen. Sleep is characterized by stage I. Activating procedure produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen at F7/T3 at 2-4 hertz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with evidence of left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
