DIAGNOSIS:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old right-handed female with history of seizure started at age 15.  Her last seizure was on 08/14/2012 described as a generalized tonic clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Trileptal, Ambien, Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  A video EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency, 30-50 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  During wakefulness, there are 2 bursts of generalized spike and wave discharge seen frontally predominant occurring with a frequency of the 3.5-4 Hz.  These occurred in various lasting from 1-3 seconds without evolution or any clinical changes.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response without any photoparoxysmal response.  Hyperventilation was performed and resulted in symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing wakefulness due to generalized spike and wave discharges, frontally predominant seen during wakefulness with no evolution or clinical events.
The above findings are consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy in the setting of a history of seizures.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
