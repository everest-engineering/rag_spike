History: 52 YO RH FEMALE WITH CC OF STRANGE SMELLS 4 TO 5 TIMES A DAY FOR THE
LAST 6 MONTHS W/O LOC.
Medications: SLO-NIACIN. ASA, ZANAFLEX, VASOTEC, ZOCOR. MYCOLOG-II, ELAVIL. ZOMIG, COZAAR, B-12, VOLTAREN, FOLVITE. PRILOSEC. TRAMADOL,
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine. awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes. awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity Is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes m ore prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. Intermittent polymorphic  delta activity is present In the left anterior temporal region (F71T3)during wakefulness. increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
IMPRESSION: Focal slowing, polymorphic
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction In the left anterior temporal region, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
