CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old right handed woman with complex partial epilepsy, patient has had 2 seizures in the last 6 months with incontinence for which it was not clear that she had an aura.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran, Vimpat, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm identified which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is subtle focal slowing in the left mid anterior temporal region with some 5 Hz theta frequency.  Hyperventilation produces bilateral theta.  Following this as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a subtle focality with a little bit of focal slowing in the central parietal region.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in stage 2 sleep, but sleep is not sustained.   Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Some left temporal rhythmic theta.
Rare isolated left central parietal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are seen on rare occasions in this EEG.  The left temporal theta may represent a normal variant.  The subtle left central parietal focal features may carry and intermediate correlation with a functional or structural abnormality.  This is the second EEG without sharp waves or spikes.
Comparison with this patient's previous inpatient EEG session or a repeat video EEG session would be necessary to characterize epileptiform activity.
