History:	60 year old woman with unexplained frequent fall during which she remains awake.
Medications:	LAMICTAL, TOPAMAX, ABILIFY, ZOLOFT, ATIVAN, ATARAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving
at multiple flash rates.  Occasional 50-75uV, 100 msec positive sharp transients occur bilaterally
over the occipital regions during saccadic eye movements with the eyes open.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Alpha variant, fast
Sleep, stage 2, very brief
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 29-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and very briefly asleep. The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
