CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old man with history of subdural hematoma and bilateral craniectomies presents after bilateral cranioplasty with possible seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Depakote.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  The patient was lethargic and obtunded where recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording opens to a diffusely slow EEG with no posterior dominant rhythm, no frontal central beta seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen and no activating procedures are performed.  During the recording, the patient receives stimulation, which reveals no change in the frequency or pattern of the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and 20-60 mV amplitude.
Focal slow waves seen best in the right hemisphere at T4 at 2-4 Hz and 20-60 mV amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves in the right hemisphere, maximally at T4 in addition to moderate-to-severe diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal cerebral dysfunction in the right hemisphere, maximally in the right temporal region which has a high correlation with a structural lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology in this patient and may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
