INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE NOTE
Routine EEG performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior temporal
electrodes. No activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:
Intermittent T6 electrode artifact.
MEDICATIONS:
Protonix, insulin and p.r.n. labetalol.
HISTORY:
A 55-year-old male with hypertension and diabetes, noncompliant on medications with new brainstem and left cerebellar
hemorrhage.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to a diffusely slow background in the theta 5 to 7 Hz frequencies seen mainly over the frontal central
region, at times with an asymmetric appearance between the right and left hemispheres. There are intermittent periods of
less than two seconds of diffuse attenuation. No normal beta rhythm is seen. No normal sleep architecture is seen. No
activation procedures were performed. During the recording, the technician performed noxious, as well as verbal,
stimulation with no clear change in the pattern.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Diffuse slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz and 20 to 70 microvolts.
SEIZURES:
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG is consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or
epileptiform activity were seen.
