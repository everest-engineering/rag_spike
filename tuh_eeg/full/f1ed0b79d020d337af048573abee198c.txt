CLINICAL HISTORY:  60 year old right handed female with a history of right frontal hemangioma, DJD, and alcohol dependence who presents with seizures.  The last one was in October 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tramadol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and T4, independently, at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid-temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
