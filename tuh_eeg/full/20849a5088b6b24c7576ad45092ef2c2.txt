CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old male with a 15-minute tonic-clonic seizure 3 days ago.  History of recurrent tonic-clonic seizures over 4 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  It is technically satisfactory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an alpha rhythm which at times reaches 10 Hz.  In maximal wakefulness, at times the background is somewhat disorganized with some slower at 7-8 Hz activity mixed in the posterior dominant rhythm, and some background theta.  There is also some shifting slowing, some of which is quite subtle.  There are rare bursts of somewhat irregular sharp waves or sharply contoured slowing noted in the left hemisphere with variable maximum, but more typically T3, T5 or T1.
As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there is an increase in background slowing and some shifting slowing, again left mid to posterior temporal region.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A somewhat slow and disorganized pattern for an adult of this age.
Shifting slowing.
Underlying sharp waves in the left hemisphere with more typically mid or posterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  No seizures were recorded.  In that this may be a postictal record, a follow-up study may be of value.
