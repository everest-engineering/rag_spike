Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F7/T1.  These occurred in runs at time lasting for about a minute.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the
left fronto temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy.
