History:	52 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND DOWN IN FIELD W/
ASYSTOLE. PT HAD C/C OF WORSENING ASTHMA, WALKED UP A FLIGHT OF
STAIRS COMPLAINED OF BREATHING THEN COLLAPSED.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PROPOFOL DRIP, 5 MG OF VEC
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by generalized
(frontally-maximal) periodic (1 to 2 Hz) epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) with at times some
intermixed delta and theta diffuse slowing. Along with GPEDs the patient had associated eye
movements.  Vecuronium was given and the muscle dissipated, the GPEDs could be clearly seen.
There is also intermittent attenuation (1-3 secs) and absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), frequent diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Attenuation, frequent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  Generalized periodic discharge, diffuse background
slowing and attenuation. The combination of findings are suggestive of  diffuse cortical irritability
and dysfunction.  In the setting of hypoxic injury it forebodes a poor prognosis.
