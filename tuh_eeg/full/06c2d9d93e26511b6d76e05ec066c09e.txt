CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old found unresponsive in her kitchen, suffered a generalized tonic-clonic seizure of 30 seconds' duration en route to hospital.  Eyes deviated to the right.  Past left MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Versed, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with diffuse beta and bursts of spindles.  In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity and the beta drops out for a burst of arrhythmic delta activity.  The arrhythmic delta activity is somewhat more remarkable on the right, and there is subtle underlying sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior occipital region as well as a bit more attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right relative to the left.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in rhythmic theta.  As the recording continues, the background EEG is richer in both beta and theta.  The initial asymmetry is a bit less prominent.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a dynamic but abnormal EEG due to:
Initial markedly slow pattern with intermittent paroxysmal beta.
At the end of the record, the EEG remains quite slow, but there is an increase in beta and a decrease in the arrhythmic delta activity.
An asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity in the right posterior quadrant.
Some sharply contoured slowing in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The postictal state and the use of sedative hypnotic medications may play a role in the marked background slowing and the beta in this record.  No seizures were recorded.  The arrhythmic delta activity may be correlated with imaging.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing is suggested, given the sharply contoured slowing described above.
