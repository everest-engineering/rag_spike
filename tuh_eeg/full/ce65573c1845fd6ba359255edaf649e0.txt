CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male with schizophrenia, hospitalized for 1 month after hyperglycemic state with persistent encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Haldol, insulin. Others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at bedside with patient in isolation using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1  channel of EKG. The patient becomes extremely agitated during the EEG and prohibits adequate completion of the study despite a request for 2 mg of Haldol.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a rhythmically slow pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 7 Hz.
Heart rate is 66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may be due to the metabolic insults, hyponatremia, or other preexisting chronic neurologic problems.
