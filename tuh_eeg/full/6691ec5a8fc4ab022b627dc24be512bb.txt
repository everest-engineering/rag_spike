CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old woman with a history of a left temporal ganglioglioma status post resection in 2009, with seizures in the past 7 months described as having eye twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Diovan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1, stage sleep 2.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient easily and rapidly goes into stage 2 sleep in less than 10 seconds and activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts in addition a breach rhythm seen in that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing and breach rhythm in the left midtemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is consistent with a known surgery and tumor resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the patient did appear to easily go to sleep during the recording and clinical consideration for a sleep study is warranted.
