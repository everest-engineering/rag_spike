REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old man admitted with abdominal pain status post abdominal surgery who was oriented and following.  Now he is confused with a change in mental status with a past medical history of hypertension and left MCA infarct based on MRI findings.
MEDICATIONS:  Doxazosin, metoprolol, bacitracin, morphine p.r.n., heparin subcutaneously, famotidine, Zosyn, Zofran and micafungin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while minimally responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an abnormal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall the background consists of mainly theta and delta frequencies.  Although at times there appears to be some muscle reactivity it does not really improve in frequency.  The EEG does not reveal any normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slow waves mainly at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
