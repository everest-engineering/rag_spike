History:	22 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF CEREBRAL PALSY, BORN WITH BLOT IN BRAIN
EXTREME PREMI 6 MONTHS..  MOM CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY EEG. JUST CAME
HERE FROM FLORIDA AND GETTING WORK UP.  NEVER HAS HAD H/O SEIZURES
Medications:	BACLOFEN PUMP
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 110
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
