CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male involved in a motor vehicle accident with tree, multiple facial fractures.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Tylenol, Haldol, Motrin, Lorazepam, Propranolol, Fentanyl, Inderal

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates diffuse background slowing with a rhythmic theta frequency pattern. The patient is noted to move his legs spontaneously and at that point there is an increase to theta with a faster theta frequency activity. Despite this slow voltage flow record, the patient squeezes his wife's hand to command. There are also some sections of the record with eye movement and an increase in beta frequency activity.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with primarily a theta frequency background.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both grey and white matter. No epileptiform features were seen. If epilepsy is an important consideration, please repeat a study in the coming weeks.
