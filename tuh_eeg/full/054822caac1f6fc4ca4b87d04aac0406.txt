CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old left handed woman admitted on the 27th with delirium following endoscopy.  The patient required 420 mg of propofol.  Past gastric bypass surgery, depression, and leukemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Haldol, Ativan, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a relatively low-voltage pattern with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and frontocentrally predominant beta.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta followed by Vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
A low-voltage pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The features described above are nonspecific and may be due to this patient's medications.  A low-voltage pattern is not pathological in a young adult, and the beta may only reflect medications other than an underlying brain disorder.
