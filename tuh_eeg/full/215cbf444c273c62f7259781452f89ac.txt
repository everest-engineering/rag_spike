LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  1 hour and 32 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 22-year-old woman with past medical history of drug abuse and depression.  As per history, the patient was at a friend's house doing heroin when she became unresponsive.  This unresponsiveness might have lasted up to 8 minutes. The study was converted to a brain death study protocol in the second half of the recording.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  At the voltage of 2 microvolts/minute, there is no clear discernible brain activity.  There is occasional single lead artifact affecting C3 leads and F7 electrode. The etiology of this activity is not clear.  There was no change in the background to noxious auditory or visual stimuli.
IMPRESSION:  No clear cerebral activity.
FINDINGS:
This is a very abnormal greater than 1 hour EEG due to no clear cerebral activity
identified.  However, this EEG is not diagnostic of electrocerebral silence due to occasional activity observed in several leads of unclear etiology.
