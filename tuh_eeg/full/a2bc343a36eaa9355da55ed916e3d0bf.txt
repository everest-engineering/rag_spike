INTRODUCTION: During this section of the EEG, the patient remains clinically unchanged.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: He is awake, alert, mildly aphasic, and occasionally perseverative.  When examined at the bedside, as demonstrated in this video, he has involuntary, focal jerking of muscles in the right leg or right arm.  Those in the right are slightly faster in the leg jerk and the focal, myoclonus is not always synchronous with the arm.
While there are some problems with the quality of the recording, the technologist confirms that the electrodes are intact.  The EEG in the AM on 4/18 does show a diffusely slow pattern with theta and delta, but the periodic discharges that were high amplitude and maximum in the central parietal regions, are decreasing in amplitude and severity.  There are portions of the record that are free of the discharges with the ongoing focal jerk of the leg.
HR:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: Overall the EEG pattern is improving.  The patient appears to be relatively stable and as the epileptiform activity decreases in amplitude and frequency.   The epileptiform activity is markedly improved although the motor activity persists.
