CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old left handed woman with nocturnal seizures and staring spells.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrocodone, Effexor, Amlodipine, Gabapentin, Glipizide, Actos, Omeprazole, Pravastatin, Venlafaxine

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not done.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a pattern with generous theta. With stimulation the patient alerts with a well organized, 9.5 Hz 30 mV alpha rhythm.  She rapidly drifts off to sleep.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in sleep. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is some technical issues with this record.  Eye movements are not entirely symmetric and lead placement should be confirmed.
