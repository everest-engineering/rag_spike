CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed woman with episode of loss of consciousness and generalized shaking. Recurrent loss of consciousness over the last 2 months. Hypothyroidism, hypertension, Xanax and alcohol dependence. Nonadherent to medication regimen.
MEDICATIONS: lisinopril, synthroid, lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video eeg was performed in lab using stand 10 20 electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is scant 7 Hz theta noted in the background.  Hyper ventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving response at intermediate and flasher frequencies. Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSIONS: Very abnormal EEG due to
1. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The background theta is nonspecific finding and can be due to this patient's medications or thyroid disease.
