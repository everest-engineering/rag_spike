History:	85 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS FOUND
DOWN AT HOME, LAST SEEN NORMAL 2PM. PT NOTED WITH RESPIRATORY
DIFFICULTY/LABOR BREATHING. RT CLAVICLE FX, CT HEAD NEG.
Medications:	PROPOFOL, HEPARIN, FENTANYL, FOLIC ACID, THIAMINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 120 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
