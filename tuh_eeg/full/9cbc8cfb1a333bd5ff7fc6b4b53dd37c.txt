History:	66 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH HTN TAKEN TO ED ON 4/26/WITH SOB.
Medications:	HEPARIN, METOPROLOL, NEBULIZER
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose


Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There is a continuous rhythmic ventilator artifact noted mainly over the temporal leads.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of marked diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
