LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Nearly 23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old male with a history of seizures since the age of 3 years of age.  Seizures are described as lack of aura, and generalized tonic/clonic convulsions followed by prolonged post-ictal period.  The patient was previously on Depakote, however, he stopped it approximately 1 year ago.  In the last month he had 2 typical events while off all of his antibiotic medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate started on 1/15/2013.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and produces bursts of diffuse delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in definitive occipital driving.  Throughout the recording frequent high amplitude frontally predominant generalized spike and wave complexes as well as occasional poly spike and wave complexes are captured.  They occur in brief bursts at approximately 3.5 to 4 Hz.  The longest such burst is approximately 3 seconds.
FINDINGS:  3.5 to 4 Hz frontally predominant generalized spike and wave discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to intermittent generalized frontally predominant spike and wave discharges.  In a proper clinical context, this EEG is suggestive of generalized mechanism epilepsy.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
