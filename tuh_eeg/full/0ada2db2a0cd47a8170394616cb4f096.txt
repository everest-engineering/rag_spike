TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with 20-60 mV amplitude, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta seen. Sleep is characterized by stage 1.  Photic stimulation does not reveal any abnormal discharges.
