History:	49 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS ON 7/7/14 WITH H/O APHASIA X 1 DAY, R/O TIA.
PMHX SIG FOR CVA WITH RESID LT SIDED WEAKNESS, HTN, DM, HLD.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a poorly developed anterior posterior gradient with a PDR of
8Hz which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  There is excess 6-7Hz theta activity during
wakefulness.  There are loss of faster frequencies on the right side.  Diffuse EMG artifact noted
during most of the recording.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 80
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  intermittent focal slowing in the right temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
