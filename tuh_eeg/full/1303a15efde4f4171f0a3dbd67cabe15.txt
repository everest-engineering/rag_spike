Length of the recording is nearly 22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 26-year-old man with symptomatic generalized epilepsy who presents for followup.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Zyprexa, Celexa, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No sleep was captured.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by brief bursts of diffuse theta and delta activity.  There is occasional independence and synchronous theta activity observed over the bitemporal regions.  Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
Occasional bitemporal mild focal slowing.
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal awake and briefly drowsy 22-minute EEG due to occasional independent and synchronous mild temporal slowing.  This finding could indicate structural abnormality over the bitemporal regions.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, However stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
