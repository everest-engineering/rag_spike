CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed female with having a seizure in the
context of sleep deprivation, seizure characterized by left facial twitching followed by
generalized activity. The date of the seizure was 01/03/2010.
MEDICATIONS: Ambien, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record in an individual who is
complaining of significant sleep deprivation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominate
rhythm, but the overall background includes excess theta and beta. I believe artifact is
noted. In addition, there is some rhythmic delta noted which is a bit more prominent in
the right mid to posterior temporal region than the left. Features of drowsiness included
an increase in beta. Hyperventilation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
3. Rhythmic, right greater than left temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's extreme sleep deprivation could contribute
to the theta and beta described above. The temporal abnormalities, however, should be
in this individual with 2 lifetime seizures, they would be correlated with imaging. The
excess beta could be due to medication.
