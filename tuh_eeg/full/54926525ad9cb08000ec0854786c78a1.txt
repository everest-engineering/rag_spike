History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON 52 YR OLD MALE  WITH H/O NEW ONSET OF SZ  EPISODE
ON 8/18/13, PT REPORTS LOC W/TONGUE BITING AND POSTICTAL
CONFUSION, DENIES AURA, PRIOR TO EVENT. DENIES ANY PAST SZ/ LOC
EPISODES. PMHX SIG FOR HLD// PT DENIES ANY NEW/RECENT SZ ACTIVITY
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1 hr EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
