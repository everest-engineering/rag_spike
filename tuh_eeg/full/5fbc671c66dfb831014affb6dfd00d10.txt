CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 78-year-old male with cardiac ablation, left-sided infarct, declining mental status, mass of left MCA infarct with associated right ACA infarct, intubated, comatose, not able to move the right.
MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone, Benadryl, Cardura, insulin, Lasix, metoprolol, and morphine.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a low voltage, overall suppressed pattern, which is featureless with smaller amounts of delta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a theta pattern.  In addition, there is sharply contoured activity or sharp waves noted typically at C4, occasionally with more of a spread to F8 or Cz.
Tactile stimulation of the patient produces a small increase in faster frequency on the right hemisphere and may slightly accentuate epileptiform activity at F8 and C4.
Overall, the activity in the right hemisphere is markedly rhythmic with a clear __________ phase reversal.
Heart rate is irregular, 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Essentially suppression of activity from the left hemisphere.
Markedly slow pattern on the right.
Rhythmic theta noted from the right hemisphere particularly in the central temporal regions.
Epileptiform activity with sharp waves at C4 or F8.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were recorded.  The findings of the EEG were discussed with the clinical team.  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of function in the left hemisphere, congruent with imaging.  There is epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere, which __________ ongoing vigilance.
