History:	31yo woman with a history of spastic CP and epilepsy who presents with change in
mental status following surgical replacement of her baclofen pump. Patient was
initially responsive status post surgery but then become less responsive. Pt was given
a dose of baclofen in the OR.
Medications:	Baclofen, Keppra, Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of low amplitude irregular fast
activity with underriding theta<delta activity.  During brief drowsiness, there is decrease in diffuse
Intermittent moderate amplitude sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves are noted over the left
frontocentral region.  Maximal scalp negativity occurs over F3/C3 leads.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Beta, excessive
No electrographic seizures
Spikes, intermittent, left, frontocentral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and intermittent left
frontocentral epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  There is a potential epileptogenic focus emanating
from the left frontocentral region.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
