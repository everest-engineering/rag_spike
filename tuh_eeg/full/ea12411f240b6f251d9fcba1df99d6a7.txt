History:		57 year old man who presents for a follow-up EEG for memory difficulties and episodes of loss of consciousness.
Medications:	Keppra Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes,  awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation , photic
Description:
Waking  background  is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.   Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal  regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.   During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates. A single EKG demonstrates heart rate of - 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 26-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A single EKG demonstrates heart rate of
- 60 bpm.
