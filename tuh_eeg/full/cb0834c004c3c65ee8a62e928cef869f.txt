CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 20-year-old, 21 weeks' pregnant, with syncopal episode preceded by lightheadedness, blurry vision, felt hot and then passed out.  She has had 2 previous syncopal episodes and monthly episodes of blurry vision.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm and rhythmic central slowing.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If there are any questions, a followup study capturing more prolonged sleep may be of value.
