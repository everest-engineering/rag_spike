History:	42 year old woman with a history of a congenital stroke and seizures.
Medications:	TEGRETOL, VALIUM PRN,, WARFARIN, ASA, ALBUTEROL,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Additionally, diffuse brief (1-4 second) bursts of diffuse high amplitude delta activity are noted
Subtle voltage attenuation is noted in the left parasagittal leads.  This voltage difference improves
with drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces diffuse,
symmetric high-voltage, frontally-maximal 2-3Hz activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Voltage attenuation, mild, left parasagittal leads
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 26 minute awake and drowsy EEG due to minimal voltage attenuation
observed over the left parasagittal (pericentral) leads (region). This finding indicates subcortical
focal cerebral dysfunction over that region.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
