CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old right handed woman who has been previously evaluated for nonepileptic seizures.  She has had only one seizure in the last year, perhaps related to stress.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.  The patient had a hair weave which made it challenging to place electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low to medium amplitude.  There is a well-developed 9-Hz alpha rhythm.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta with slow-rolling eye movements.  Vertex waves were observed in stage I sleep with vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.

HR:    84 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Despite the technical problems described above, this was a normal EEG.  Photic stimulation was not performed today.
