DATE OF STUDY:  April 27 through 28.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring is performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No clinical seizures were reported.  The patient has extensive braids.  Her head was wrapped in an attempt to try and preserve the electrode integrity.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There are sections where the electrode integrity is pretty good.  Unfortunately, there are also other sections where it is not, particularly at C3.
Although there are no clinical seizures noted, there is a prominent burst of rhythmic delta from the right temporal region with a sharp wave at 12:29.  This did not appear to have triggered the seizure and spike detector.  The patient is lying on her side.  She moves about afterward.  Although this is highly suspicious for a subclinical seizure, seizure onset and offset is difficult to tell and there are other electrode problems.  Sleep is characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  The patient spent most of the day in bed.  __________ is identified.  Unfortunately, every time the patient moves around, it triggers the seizure and spike detector, which makes it very difficult to rely on the seizure and spike detector for epileptiform seizures.
Heart rate 60 to 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring recording was remarkable for:
Interictal epileptiform activity which included sharp waves, primarily seen on the right.
One clear complex partial seizure which was not adequately localized by scalp and part due to technical difficulties.
Question subclinical seizure at midday on the 27th, again with some technical issues due to electrode issues.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a focal mechanism for epilepsy based on the interictal spikes and the seizure semiology on the video, but the data obtained is not adequate for a presurgical localization.
