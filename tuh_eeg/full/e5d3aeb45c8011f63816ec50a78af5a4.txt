History:	61 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH NEW ONSET SZ X 2 ON 12/20/13 SEEN
AT OSH, REPORTS EPISODES OF LOC W/SHAKING. LASTING 4 MIN, HX VAGUE
DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIER
Medications:	Keppra, Per list from patient, Zantac, Tylenol, Triglide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with
eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness, the
posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional independent polymorphic delta activity is present in the
right region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  2) intermittent independent focal slowing in bitemporal regions greater on the left
side.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in these regions, which is etiologically
non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
