CLINICAL HISTORY: A 55-year-old woman with asthma, depression, and epilepsy as well as chronic pain, currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS: Singulair, gabapentin 600 at bedtime, temazepam, metoprolol, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, EEG is appropriately organized for age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuated frontally predominant 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity. In hyperventilation, bursts were approximately 2.5 seconds in duration, frontally predominant and symmetric. Following hyperventilation, bursts were seen typically less in a second in duration. Testing was performed during the bursts and no impairment of awareness could be demonstrated. The spike and wave discharges were seen on occasion as the patient transitioned to a drowsy state with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response but spike and wave discharges occurred after, not during the photic stimulation period.
Heart rate 54 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to frontally predominant 3-4 Hz spike and wave activity with polyspike and wave activity accentuated by hyperventilation and early drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No clinical seizures could be demonstrated in this EEG. All bursts were brief. These findings are identical to a previous EEG 05/04/2007.
