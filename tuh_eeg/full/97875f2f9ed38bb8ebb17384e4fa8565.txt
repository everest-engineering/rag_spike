RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: This section of the record shows an ongoing improvement in the background.  In wakefulness, particularly the close of the record, the background EEG is nearly normal with a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz and rare, if any, left temporal focal slowing.  The sleep record continues to show sharp and slow, spike and slow wave complexes from the left temporal region with occasionally rhythmic and occasionally sharply contoured arrhythmic delta activity from the left temporal region.  In sleep in this 24-hour section of the record, there is small, discrete, right anterior temporal sharp waves, but the overall ratio of left to right temporal epileptiform activity is clearly greater than 10:1 and perhaps as high as 50:1.
HR:  56 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal 48-hour video EEG monitoring due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Left temporal spike and slow wave activity.
Transient generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generalized background slowing and the focal slowing, as well as the epileptiform activity gradually improved over time compatible with a postictal state.  This tracing supports a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The small, discrete sharp waves on the right are of unclear significance.  They may be independent discharges or an alternative dipole for the activity described above.
