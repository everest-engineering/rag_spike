INTRODUCTION: digital video EEG was performed at bedside using
standard 10-20 of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation
and photic are performed.
This bedside EEG continues to demonstrate a
activity at approximately 5 Hz. The e Is subtle
frequency evolution. activity can be reviewed at a very slow paper speed and the e
are no traditionally seizures, just a pattern of higher amplitude spike activity
with a small amount frequency evolution. There Is an after going slow wave
observed in the . In a 20 second epoch this pattern may occur 3 or 4 times.
Tactile stimulation of patient does not activate the record. It is difficult to determine
with the bedside If the patient is still twitching.
