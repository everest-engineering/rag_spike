History:	27 year old man with a history of seizures. Medications:	Depakote, Flexeril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min

Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation , photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. A single generalized sharp transient is captured at 1:53:30 PM. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp transients, one generalized Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The single sharply contoured waveform is of unclear clinical significance. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
