History: 24 YO RH FEMALE WITH HX OF EPILEPSY.  C/C IS HEADACHES A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK TEMPORAL, PARIETAL, LASTING FOR AN HOUR. INCREASING FREQUENCY.
Medications: ZONEGRAN
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep. the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric steep spindles appear. No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
HR: 60 bpm
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation. and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR 60.
INTERPRETATION: This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep
