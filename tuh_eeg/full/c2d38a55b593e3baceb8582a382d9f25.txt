CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old woman found on the floor awake, but drowsy, history of frontotemporal stroke with encephalomalacia for 5 years, right hemiparesis with aphasia, and auditory hallucinations.  The patient was on the floor for 3 days because she was too weak to stand.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The patient was quite somnolent throughout the test.  Photic stimulation was completed and hyperventilation was attempted.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record, but with stimulation there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm noted.  Prominent, lateral eye movements were noted.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and in sleep there is occasional focal delta in the left hemisphere, particularly in the central regions.  Head rocking artifact was noted.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep.
Occasional, bilateral posterior slowing was noted.
Heart rate 104 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
An excessively drowsiness patient.
Occasional bursts of posteriorly predominant slowing in sleep.
Rare slowing from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG demonstrates an excessively drowsy patient, congruent with the clinical history.  The rare bursts of posteriorly predominant delta as well as the left central delta may be correlated with imaging, but are not as prominent as one might anticipate given the clinical history described above.  There were no epileptiform features.  There was no significant photic driving.
