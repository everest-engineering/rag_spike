History:	50 YEAR OLD FEMALE LEFT HANDED WITH A HEART ATTACK 2 MONTHS AGO.
NOW PRESENTS SEIZURE ACTIVITY WITH LOC TONGUE BITING AND
INCONTINENCE SHAKING EYES ROLLING BACK AND POST ICTAL OF
SLEEPINESS PAST M HX HTN
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness,
maximal at T4.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates from 9 to 11 fps.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid, T4
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
