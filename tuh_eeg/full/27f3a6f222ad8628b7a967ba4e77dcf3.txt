CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 82-year-old male previously after traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, previous EEG monitoring for recurrent syncope and traumatic SAH, again with frequent falling and syncope.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Crestor, Zoloft, Prilosec, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a routine, 20 minute EEG with acceptable impedances aside from the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage, but there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of excess background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta as well as slow rolling eye movements.  Electrode artifact was noted at T4 and T6 during this study.

Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 72 bpm with an abnormal QRS complex.

IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness due to excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are rare bursts of shifting slowing in drowsiness which is acceptable in an adult of this age.  The mild background theta was noted in this patient's previous routine EEG and long-term EEG monitoring in July 2013.
