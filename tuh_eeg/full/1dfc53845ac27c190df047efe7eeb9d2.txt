CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed male with head trauma in 1982, now losing track of time, depression,  anxiety, forgetfulness. Episodes of forgetfulness increasing in stress but none for the last month.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Glyburide, Actoplus, Aceon
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with 10 Hz 40 mcv posterior dominant rhythm. Occasional temporal wicket is observed. The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background followed by drowsiness.  More extensive stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles are observed later on in the record. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at faster flash frequencies.
HR:	78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. The wicket activity described above is a normal variant.
