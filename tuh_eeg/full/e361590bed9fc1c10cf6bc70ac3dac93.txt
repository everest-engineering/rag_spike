CLINICAL HISTORY:  90 year old woman with advanced dementia and a confusional spell.

MEDICATIONS: Aricept, Phenytoin, Namenda, Furosemide, Divalproex, Colchicine, Metoprolol, Temazepam, Amlodipine, Nitroglycerin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a low voltage continuous pattern with beta and smaller amounts of theta. There is little in the way of a well defined alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include and increase in beta. In addition, as the patient becomes drowsy and toward photic stimulation, a theta frequency pattern is identified. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.




IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Replacement  of normal background with generalized background slowing.
2. 	Rhythmic slowing of the alpha rhythm.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG appears to be slower voltage and slower then the previous study in 2006. No epileptiform features were identified in either study.
