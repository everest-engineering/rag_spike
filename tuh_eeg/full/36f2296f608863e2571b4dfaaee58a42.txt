History:	76 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH PMHX OF  SZ, CVA, HTN  S/P AORTIC ARCH
SURGERY. NOW FOR FOLLOW UP, PT DENIES ANY RECENT SZ EVENTS
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Heart rate is 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Intermittent focal slowing is a nonspecific
finding that is normal for his age.
