CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed female with a history of GERD, osteoporosis, spinal stenosis, IBS, hepatitis C virus, von Willebrand disease, and DJD, here for preoperative monitoring with recurrent seizures, scheduled for vagal nerve placement.



REASON FOR STUDY: Seizures.



MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Zonisamide, Lacosamide, Lasix



INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video long-term monitoring EEG was performed at bedside for 13 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes. Continuous spike detection software and seizure detection software were used to review the EEG, as well as patient reported events. The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep. No activating procedures were performed.



TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow posterior dominant rhythm which at best reaches 6 to 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening. There is some frontocentral beta seen. There are some stage changes during the recording with some typical features of sleep architecture. No activating procedures were performed.



ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:

1. Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and T4, at times with a sharp contour but not clearly epileptic.

2. Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz, seen continuously throughout the recording.



SEIZURES: None.



IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

1. Independent bilateral mid-temporal slow waves.

2. Generalized slow waves.



CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid-temporal regions with additional diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
