History:	59 year old man who remains comatose after smoke inhalation exposure.  CT head
shows cerebral edema.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background is severely attenuated and consists of diffuse slow
delta activity versus burst-suppressed pattern with delta-like waveforms that are artifactual (possibly
related to the IV drips).
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal portable 23-minute coma-only EEG due to marked diffuse background
slowing and lack of background reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In a post-anoxic patient this pattern indicates poor prognosis in
terms of full neurological recovery.  This EEG was not performed according the the ACNS
guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
