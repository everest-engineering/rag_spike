CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with likely complex partial seizures for several years who now is admitted for surgical evaluation.  The patient was sleep deprived from the night of 07/22/2013 until 07/23/2013.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lyrica off, Vimpat off, Seroquel.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Medical staff notes and nursing notes were reviewed.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Spike detector and seizure detector software were activated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), RMTD (rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness), vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, slow wave sleep and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  Occasional minimal polymorphic theta activity is observed over the left temporal region.  No seizures are recorded and no events occurred.
FINDINGS:
Minimal occasional left temporal slowing.
No events or seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is a minimally abnormal 24-hour continuous audio video electroencephalogram monitoring due to occasional minimal left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possible structural in etiology.   No seizures or typical events occurred.  The patient was sleep deprived on the night of 07/22/2013 until 07/23/2013.
