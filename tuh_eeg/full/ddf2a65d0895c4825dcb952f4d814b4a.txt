History:
Medications:	ZONISAMIDE,KLONOPIN,RENAGEL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse high
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. There are intermixed periods of bifrontal low amplitude beta. At times the frontal  high
voltage delta appears to become semirhythmic and more prominent. This is also seen with
stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Beta, intermittent, bilateral frontal
Disorganization, continuous
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate generalized
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing, disorganization and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  The bifrontal beta may be related to irritable cortex or even medication
