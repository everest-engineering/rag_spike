History:	44 year old man with a history of seizures, cognitive impairment, self-injurious
behaviors.

Medications:	Keppra, Tegretol and Seroquel
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Patient is cooperative during the first several minutes of the recording.  The background consists of
9-9.5 Hz alpha activity posteriorly and expected AP gradient.  For majority of the recording, patient
grinds teeth and has to be held down - EEG during that portion of the recording demonstrates large
amplitude abundant EMG artifact and diffuse beta activity.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.
Patient is awake throughout the recording.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with very poor
cooperation, and produces no effect.  Of note, F7-T3 and Fp2 and F4 leads are nearly isoelectric -
likely placed too close to each other.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Technically limited
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED 22-minute awake-only EEG because of abundant EMG (teeth
grinding artifact).  During a brief interpretable portion of the recording, the background appears
normal. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
