CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old right-handed woman with refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  This is a technically very challenging record for a patient with artificial hair.  The hair was prominently sewn into the posterior scalp region.  This is a 1-hour EEG for very drowsy patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The majority of this EEG captures drowsiness or stage 2 sleep.  In drowsiness, there are 2 benign epileptiform transients of sleep.  Stage 2 sleep and stage 1 sleep include abundant POSTS, but they are of little higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles were noted.  A single vertex wave was somewhat asynchronous.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drowsy and did not significantly activate the record.  Hyperventilation served to alert the patient and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  78-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically somewhat challenging, but EEG within normal limits, 1 hour.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  If further information is needed, a repeat study after the patient has removed her wig may be helpful.
