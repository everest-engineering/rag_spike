CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old with recurrent spells in which he becomes unaware of his environment and is disoriented.  The patient is amnestic for the spells.  Has 2 syncopal spells as well which he did recall.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were both completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing, slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 96-104 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Of note, the patient has a somewhat rapid heart rate for a resting adult.
