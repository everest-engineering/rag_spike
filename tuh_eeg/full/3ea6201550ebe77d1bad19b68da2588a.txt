CLINICAL HISTORY:  Acute respiratory arrest, CT demonstrated previous left thalamic infarct with anoxic features including R basal ganglia, multisystem injury. No clinical seizures  but evaluate for R eye deviation.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan and midazolam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrated a diffusely slow pattern with low voltage mixed theta and delta.  The patient had received benzodiazepines prior to the EEG.  As the recording continues, there was a bit more theta noted.  Tactile stimulation of the patient produced bilateral theta.
Heart rate 72 to 100 bpm, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
bihemispheric slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this patient who has recently received Ativan, this EEG demonstrates some reactivity and variability.  The overall pattern is relatively symmetric. Additional EEG recording will be performed to assess for subclinical seizures
