CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since she was a teenager, diabetes, hypertension, asthma and depression.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Prilosec, Glipizide, Ambien, Seroquel, Lovastatin, Singular, Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a low voltage pattern with generous beta. Hyperventilation serves to increase the amplitude in the background. Prominent Wicket is identified from the left to the right temporal region. Some to this is exquisitely focal at T3. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The temporal wicket described above is considered a normal variant. It can also be seen in individuals who have epilepsy. To more completely search for epileptiform activity, a more prolonged sleep study or a study with special electrodes is suggested.
