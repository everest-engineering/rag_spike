CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old male with history of left MCA stroke and light hemiparesis
with aphasia, now being readied for a left carotid endarterectomy.
REASON FOR STUDY: Pre-CEA.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Lovenox, Plavix, Protonix, Lorazepam, Labetalol
INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement system was performed with the addition of an anterior temporal and EKG
electrodes. The patients EEG was recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Activatingâ•–
procedures, including photic stimulation were performed. No hyperventilation was performed.
DIFFICULTIES: None.
OF THE RECORD: The EEG opens to a well formed posterior dominant
rhythm, better seen over the light hemisphere with a frequency of 8.5 Hz and an amplitude of
2250 mV, which Is reactive to eye opening and eye closing. There Is a mild amount of frontal
central beta. Sleep is .characterized by stage I. Photic stimulation was performed with no
abnormal discharges.
Abnormal Continuous focal slow waves seen over the left hemisphere maximal at
T3 with a frequency of2-Hz.
Seizures: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous left hemisphere slow waves maximal in the temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is consistent with focal structural cerebral dysfunction in
the left hemisphere, maximal in the temporal region, which is consistent with a known stroke. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
