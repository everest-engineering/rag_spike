REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old man with possible localization related epilepsy refractory to medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software, as well as seizure detection software on patient's event and nurses notes were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Stage I and stage II sleep
stages.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and at times, at T4, with a frequency at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  At times, slightly sharply contoured.
SEIZURES:  None.
EVENTS:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left bilateral mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  This is end of day 1 of recording.
