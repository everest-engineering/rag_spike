CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old man with a history of stroke and right hemiparesis, as well as DVT, for follow-up EEG for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, insulin, Pravastatin, ProSource, Tylenol, Warfarin, and Dilantin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness as well as drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded while awake, and there appears to be some state changes but no classic sleep architecture.  It appears that he becomes drowsy.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at a frequency of 5 to 7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild to moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
