CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old female with history of asthma, chronic vision loss, anxiety, and back pain, presents with witnessed seizures and witnessed by EMS.
MEDICATIONS:  Advair, Spiriva, Paxil, Xanax, Trazodone.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness, as well as stage I sleep.
No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Multielectrode artifact, as well as movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The posterior dominant rhythm is seen best over the left hemisphere.  There is normal frontal central beta, although at times this is lacking.
The patient reaches stage I sleep.  No activating procedures are performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at P4, at times at P6 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
There is generalized slow waves seen at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen almost continuously during the limited wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right parietal and posterior temporal slowing.
Mild generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right parietal and posterior temporal regions, which is consistent with a known lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Note:  This is a limited EEG due to marked motion artifact.
