CLINICAL HISTORY:  The clinical history of the patient:  He is a 34-year-old man with a history of mental retardation and childhood epilepsy, currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness:  9.5 Hz alpha rhythm was observed.  Lambda waves were noted as were prominent eye movement artifacts.  Occasional posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  There is a small degree of background disorganization.  There are intermittent, infrequent bursts of irregular delta, left greater than right in wakefulness.
The patient was not cooperative with hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
The heart rate was 90 beats per minute of apparent sinus origin.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  No sharp waves or spikes were seen.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison and the background disorganization and the occasional slowing maybe related to this patient's neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
