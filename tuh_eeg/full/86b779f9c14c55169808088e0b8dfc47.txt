CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old gentleman with previous left temporal hemorrhage, progressive memory problems, word finding difficulty.
MEDICATIONS: Namenda, Coumadin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Intermittent rhythmic left temporal focal slowing is identified. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing, as well as anterior spread of the alpha and a little bit more
rhythmic slowing in the left frontal temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were noted in previous EEGs dating to 2006. No epileptiform features were identified at this time. These findings are congruent with his previous left temporal pathology.
