CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 63-year-old woman with right frontal hemangioma, daily headaches, impaired balance, and titubation of the jaw.  Uncontrolled involuntary movements with jaw shaking and altered mentation for the last 9 years.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient had very prominent trembling throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the tremble artifact, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, diffuse theta, and significant head rocking artifact.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in beta.  With instruction, such as asking the patient to count backwards from 10, the patient stops trembling quite so much.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for more trembling and scant driving.
Heart rate:  70 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is likely within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG recording for this patient is likely normal but unfortunately, the patient was not able to stop her head trembling consistently.  In the brief sections where she was able to stop the head trembling, the EEG does appear normal.  This is the third EEG for this patient without epileptiform activity but this EEG did seem to capture much more of her clinical symptoms which are not associated with epileptiform discharges.
