REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old man with a history of hypertension and alcoholic cirrhosis who presented to the hospital after noticing that his right face and arm were twitching, lasting for 2 to 3 minutes.  The twitching occurred about 10 times and he was able to talk during the episode.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  The patient was sedated.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some 60 Hz artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  There is an overall diffuse beta seen overlying the entire recording.  There is some improvement at times in the frequency as the patient wakes up and appears to be reactive.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp waves seen at P3 at times in pseudoperiodic manner with a frequency of 1 Hz and at times every 3 to 4 seconds occurring almost continuously throughout the recording.  There appears to be no muscle correlate to the spikes seen on the video.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to left parietal spikes, as well as generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arousing from the left parietal region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The overriding beta suggests that this may be at least in part due to a medication effect.  No seizures were seen in the recording.
