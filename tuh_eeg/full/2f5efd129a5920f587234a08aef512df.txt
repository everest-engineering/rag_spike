CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed woman with seizures since March 2012, approximately 18 week's pregnant, presents for recurrent seizures 2 months ago with loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Bursts of symmetric anterior predominant generalized spikes and waves at 4.5 Hz were seen, lasting about 1 to 2 seconds with no clinical correlate.
During the recording the patient had a quick jerk during sleep, stage I, which had no clear EEG correlate.  This occurred at 10:10:04 a.m.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spike and wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  No seizures were seen.  The findings on the report were communicated to the neurologist as it was read.
