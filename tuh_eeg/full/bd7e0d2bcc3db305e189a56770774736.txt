TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel	electroencephalogram (EEG) bedside portable was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically somewhat satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG but no HV nor photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and diffusely slow with a mixture of theta, alpha and delta frequencies.	There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.	The patient is very inattentive and is moving about during the EEG
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, and dropout of muscle artifact was noted
Moderate generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal bedside portable EEG
generalized background slowing
excess muscle artifact
There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
a
This EEG supports	diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, it is a nonspecific pattern which can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.	No epileptiform features were seen.
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is needed, a repeat study in the laboratory to suggested
