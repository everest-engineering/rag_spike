History:	52 YO MALE R HANDED. PT WAS IN MVA ON 3 DAYS AGO.AFTER ACCIDENT
HE LOC+, AND WAS SHAKING. PT SAYS HE HAS BACK PAIN NOW.NO H/O SZ.
56 CM HEAD
Medications:	FLEXERIL,MORPHINE,LOVENOX,PREDNISONE,ASPIRIN,LIPITOR,LASIX,DIAZEPAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left fronto temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left posterior
temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 126 with PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal, Some central spread
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, posterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of focal slowing in the left frontotemporal
and posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
consistent with the known infarcts.  Please note the tachycardia.
