History:	72 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF HEADACHES AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION
Medications:	BACOPIN, MOTRIN, ASA,
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Very frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F7/T1 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  At times the discharges are sharply contoured and suspicious in
morphology.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 66.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal, At times very sharply contoured
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
fronto- temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  However, at times the focal slowing was sharply contoured and had a
suspicious morphology. Repeated prolonged EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep is recommended
in order to better asses the nature of these discharges.
