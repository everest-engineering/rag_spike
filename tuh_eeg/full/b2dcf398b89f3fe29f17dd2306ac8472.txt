REASON FOR STUDY:  Altered mental status.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old right-handed lady now presents with altered mental status.  Past medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, MI status post PCI x3, stroke x2, memory loss, diabetes, and depression.

MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, folic acid, famotidine, insulin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  The patient was confused during the recording.  Activation procedures included photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation was not performed.

TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background is diffusely slow bilaterally in the theta and delta range.  No posterior dominant rhythm was noted during the recording.

Sleep was not achieved during the recording.

Photic stimulation was performed which did not elicit any changes.

Abnormal discharges:
1. F7/ T3 left anterior temporal polymorphic continuous slowing at 2-4 Hz.
2. Right F8/ T4 polymorphic continuous anterior temporal slowing seen independently at 2-4 Hz.
3. Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz continuously.

Seizures:  None.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to bilateral independent continuous anterior temporal polymorphic slowing in the theta and delta range in addition to diffuse slow waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral focal cerebral dysfunction in the anterior temporal regions, which has a high correlation with a structural lesion in that region. In addition there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
