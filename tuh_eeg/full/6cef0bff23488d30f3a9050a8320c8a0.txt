CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old female with recurrent TIAs. Evaluate for seizures.
Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20 system  of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. There is some 5Hz temporal theta activity, some of which is a bit irregular. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR: 	78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2.	There is rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness, but some of this is a little bit more irregular than would otherwise be expected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
