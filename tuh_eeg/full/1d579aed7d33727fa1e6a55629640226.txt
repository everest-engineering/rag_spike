5/2014, SZ, MVA, PT NOW REPORT OF 1 SZ ONSET 4 WEEKS AGO, WITH 2
MORE SZ FOLLOWING APPROX 1 WEEK APART. SZ ARE WITH LOC, SHAKING,
TONGUE BITING AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is also an associated increased amplitude of the faster
frequencies over this region which is consistent with a breach.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontal, with an associated breach
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous left frontotemporal focal
slowing. This finding is indicative of  focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in
origin and consistent with the known craniotomy.
