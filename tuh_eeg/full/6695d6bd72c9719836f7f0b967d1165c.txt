REASON FOR STUDY:  Short loss of responsiveness for seconds, head pressure as well as dizziness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old woman with history of epilepsy who presents with episodes of pressure in her head with intermittent loss of responsiveness for a second.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed using 10-20 system of electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software and nurse's notes of patient's events were all used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The records opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I, stage II and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Episodes:  The patient did have one episode during this recording which occurred at 10:15 p.m. where the doctor was in the room and the patient, after recently being woken up, felt like she was having her typical episodes lasting for seconds.  During this episode, there was no change in her EEG or EKG.
Heart rate:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The one episode of quick unresponsiveness did not reveal any EEG changes.  As such, it may represent simple partial which in 75% of the time does not show any EEG correlate or, alternatively, may represent unknown epileptic event.
