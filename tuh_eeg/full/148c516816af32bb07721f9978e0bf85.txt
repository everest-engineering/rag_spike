CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed female with a 5-year history of epilepsy with
tonic clonic seizures followed by postictal confusion, tongue biting. Either the seizures are the
postictal, lasts 1 hour.
Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In relaxed wakefulness, there Is an 8.7 Hz 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. The overall organization for an adult of this age is at the limits of
normal. There are Isolated, frontally pre dominantly spike and slow waves, and sharp and slow
waves complexes identified In relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation produces an increase In
theta in the background. With this vigorous hyperventilation response there is a fair amount of
movement, but also a suggestion of a pair of T4 sharp waves. As the patient drifts off to sleep
there Is some notched frontal delta. On one occasion a bit more prominent on the right
compared to the left. Additionally, eye movement artifact has similar appearance. Vertex
waves are identified in stage 1 sleep, followed immediately by an arousal. Continuous eye blink
Is seen as the patient awaits photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response with
supraharmonic driving. Eye flutter is noted in photic stimulation again. During photic stimulation
again there is a suggestion of bifrontal sharp and slow wave complex.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominantly spike and slow wave and sharp and slow wave complexes, as
well as single polyspike discharge maximum in the right frontal region.
2. Right intertemporal sharp waves
CORRELATION: This EEG Is more supportive of a localization related mechanism
than a generalized mechanism for epilepsy. If additional information is needed, additional
recording may be appropriate.
