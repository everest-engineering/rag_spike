Technique:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram {EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system was performed utilized a NicOne system. This bedside portable record captures drowsiness and sleep with minimal wakefulness.	Neither photic stimulation nor hyperventilation were performed
EEG Background:
The waking background was poorly organized,	characterized by the presence of a 6Hz	symmetric mixture of alpha, modest quantities of theta	and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 6 Hz Hertz posterior dominant rhythm {PDR) . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude was present.
During drowsiness the EEG was comprised of a mixed frequency theta pattern.
Sleep spindles were	present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep was not seen.
Moderate generalized slowing was present.	No focal slowing was present.
Paroxysmal Activity {non-epileptiform) : None
Epileptiform Activity:
No epileptiform activity was present.
There were no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
Impression :
This is an abnormal primarily asleep routine EEG due to: Moderate Generalized slowing
Clinical Correlation:
Generalized background is a non specific finding which can be seen in a toxic or metabolic process. There were no epileptiform features.
Clinical Correlation is suggested.
