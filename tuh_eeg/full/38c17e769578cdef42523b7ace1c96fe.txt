CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old male with hepatitis C, tuberculosis and alcohol withdrawal seizures.  Multiple recurrent hospitalizations for seizures, recently on the inpatient service in February 2013, for recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Vertex waves were noted in stage I sleep.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral drawing.  Heart rate 108.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness to stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
