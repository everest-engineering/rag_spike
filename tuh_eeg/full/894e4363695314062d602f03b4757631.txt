History:	81 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF DEMENTIA. PROBLEMS WITH ARTICULATING,
WILL MEAN DOOR BUT SAY WINDOW.   PER SISTER PT HAS GOTTEN MUCH
WORSE IN THE LAST YR SINCE DAUGHTER AND HUSBAND DIED.  PMHX: DM,
HTNM OSA, COGNITIVE DEF, HYPERLIPIDEMIA, PVD, GERD.
Medications:	RISPERDAL, METOPROLOL, LOVASTATIN, CARBOXYMETHYCELLULOSE SOD,
MELATONIN, AMLODIPINE, NITROGLYCERIN, POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Few focal sharp es are present with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at T3.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Sharp waves, few, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of few epileptiform discharges in the left
region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition
there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
