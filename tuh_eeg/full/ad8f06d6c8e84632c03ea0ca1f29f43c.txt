CLINICAL HISTORY: 6.7 year old male status post massive intracerebral hemorrhage, craniotomy, subarachnoid. History of anxiety, dyslipidemia, HTN, COPD and PAD. The patient had an episode of twitching on the night of the 22nd.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Gentamicin, Famotidine, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Cefepime, Vancomycin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a prominent craniotomy site.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Overall background is rich in faster frequency activity. It is a continuous pattern. Arrhythmic delta activity and a breech rhythm them are noted in the right frontocentral region. There is variability in the record, particularly from the left hemisphere. There is occasional delta noted from the left. As the recording continues, the activity on the right waxes and wanes, some sections are richer and faster frequency activity than others but with most prominent of faster frequency activity in the right frontal region. In the context of a breech there is sharply contoured activity at F4.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal flowing from the right frontocentral region characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the magnitude of this patient's neurosurgical process, this is a rich background and a reactive EEG.
