History:	63 YR MALE WITH STROKE ALERT LAST PM WITH LEFT FACIAL NUMBNESS
AND  SLURRED SPEECH.  PMHX:  HTN, HLD, COPD, NSCLC ( CHEMO), WITH
LIVER METS.  NOW FOUND TO HAVE BRAIN METS.
Medications:	DILAUDID, MS-CONTIN MORPHINE, MIRALAX, PROTONIX, LOVENOX,
AMLODIPINE, VALSARTAN, SINGULAIR, LORATADINE, ERGOCALCIFEROL,

Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal spike-and-wave discharges and sharp
waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7/T1 and T3.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
in the left anterior temporal  region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic
focus in this region. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with the known
