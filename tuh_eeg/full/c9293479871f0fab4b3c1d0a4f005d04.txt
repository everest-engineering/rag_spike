History:	51 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES.  ABOUT 2-4 A MONTH.  PT WITH
FLIGHT/GTC/LOC/POST CONFUSION.  LAST SZ 9/15/11 WITH FALL ENDED IN
ER.
FOLLOW UP  EEG 3/18/14 LAST SZ THIS PASSED SUNDAY, WHERE PT WAS
Medications:	Tegretol, Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce any effect.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
