CLINICAL A 72Â·year-old woman evaluated earlier this month for right-sided weakness. Multiple embolic strokes and confusion. Now with 2nd alteration in mental status and psychosis.
MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Norvasc, Keppra, metformin, others.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was confused. Impedances were under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-2 electrodes. The background EEG is markedly disorganized. It is primarily a theta frequency background with a posterior dominant rhythm of at basis Hz. This pattern is interrupted by bursts of arrhythmic delta activity, left or right There are some more sustained bursts of irregular delta which are sharply contoured In the left mid temporal region. In this sharply contoured record, there also some isolated bursts of sharply contoured, rig t central temporal delta.
The Video is reviewed. The patient demonstrates no clinical signs with the bursts of sharply contoured delta on the left.
Heart rate: 75 bpm irregular.
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due:
1. More prominent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity but particularly from the left temporal region which are more sharply contoured than earlier this month.
2. Additional bursts of sharply contoured activity and arrhythmic delta on the right with rare right central temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. In addition, the bursts of arrhythmic delta activity may be correlated with imaging given the patients history of recent infarcts. The arrhythmic delta activity is a bit more prominent than earlier this month and is more sharply contoured so ongoing observation for subtle seizures is suggested.
