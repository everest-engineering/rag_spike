History:	87 year old woman with a history of dementia, strokes, CAD, a-fib, now presents with
generalized convulsion.  There was reported gaze deviation to the left.
Convulsions stopped with Ativan.
Medications:	ativan, Dilantin, Cardizem
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, lethargic, photic
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude theta and delta activity with underriding fast activity.  During sleep, low amplitude sleep
spindles and periods of discontinuity are noted.
There is subtle paucity of faster frequencies over the right lateral leads.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart rate up
to 120 -150 bpm with occasional inter-QRS pauses up to 1.5 seconds.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Cardiac arrhythmia
No electrographic seizures
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right lateral leads
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 25-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and
focal right temporoparietal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal
cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  A single EKG lead demonstrates irregular heart
rate up to 120 -150 bpm with occasional inter-QRS pauses up to 1.5 seconds.  No electrographic
