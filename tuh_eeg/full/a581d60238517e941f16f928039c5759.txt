CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old woman with new onset paroxysmal dizziness since Thanksgiving.  The patient becomes drowsy then states that she is short of breath and then has some paroxysmal dizziness.  Two year history of dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Aricept.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  There is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Intermittent slowing with rhythmic or arrhythmic delta activity was noted.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing of the background.
Photic stimulation started to alert the patient with scant driving.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Background slowing.
Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described above is relatively characteristic of a demented female, although it was not particularly characteristic of any particular form of dementia.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If this patient continues to have paroxysmal spells, an EEG monitoring session may be of value.
