History:	43 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH HX: SEIZURE, SCHIZOPHRENIA, BIPOLAR
DISEASE. LAST SEIZURE AUG. 2013 W/ FOAM AT MOUTH, TONGUE BITE,
INCONTINENCE OF URINE, HEAD BANGING. CONFUSED  AND TIRED
Medications:	KEPPRA, PHENOBARBITAL, PROZAC, COGENTIN, HALOPERIDOL INJ
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Posterior dominant rhythm reached 8Hz at best.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As
drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with poor cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
