CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with diffuse intracranial hemorrhage status post
three 5 minute codes on the 19th. Evaluate for persistent unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS: Phenylephrine, Norepinephrine, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated,
unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly suppressed.
There are some artifacts, but there does appear to be some underlying very low voltage
3.9 Hz activity in the background. There is no reactivity and there â•–is little variability
noted. Despite the artifacts and the rapid heart rate, there does appear to be scant
cerebral activity picked up in the central regions.
HR: 150 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe underlying
disturbance of cerebral function. 'It is a markedly suppressed pattern but it does not
meet the criteria for electrocerebral silence.
