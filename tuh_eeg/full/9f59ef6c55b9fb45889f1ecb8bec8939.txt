History:	52 YR FEMALE WITH HIV, SCHIZOPHRENIA D/O, SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE,
SUICIDE ATTEMPT, PRESENTS WITH WITNESSED SZ. IN ER.  CONCERN FOR
MENINGITIS // FOLLOW UP EEG PT NOTED WITH EYE GAZE EEG TO R/O SZ.///
NOW LTM FOR 24 HRS
Medications:	risperdal,zoloft,HAART,phenobarbital,phenytoin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 80-90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, bilateral generalized
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and attenuation.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Clinical
correlation is recommended.
