RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Epilepsy Monitoring Unit EEG TYPE: Long term recording
EEG #: 15-343
EPILEPSY MONITORING UNIT REPORT HISTORY:
This is a 58 y.o. female admitted for continuous
video-electroencephalography	(VEEG) monitoring with a history of : paroxysmal events of unclear etiology.
Continuous video EEG is initiated for: Medication adjustment
Inpatient continuous EEG monitoring required due to one or more of the following reasons:
The patient is having medically uncontrolled seizures or clinical events, which poses a significant mortality and morbidity risk.	Continuous monitoring will aid in diagnosis and determining best treatment options.	If seizures are left untreated, there is a 10-20% annual morbidity and 2% annual mortality rate.
Continuous monitoring is required to capture a sufficient number of clinical events or seizures, while medication are reduced or provoked, which increases the risk of severe seizures and at risk of seizures causing injury or status epilepticus;
The EMU is set up to monitor and record EEGs during seizures and it includes nurses trained to provide first aid and patient
safety during seizures;
The full hospital team must be present t deal with these medical emergency situations should they arise, including nurses to document patient' s exam
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:
A routine 21 channel digital EEG was recorded at the onset of monitoring.	The patient then underwent continuous CCTV/EEG monitoring using a cable telemetry system.	Scalp electrodes were placed and secured with collodion according to the 10-20 international electrode system.	Additionally, Tl and T2 electrodes were placed in this patient.	Impedances were measured and verified to be below 5 Kohms.		EEG activity was recorded referentially to vertex reference, digitized, and stored to computer hard drive.	The entire record was reviewed.
Staff supervision, patient-initiated event buttons and computerized algorithms allowed detection of epileptiform EEG activity and correlation with behavior.	For approximately 8 hours each day the patient was attended by an EEG technician.	A neurologist was available in person or on call 24 hours per day. The patient was monitored via video 24 hours per day by a technician with special training in seizure recognition and testing.	During times when a technician was not available, EEG recording, video recording, and computer analysis continued, and nursing performed seizure testing and electrode maintenance.
The Getman spike and seizure detection computer program (trademark named "Stellate") was used to screen the EEG in real time for electrographic seizures and interictal discharges.
Samples of EEG were recorded periodically.	Detections were reviewed in detail by attending neurologist.		All events and detections, as well as selected samples, were stored to external hard drive media.
MEDICATIONS:
Keppra XR 1000 mg qhs Dilantin ER 600 mg ql2h

BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 8.5-9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
There are prominent lambda waves, which is a normal waveform.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric POSTS, vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes . Slow wave sleep was not captured.

SUMMARY OF VIDEO EEG FINDINGS:
INTERICTAL FINDINGS:	The patient' s interictal findings were significant for a normal EEG with an 8-5-9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, without any focal findings or epileptiform discharges.
ICTAL FINDINGS:
The patient had several episodes of -palpitations, correlating with an irregular heart beat.
The patient additionally had an episode of smelling rubber on 12/10/2015, which had no ictal EEG cerebral correlate.
SEIZURE DIAGNOSIS:	No seizures captured
EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS:	No seizures captured; normal EEG CONCLUSION:
was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for 7 days with continuous video EEG.	This was an elective EMU monitoring session for medication adjustment; the goal was to titrate off Dilantin .
The interictal EEG is characterized by a normal background without any epileptiform discharges.
Several episodes of palpitations correlated with an irregular heart beat on EKG.
An episode of smelling rubber on 12/10/2015 had no ictal EEG cerebral correlate, but a surface negative seizure cannot be excluded.
The patient was weaned off Dilantin over the course of his admission. She was at first tried on Vimpat, but reported palpitations. Therefore Vimpat was discontinued and her Keppra was uptitrated.
