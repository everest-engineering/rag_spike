CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed man with congenital hydrocephalus and seizures for 20 years, as well as episodes of loosing consciousness here for an increased number of episodes of loss of consciousness, differential, and classification.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Keppra.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages.  No activating procedures were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Normal sleep architecture is seen.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  During the recording there is an overriding central theta that occurs intermittently in wakefulness and sleep.  Its pattern is more consistent with a ciganek rhythm, however, the overall recurrence of it may suggest a possible pathologic nature to this pattern.

SEIZURES/EVENTS:  None.  No press pauses or seizure events occurred in 24 hours.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The central theta pattern may resemble a benign variant, however, the overall predominance may suggest possible abnormality of unclear significance.
