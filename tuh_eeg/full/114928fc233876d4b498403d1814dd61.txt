History:	33 YO FEMALE PT HAS HAD A TOTAL OF 4 SZ AND HAS BEEN SZ FREE FOR 12
YEARS. LAST EEG WAS 5 YEARS AGO WHICH SHOWED "SZ ACTIVITY". PT
STOPPED TAKING HER TEGRETOL 1 MONTH AGO DUE TO BECOMING
PREGNANT (SHE IS CURRENTLY 10 WEEKS).
Medications:	BP MED, PRENATAL VITAMIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional brief bursts (1-2 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal
spike-and-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of 4.0 - 4.5Hz.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of occasional generalized spike-and-wave,
which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise normal.  These findings are
consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
