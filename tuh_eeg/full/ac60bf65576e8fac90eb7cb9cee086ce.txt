simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm,
drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm followed by the appearance
of beta, Hyperventilation produces rhythmic background slowing. Photic stimulation is
performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and elicits scant driving.
