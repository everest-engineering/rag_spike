DATE OF STUDY:  09/26 to 09/27/2013
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old male with post traumatic epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol taper.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was utilized in the EEG monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient experienced no clinical seizures, and no electrographic seizures were noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
INTERICTAL EEG:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In drowsiness in particular, focal slowing is noted from the right hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions with some rhythmic theta.  This section of the continuous EEG recording is remarkable for a bit more focal slowing noted both in wakefulness, relaxed wakefulness and sleep.  There are rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing also noted including 3:20 a.m. on the morning of the 27th.
IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:
R focal slowing congruent with prior TBI but no seizures or sharp waves as of this date
