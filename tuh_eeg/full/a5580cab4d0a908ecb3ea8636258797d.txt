CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old woman, status post respiratory arrest more than 72 hours ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin:   No sedative hypnotic medications.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  ECS montage was utilized for total recording time greater than 1 hour.  Electrode integrity was tested.  Body temperature:  T 100.8
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is markedly low voltage and suppressed.  There is no reactivity or variability.  There is an isolated, less than 6 hertz theta wave noted intermittently, picked up in the eye leads.  In addition, there is scant, low voltage, mixed alpha theta seemed infrequently.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked suppression of cerebral activity.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is profoundly suppressed, but does not definitively demonstrate electrocerebral silence.  A repeat study may be of value, dependent on management plans.
