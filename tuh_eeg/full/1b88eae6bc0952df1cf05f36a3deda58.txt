History:	58 year old man with a history of a stroke and now new seizures.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, photic
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The
background over the right consists of 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening and the
expected AP gradient.  The background over the left consists of polymorphic 8 Hz theta activity
posteriorly with lack of AP gradient and excess polymorphic attenuated theta and delta activity.
Sleep spindles and K-complexes are captured.  They are better formed over the right hemisphere.
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
No epileptiform discharges
Asymmetry, sleep architecture, better formed over the right
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EGG due to continuous moderate left
hemispheric slowing that is more pronounced anteriorly. Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
