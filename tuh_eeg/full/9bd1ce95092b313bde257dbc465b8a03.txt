History:	57 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P MVA, UNRESTRAINED
PASSENGER, WITH LOC. GTC SZ LASTING 15 MIN ON ARRIVAL TO HOSPITAL,
CT SHOWED B/L  SAH
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 10-20uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At times it is sharply contoured.  No epileptiform
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  Please note that these discharges are
sharply contoured and can be suspicious for epileptiform discharges.  No clinical or electrographic
