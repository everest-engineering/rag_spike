CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed woman with a history of migraine headaches, the first onset in February 2011 along with a history of kidney disorder.  The patient stated that the headaches are every day.  Past medical history significant for a stroke in 2005 with residual left-sided weakness.  The patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening headaches and possible seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recording during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz on both sides which is reactive to eye opening.  However, there is some focal slowing seen on both sides, especially on the left side in the midtemporal region at T3.  The patient appears to go into stage 1 sleep during this recording.  Activation procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing in the midtemporal region with the maximum at T3 and also at T4.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the midtemporal region on both left and the right hemisphere with the maximum at T3 and T4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Focal  bilateral midtemporal region, right more left were nonspecific in regard to etiology. No sharp waves were recorded.
