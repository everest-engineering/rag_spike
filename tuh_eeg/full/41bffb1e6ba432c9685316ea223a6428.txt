CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, recurrent
nocturnal seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
slow with excess background theta. Despite this, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm and
an 8.5 hertz mu rhythm. In relaxed wakefulness, there is some rhythmic temporal
slowing.Hyperventilation clearly accentuated rhythmic temporal theta, left more so than
the right. Following hyperventilation, despite some muscle and movement artifact. there
is rhythmic slowing in the left temporal region and occasional left temporal sharp waves.
Stage I sleep is characterized by POSTS followed by vertex waves. Photic stimulation is
performed while the patient is in stage II sleep and does not clearly activate the record.

HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal rhythmic slowing identified following hyperventilation.
2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
3 Excess background theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are relatively characteristic
of temporal lobe epilepsy and are similar to previous studies.
