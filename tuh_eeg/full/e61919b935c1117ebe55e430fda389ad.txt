MONT SZ DESCRIBE AS FUNNY SMELL, MOUTH WATERY > GTC ACTIVITY
WITH LOC, DURATION 3-5 MINS. PT C/0 PAINT HAT ORIGINATE IN THE
POSTERIOR
Medications: KEPPRA, ZOLOFT, FLEXERIL
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake and drowsy
Technique: International 1 D-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EEG Dept. electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 1OHz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity Is present in the left mid and anterior temporal region (F7/T3 and
T3) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. At times it Is sharply contoured. No
epileptiform discharges are present
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second(fps) does not produce any effect.
Interpretation:
This Is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral is etiologically non-specific.
