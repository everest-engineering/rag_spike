History:	73 year old woman with extensive PMH, now presents with failure to thrive and
reported episode of unresponsiveness.
Medications:	Keppra, Celexa,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal wakefulness, the background consists of 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly with
expected AP gradient.  Diffuse excess theta activity is present.  No normal sleep architecture was
present despite reported clinical sleep.
Intermittent polymorphic moderate-to-high amplitude delta activity is present over the left
hemisphere, most pronounced over the frontotemporal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is excessive diffuse EMG artifact
early in the recording that makes that portion of the study uninterpretable.  There is increased EMG
artifact over the bilateral lateral electrode chains throughout most of the recording.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left frontotemporal
Artifact, EMG, excessive, early in the recording
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 41-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
intermittent moderate left frontotemporal slowing. Diffuse background slowing indicates
etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Intermittent focal slowing is indicative
of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
Excessive EMG artifact which is present during some portions of the recording makes interpretation
of those portions of EEG less reliable and, at times, uninterpretable.
