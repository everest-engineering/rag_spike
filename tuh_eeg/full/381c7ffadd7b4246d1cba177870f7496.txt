History:	58 year old man who presents confused, slurring his speech.  He was found to have
Dilantin toxicity.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
There is  no PDR or AP gradient.  Background activity is characterized by a mixture of polymorphic
diffuse theta and delta activity.  Left sided sleep-spindle-like waveforms are present.
There is paucity of faster frequencies over the right, especially right temporal region.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, especially over the temporal region
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 22-minute  EEG due to moderate diffuse
slowing and continuous focal right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the temporal
region. Diffuse slowing is etiologically nonspecific indicator of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
