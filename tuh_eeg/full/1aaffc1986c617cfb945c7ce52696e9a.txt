History:	FOLLOW UP ON 61 YR OLD FEMALE CONGENITAL, HYDROCEPHALUS, RT
SIDED REVISION. PREVIOUS EVAL FOR NON-EPILEPTIC SZ.
Medications:	Lamotrigine, Aspirin, Tramadol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
occasional focal slowing is present in the right central region during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Right central slowing
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of occasional focal slowing in the right
central region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No electrographic seizures are present.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
