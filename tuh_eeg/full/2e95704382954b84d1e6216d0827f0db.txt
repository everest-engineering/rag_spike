CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old woman with a 1 month history of dull, left temporal headache.  The patient describes a warm sensation followed by the taste of blood and blurry vision in association with her headaches.  COPD, asthma, sleep apnea.



MEDICATIONS: Unknown



INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an open through stage II sleep record in a very drowsy patient.  Hyperventilation was deferred.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles.  Snore arousals were observed.



Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.



Heart rate 72 BPM.



IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The snore arousals and the snore artifact may be part of this patient's underlying sleep disorder.
