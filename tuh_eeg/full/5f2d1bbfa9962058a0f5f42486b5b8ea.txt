CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old with 2 tonic clonic seizure followed by postictal confusion, spinal stenosis, and dementia. Past history of epilepsy not otherwise described.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel  EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  Through much of the awake EEG, there is a well-organized pattern with symmetric reactive alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, and  frontocentral beta.  Intermittently in wakefulness and drowsiness, there is  asymmetry with attenuation of faster frequency activity on the right and a little bit of arrhythmic delta or theta in the same region.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic slowing and some frontal delta.  Other features include an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 BPM, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity in the right hemisphere with a small amount of slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In an older individual with a past history of seizures and cognitive impairment, correlation with imaging is suggested.
