CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old woman, survivor of abuse with recurrent episodes of eye flutter, tremulousness, dropping to the floor with shaking.  Spells last minutes to hours and are associated with prolonged postictal awareness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A 36-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient had 2 events during hyperventilation lasting approximately 1.3 and 6 minutes in duration.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 11 Hz alpha rhythm, a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity, alpha squeak, as well as lambda.  Brief drowsiness was achieved at the end of the record and was characterized by attenuation of the alpha and an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation did not produce pathological findings, but did produce a driving response.
Hyperventilation:  Hyperventilation produced 2 spells of unresponsiveness.  The patient demonstrated eye fluttering, unresponsiveness, impaired ability to recall a code word and jerking of the upper extremities and shaking.  Her companion was with her and reported that these were typical of the patient's spells and, if the patient was standing, the patient would have dropped to the floor.
The patient was examined during the spells.  Although she was unable to recall code word, she demonstrated soft protective movements.  A normal alpha rhythm was noted when she stopped fluttering in her eyes.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This outpatient EEG demonstrated 2 behavioral events with typical clinical characteristics of a nonepileptic seizure and with a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are typical of those seen in nonepileptic seizures.  The patient's primary neurologist was contacted immediately, and the patient was counseled today.
