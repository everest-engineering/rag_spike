History:	57yo F with a Hx of seizures. No seizures since 2009. Describes them as light-
headedness with LOC.
Medications:	dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness and is accentuated by hyperventilation.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates the
intermittent left anterior temporal slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
