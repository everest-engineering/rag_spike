INTRODUCTION: An EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with the EKG electrodes. Awake and asleep record is seen. Photic stimulation was performed.
MEDICATIONS: Advair, Duoneb, Glucophage, Toprol, and Keppra.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: questionable history of seizure. She was found down with confusion and urinary incontinence.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, depression, diabetes, coronary artery disease, status post MI in 2003, CVA in right, MCA stroke in 2006 with residual left-sided weakness.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: Posterior dominant rhythm is seen at 9 to 11 Hz of 20 to 40 microvolts amplitude, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Frontal central beta rhythm is also seen. Stage I sleep is seen. Photic stimulation is normal.
Abnormal discharges: The patient has normal discharge: Focal slow waves are seen in frontotemporal regions bilaterally and independently. No seizures were seen.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to focal slowing seen independently in both hemispheres.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.
