CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old woman with a history of epilepsy since age 11, head trauma, bilateral strokes, refractory epilepsy, and transferred from an outside hospital for refractory seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, ASA, Plavix, Zocor, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake and cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal with primarily a theta frequency background. There is no well-defined alpha rhythm. There are relatively frequent, high-amplitude sharp waves which may be maximal at T2, T4. There is variability in
their field of spread and they spread to involve C4. Occasionally they are picked up in the contralateral temporal region but seem to be maximum on the left. They are sometimes associated with bursts of rhythmic slowing with rhythmic theta or delta when they occur in bursts and trains.
HR: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Moderate background slowing.
2. Paucity of some of the normal wave forms in an awake adult.
3. Sharp waves seen, primarily from the right anterior temporal region but with some which are maximum at T4 rather than T2, FP to F4, or with spread into C4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures. There may be a relatively large area of epileptogenicity for this individual. Given the frequency of this patient's seizures, some of the background slowing may be part of this individual's postictal
state.
