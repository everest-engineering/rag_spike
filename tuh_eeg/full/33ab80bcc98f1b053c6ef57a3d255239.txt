CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old male with repetitive seizures and HIV disease.
MEDICATIONS: Etomidate, Ativan, Rocuronium, Retrovirals, Remeron, Paxil, Norvasc,
Amlodipine, Epzicom, Loperamide, Paroxetine, Fluconazole, Atenolol, Norvir,
Mirtazapine, Reyataz, Diphenoxylate, Hydroxyzine Pamoate, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous
low voltage beta frequency pattern with some head rocking. There is suggestion early
on in the record of some asymmetry in the posterior regions with a bit more delta on the
left.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a diffuse pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The asymmetries described above are of unclear
significance. The technologist reports that the patient was very agitated during the
initial portions of the record and that electrode placement was difficult. Stimulation of
the patient was deferred due to the patient's extreme agitation during the set up. A
follow up EEG may be 'important to characterize epileptiform activity.
