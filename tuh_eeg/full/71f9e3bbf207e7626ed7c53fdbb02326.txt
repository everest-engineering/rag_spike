History:	35 year old woman with episodes of dizziness and sensations of internal shaking.

Of note, patient fell internal shaking during hyperventilation and photic stimulation
today during the exam.
Medications:	Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha rhythm is frequently observed.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Patient reports internal sensation of shaking during both hyperventilation and
photic stimulation with no abnormal changes noted on EEG.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 25-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Patient reports internal sensation of shaking during both
hyperventilation and photic stimulation with no abnormal changes noted on EEG.
