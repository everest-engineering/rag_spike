History:	64 year old man with a history of focal right sided status epilepticus in 12/2014.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region.
Occasional right anterior (Fp2 maximal) and midtemporal (T4 maximal) sharp waves with
aftergoing slow waves are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right temporal, mid
Sharp waves, occasional, right, anterior temporal(Fp2 maximal), midtemporal (T4 maximal)
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG due to continuous moderate right
midtemporal focal slowing and occasional right anterior temporal (Fp2 maximal) and midtemporal
(T4 maximal) epileptiform discharges. These findings indicate focal structural lesion with
epileptogenic potential over the right anterior - midtemporal region.  A single EKG lead
