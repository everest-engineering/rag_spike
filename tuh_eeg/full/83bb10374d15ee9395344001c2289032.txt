FOUR TO 8 WEEKS. LAST SEIZURE 2 WEEKS AGO.PT IS UNCLEAR TO LENGTH
OF SZ, BUT PT WAS CONFUSED FOR A PERIOD AFTER EVENT.
Medications:	LISINOPRIL, PRAVACHOL, PRILOSEC , PROTONIX
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
