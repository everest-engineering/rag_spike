LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Nearly 23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who on 05/21/2013 was noted to be lethargic with associated diffuse twitching after dialysis.  Patient was admitted with AV graft clot.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include heparin, donepezil , levothyroxine.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system, additional T1 and T2 electrode and single EKG lead. Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation  was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There was no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitudes, theta and delta activity, frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) as well as intermittent triphasic wave forms with AP lag.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
FIRDA.
Triphasic wave forms.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, FIRDA and triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction, suspected toxic metabolic in etiology.  FIRDA could be seen in various forms of encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and bilateral deep white matter lesions.  Triphasic wave forms are seen in various forms of encephalopathy.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
