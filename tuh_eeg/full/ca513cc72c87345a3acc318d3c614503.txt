CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed woman with left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Fentanyl, Midazolam,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard CA
montage. New recording begins after the patient has received anesthetic agents.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an overall
continuous pattern with a mixture of theta and delta frequency activity. No focal features
are noted with clamping of the carotid although just at the moment that the carotid is
clamped, there is a bit of discontinuity. The EEG duration was 2 hours and 40 minutes
HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION: EEG monitoring during this carotid
endarterectomy did not identify focal features.
