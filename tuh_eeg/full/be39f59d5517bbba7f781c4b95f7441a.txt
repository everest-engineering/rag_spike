CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old right handed female with epilepsy since childhood.  The patient states she was in a coma for 8 months.  Last seizure about 3 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures, included hyperventilation, but photic stimulation could not be performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening and closing.  The normal frontal central beta is seen.  No sleep is captured. Hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.  Photic stimulation could not be finished due to the patient saying that it may precipitate seizures and did not want to have it.  During the recording while the patient closes her eyes there is side to side movements of the eyes consistent with nystagmus movements.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.
