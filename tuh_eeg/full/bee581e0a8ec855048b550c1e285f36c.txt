CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed female, possible temporal lobe encephalitis.  This is a 73-year-old.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake, no seizures were reported around the time of the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG.  In stage II sleep there are vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.  In relaxed wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz alpha rhythm, a bit more prominent on the left than the right.   The right hemisphere demonstrates superimposed focal slowing, including in the right posterior temporal region.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing in the right is less prominent than on previous studies.  This patient was a bit drowsier during this EEG and this might have explained the fact that it was a bit slower on the left.  She was maximally awake at the very end of the EEG.  No sharp waves or PLEDS seen.
