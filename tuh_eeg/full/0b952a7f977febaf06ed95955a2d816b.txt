CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old woman with staring spell in 2009 and then recurrent
staring spells, rare, subtle, March through December 2010. The patient is functional
during the events, but feels a little funny.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Diamox, Lotrel.
Digital video EEG was performed the lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta
activity. In hyperventilation and in relaxed wakefulness there is a small amount of 5Hz
temporal theta. In hyperventilation, however, there are also rare, subtle discrete left
temporal sharp waves with some associated focal slowing. Features of drowsiness
include slow rolling eye movements. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. In
drowsiness there are a handful wave forms that also resemble benign epileptiform
transients of sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Small amount of rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness.
2. Despite this, what appears to be left temporal sharp waves. I
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there are some normal variants present, the
subtle features identified in hyperventilation suggest a localization related mechanism
for epilepsy.
