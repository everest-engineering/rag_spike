INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a bedside portable in an anxious and apprehensive patient. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, although there is a great deal of muscle and motion artifact, there is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a background with excess beta and excess theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Intermittent sugar artifact is noted.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study is suggested.
