CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old female with dementia with mental status changes.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Lovenox, Plavix, Metoprolol, ASA, Rifaximin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow and disorganized pattern. The overall pattern is a mixture of delta and theta frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle artifact.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. The prominent rhythmicity of the background particularly at the end when the theta frequency activity increases more toward a 6 Hz pattern which is compatible with a chronic dementing illness, but, again, the findings are nonspecific.
