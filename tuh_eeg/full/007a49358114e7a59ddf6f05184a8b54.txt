History:	64 YO FEMALE IN OR FOR PULMONARY THROMBOSIS, ENDARTERECTOMY.
Medications:	PROPOFOL, FENTANYL, VECURONIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As the EEG continues and with anesthesia there is  diffuse admixed 50-75
uV, 4-7Hz activity present with intermixed diffuse faster beta frequencies. The patient begins
cooling at 09:49AM. Some intermittent right frontal sharps and later generalized periodic
discharges are seen as the patient reaches  19.6 degrees (F). At 10:26 the background is completely
suppressed and the primary team is informed. Rewarming commences at 11:55 AM. Symmetric
bursts can be seen by 12:08PM and by 12:29PM the EEG is continuous. There is a slightly lower
amplitude on the  right occipital region but this improves. The background remains moderately
diffusely slow at the end of the record.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged
No focal slowing is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is an intermittent P3 artifact
seen with the cooling pump.
Summary of Findings:
Other, Uneventful EEG during cardiac arrest.
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 4Hr EEG during endarterectomy and cardiac arrest surgery.
