CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old male with a long history of epilepsy since age 20 or 21. Reported cranial injury in the past. Post traumatic epilepsy with strong family history of epilepsy, nonadherent with medications, baseline learning disorder and academic difficulties.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Tylenol, Percocet
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well organized background with an 11 hertz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Mu activity is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing and increase in beta and rare posts. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation produces bilateral background slowing.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION; EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
