History:	52 yo woman c/o falling, eyes fluttering, jaw locking, seeing in "black and white"
upon waking up.

PMHX- DM2, osteoarthritis in pelvis and thigh, COPD, schizophrenia and depression
with suicidal ideations, morbid obesity
Medications:	Gabapentin,insulin, lisinopril,seroquel,protonix,feldene,tramadol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region during
wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of Intermittent polymorphic delta
activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions during wakefulness.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in
