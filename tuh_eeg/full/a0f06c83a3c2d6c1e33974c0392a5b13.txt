REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old man, who presented after a fall from 3 stories, and had loss of consciousness prior to the fall.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for cardiac cath, PE, DVT, prostate cancer, AICD, and seizures in the past.
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, aspirin, Depakote, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and 2 of sleep.  Activating procedures included an photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In most awake state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 9 Hz and is located in the posterior region.  There is low amplitude frontocentral beta activity distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by vertex waves and pulse.  A stage 2 sleep is characterized by K complexes and sleep spindles.  For the most part of the recording, patient was in stage I and stage II of sleep.  Photic stimulation was performed and did not induce any driving response.  There was no seizures or epileptiform discharges seen on this record.
Heart rate is 82 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in awake and stage I and 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are of concern, a long-term monitoring EEG is recommended.
