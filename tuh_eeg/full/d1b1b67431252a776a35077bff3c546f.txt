CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed female with changed of mental status. Evaluate for encephalopathy, past history of epilepsy and endometriosis.

MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Fioricet, Lovenox, Tegretol, Acetaminophen

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a somewhat disorganized background with a mixture of theta and delta. Features of drowsiness include shifting slowing. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate this record. In drowsiness, there are bursts of frontally predominant delta. There is also some shifting slowing in the right posterior temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed in this record. The slowing and disorganization may be due to an underlying metabolic encephalopathy or this patient's chronic neurologic condition. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study as the patient improves from her current clinical
symptoms may be valuable.
