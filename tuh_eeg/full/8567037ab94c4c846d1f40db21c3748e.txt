CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old female with history of Turner syndrome, hyperthyroidism, depression, eating disorder, hearing loss, complaints of numbness of the right arm and right leg for 1 month as well as difficulty grabbing objects with the right side.
MEDICATIONS:  Viactiv, Effexor, Klonopin, Os-Cal, Estradiol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Right-sided numbness and weakness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  At the onset of the recording, there were some parieto-occipital electrode malfunctions which later on improved.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best seen at 5 Hz that appears to react to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  Patient does appear to have normal sleep architecture and goes into the stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the excessive beta can sometimes be seen with the use of barbiturates.
