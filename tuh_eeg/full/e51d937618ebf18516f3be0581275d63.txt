History:	61 YO FEMALE TRANSFERRED FROM CHESTNUT HILL HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF
ONE WEEK OF AMS.  PMHX OF V-P SHUNT IN 1988 DEVICE UNKNOWN. MS.
POST SHUNT REMOVAL.
Medications:	PIPERACILLIN TAZOBACTAM
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the F4 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness. At times it is sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous right frontal focal slowing, which is consistent
with a structural focal dysfunction in that region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
