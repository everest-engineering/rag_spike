History:	61 year old woman with a history of chronic and, now, acute, strokes. Her mental status remains poor and her neurological exam fluctuates.
Medications:  ASA, no AEDs Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for -24 hours from 4/29/2015 till 4/30/2015.  NursingÂ­ initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient. The background consists primarily of polymorphic diffuse theta activity, occasional polymorphic alpha activity and bursts of diffuse frontally predominant delta activity (FIRDA).  During sleep, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with normal sleep architecture.  Sleep is fragmented and patient is awake for most of the night hours.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate No electrographic seizures
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous -24 hour video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction,which is etiologically nonspecific. FIRDA is could be seen in encephalopathy, increased ICP, bilateral deep white matter lesions. No electrographic seizures are present.	;
