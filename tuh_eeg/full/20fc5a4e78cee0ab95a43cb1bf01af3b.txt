CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old deaf-mute with epilepsy since age 16.  Seizures attributed to a fall down the stairs.  Past history of alcoholism, dementia, depression.  Two seizures in February and in December when she was not taking her medications.  Seizures characterized by aura of flashing, blinking white lights.  Previously on Depakote associated with somnolence.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, Keppra, Ibuprofen, Iophen, Levothyroxine, Folic Acid, Levetiracetam,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, there is a low voltage pattern with minimal alpha.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic central followed by beta.  Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  Posts are also seen.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response which begins at 1 Hz.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Well-defined alpha was not identified today.  This may have been due to communication difficulties more than anything else.  Hyperventilation was successfully completed, however, and produced only a small increase in what was otherwise a somewhat low voltage record.
