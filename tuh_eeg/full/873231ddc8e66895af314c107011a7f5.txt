intraventricular shunt, evaluate for sedation and sepsis.
MEDICATIONS: None listed
Tel (215)707-4523
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake and
interactive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow, somewhat
disorganized. There is primarily a rhythmic theta frequency pattern with 6-8 Hz activity
and a glimpse of a 6Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is some shifting slowing and
some arrhythmic delta activity more prominent on the right. In addition, a breech rhythm
is identified on the right. Occasional sharp waves are noted on the right at F8, T21T4.
Chewing artifact is not associated with ictal activity. The patient is somewhat
inattentive. As he becomes drowsy, the intrahemispheric asymmetry is a bit more
prominent with more disruption of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the
left.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal features with focal slowing on the right.
3. Rare sharp waves on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies. No
seizures were recorded.
