CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old gentleman with meningioma identified August 2010,
currently seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 alpha rhythm with a
small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. A breech rhythm is identified in
the left frontocentral region with accentuation of faster frequency activity. Photic
stimulation does elicit a driving response. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude of the background. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
In the section of the record with photic stimulation, which is performed at the end of the
record, the patient is finally starting to get a little drowsy and his skull defect is a bit
more prominent there and there is a slight asymmetry in frontocentral theta with
somewhat slower 3Hz activity in the left frontal region when compared to the right.
HR: 90 bpm
Very subtly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle left frontocentral theta identified in drowsiness only.
CLINICAL There are no epileptiform features identified. The breech
rhythm and the focal features described above are anticipated findings following the
neurosurgical intervention.
