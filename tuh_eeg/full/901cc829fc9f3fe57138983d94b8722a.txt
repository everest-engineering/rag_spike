CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old male admitted on May 17, 2012 with opiate overdose, evaluate for anoxic brain injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lorazepam, Heparin, Famotidine, Vancomycin, Propofol, Midazolam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage and relatively featureless.  There is eye movement and muscle artifact.  At least 1 section of the record, there is a suggestion of lower voltage rhythmic 3 Hz demonstrated bilaterally.
Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.  The variability is as described above.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Paucity of cerebral activity.
Rare areas with lower voltage delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were noted.  There is a bit more cerebral activity in
this EEG in comparison to his previous study, but overall this remains a fixed and extremely worrisome pattern.
