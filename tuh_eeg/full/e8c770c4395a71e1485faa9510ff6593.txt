History: 68 year old woman with history of stroke, seizures, depression, now presents with confusion.
Medications: Keppra, Paxil, Crestor, Depakote, Vimpat, Lopressor, Lisinopril, Insulin, Metformin, Albuterol, Aspirin
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine. awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of 9 Hz alpha activity over the right and 6-8.5 Hz activity over the left. There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes activity. During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region. No clear epileptiform discharges are present
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of fewer than 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate. left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG because of continuous moderate focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is Indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and is consistent with patients history of stroke in that region. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
