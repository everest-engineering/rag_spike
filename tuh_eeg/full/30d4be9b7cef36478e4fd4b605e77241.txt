REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stroke in 2011, left occipital and temporal with also a history of coronary artery disease, CABG and seizures, who presented with right-sided weakness and aphasia after having a seizure described as a right gaze deviation followed by tonic clonic movement of the left upper extremity.

MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Coreg, atorvastatin and heparin.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the additional of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an abnormal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep, although no normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp waves seen continuously at 1 Hz over F7/T3 at a frequency of 1 Hz.  This is consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's).

SEIZURES:  None.

HEART RATE:  72.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal PLED's and generalized slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region, in addition to focal cerebral dysfunction and acute focal irritability over the left anterior temporal region.  There also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.

The primary team was informed about this recording and continuous 24 hour EEG monitoring will be started.
