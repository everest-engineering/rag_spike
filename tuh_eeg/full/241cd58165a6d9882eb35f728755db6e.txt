History:	58 year old female with an episode of loss of consciousness, subsequently found to
have left temporal meningioma s/p resection 6/4/2014. Patient only complaints of
mild headaches.
Medications:	Keppra, Zolpidem, Cymbalta, Tramadol
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low-to-moderate moderate amplitude polymorphic 11-11.5
Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  The AP gradient is unstable.
Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, there is increase in
theta activity diffusely.
Intermittent bursts of bitemporal and diffuse polymorphic theta/ delta activity are captured.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and increases the degree of
diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Other, bursts of bitemporal and diffuse theta/ delta activity
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 26 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
bitemporal and diffuse bursts of slowing. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings could also be seen in excessively drowsy patients.
Please correlate clinically.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not
recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
