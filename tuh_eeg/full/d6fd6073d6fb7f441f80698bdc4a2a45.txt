CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed woman with childhood epilepsy, 4 tonic clonic seizures since August 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Singulair, Lisinopril, Tylenol #3, Ciprofloxacin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 10.7 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. This EEG is remarkable for brief bursts of brief higher amplitude proximal mixed frequency sharply contoured slowing primarily in the theta frequency. The activity is somewhat asynchronous and sometimes seems to be a little slower in the right posterior quadrant. In addition, on rare occasions, there is a right frontal sharp wave. There is also a single high amplitude right central temporal spike and slow wave complex noted. These bursts of proximal slowing were seen in relaxed wakefulness and in the transition toward sleep. They were quite prominent around the time of hyperventilation that did not seem to be activated by hyperventilation. As the patient transitions in and out of torrid sleep, some of the paroxysmal bursts were associated with a right anterior temporal sharp wave.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Bursts of paroxysmal irregular mixed frequency primarily theta frequency activity.
2. Focal features in these paroxysmal bursts with a little bit more slowing on the right
3. Rare sharp waves which include right frontal and right mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Fragments of this pathology was seen in the first EEG, but these findings are much more prominent clearly defined today.
