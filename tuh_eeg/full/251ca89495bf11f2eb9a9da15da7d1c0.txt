CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old with glioblastoma multiforme, recurrent tumor, failure to thrive and likely underlying infection.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Dilantin, Decadron, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  digital video EEG  was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory bedside portable record for patient on supplemental oxygen with frequent coughing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG is diffusely slow, low voltage, with a prominent breach rhythm, with accentuation of beta activity in the right central temporal region.  Intermittent sharp waves were noted in the right hemisphere, typically maximum at C4 but with involvement of C4, T4, and T6.  Cough artifact was noted intermittently in the record.
The overall EEG is markedly slow and low voltage, higher amplitude in the right hemisphere.
Heart rate: 104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Sharp waves in the right central temporal region.
Generalized background slowing, bihemispheric.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The sharp are in the region of the brain tumor.  The breach rhythm identified in the right is congruent with the previous craniotomy history.  No seizures were recorded.  The generalized background slowing is compatible with a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.
