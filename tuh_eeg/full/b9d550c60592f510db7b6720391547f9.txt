History:	64 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SUDDEN ONSET OF RIGHT WEAKNESS
NOTED WITH LEFT HAND TREMOR EEG TO R/O SZ.  RECENT DISCHARGE.
PMHX SIG FOR NEW RT CEREBELLAR INFARCT, OLD LT INFARCT
FOLLOW UP EEG 10/6 IP
Medications:	NO AED, HEPARIN, ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
The predominant background is characterized by a 8.5-9 Hz, 25-40uV symmetric alpha rhythm with
good attenuation on eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-
7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During limited stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Intermittent shifting polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral temporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse, Excess theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bilateral temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific. In addition there’s is diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG.
