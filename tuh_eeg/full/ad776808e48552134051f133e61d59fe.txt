History:	74 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF SZ. P/W SZ IN AM OG 2/16 EYES ROLLED UP + SHAKING FOR 1-2 MIN. FOLLOWED BY CONFUSION FOR A FEW MINS. - TONGUE BITE. LAST SZ 6 MONTHS AGO. PT WAS NOT COMPLIANT ON MEDS.
Medications:	KEPPRA, FOSAMAX, NORVASC, PROVENTIL, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present at F7 during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent epileptiform discharges in the left frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
