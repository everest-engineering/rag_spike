CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male who had a traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage with associated infarct while intoxicated. This was followed by a seizure on an unknown date.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is a technically difficult EEG due to the patient's matted hair style as well as his hard collar.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG with the patient resting quietly includes a medium amplitude mixed frequency pattern with primarily theta and smaller amounts of delta. Stimulation of the patient produces eye opening, muscle artifact and a brief glimpse of an alpha rhythm. As he drifts off to sleep, there are features of vertex waves and some bursts of shifting, frontal delta.

HR: 56-90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Please consider a followup study following discharge to further evaluate the potential underlying epileptiform activity.
