History:	56 YO MALE WAS AT A BAR WHEN HE COLLAPSED OFF STOOL.HE WAS DOWN
5 MIN. BEFORE EMS ARRIVAL AT WHICH TIME HE WAS FOUND TO BE IN
ASYSTOLE.CPR WAS INITIATED W 3 ROUNDS OF EPI AND ROSC WAS
ACHIEVED. UPON ARRIVAL HE WAS HYPOTHERMIC 94.3 & LATER
Medications:	DILANTIN,LOVENOX,LORAZEPAM ,VECURONIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Periodic central maximal (with a large posterior field) synchronous
complex polyphasic sharp waves with a repetition rate of 1-2 Hz.  There is a myogenic artifact
associated to the discharges and on video the patient exhibit subtle jerks, consistent with
myoclonus.  There are intermittent bursts lasting 1-13 seconds. The bursts are composed of low
amplitude complex fast beta frequency polyspikes that appear to be maximal at CZ, P3 and P4. No
video correlate is seen.  These are consistent with electrographic seizures.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  The patient received vecuronium which removed the myogenic artifact
from the discharges.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, continuous, electrographic central and parietal
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous, central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent subclinical electrographic seizures arising from
the central and parietal region.  These findings are indicative of an epileptogenic focus in this
region, and are consistent with subclinical status epilepticus. In addition there are  continuous
periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) that are central maximal with associated myoclonus.  In the
setting of hypoxic injury these findings are indicative of diffuse cortical irritability and dysfunction
which is suggestive of a very poor prognosis.
