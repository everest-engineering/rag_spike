TIME OF RECORDING:  11:20
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old male with epilepsy since age 16 admitted with 5 generalized tonic clonic seizures on January 17, 2013 after he ran out of Depakote for 2 months.  The patient had a seizure at 9:55 this morning lasting 15-20 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, midazolam, Truvada, Reyataz.
INTRODUCTION:  EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was drowsy.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern with generous beta and eye rolling artifact, generous 16 and 17 Hz beta is noted in the background.  Arousals produce a small amount of 4.5 Hz theta activity bilaterally, 17 Hz spindle like activity is noted in the background
At the end of the record the patient is awakening a bit and there is some 12 Hz activity noted in the background.
Heart rate:  84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for excess beta.
No epileptiform features were identified.  The excess beta in a drowsy patient after a tonic clonic seizure maybe due to the use of benzodiazepines.  To more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a follow up study when the patient is able to come to the lab is suggested.
