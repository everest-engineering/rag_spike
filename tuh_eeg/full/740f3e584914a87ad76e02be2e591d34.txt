History:	72 YO PT AWAKE THE NIGHT BEFORE W / RIGHT HAND NUMBNESS AND
HEAVINESS. PT C/O HEADACHE AND DOUBLE VISION WITH NUMBNESS IN
OTHER BODY PARTS. PT TO HAVE CAROTID SURGERY 6/18. EEG BASELINE.
Medications:	CBZ, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  Brief arousals are characterized by
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 70.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
