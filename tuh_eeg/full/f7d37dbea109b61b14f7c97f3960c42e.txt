History:	62 year old woman undergoing left carotid endarterectomy.
Medications:	MIDAZOLAM,FENTANYL 25 MG, PROPOFOL,ROCURONIUM,PROTAMINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Patient is intubated when the recording opens.  The background
throughout the recording consists of a mixture of frequencies and some periods of discontinuity.
Internal carotid is clamped at ~1:09 PM.  There is no change in the background.  By 2:22:40 PM,
both internal and external carotid arteries are unclamped.  There is a sudden change in the
background at ~ 3:15 PM.  It is characterized by appearance of diffuse polymorphic delta activity.
This change corresponds to change in anesthesia administered.  By  the end of the recording, there
is increase in EMG artifact and patient appears awake with fragmented PDR present.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 4 hour continuous intraoperative EEG recording.  EEG was reviewed remotely
live by the attending at and following the clamping of the left internal carotid artery (~ 15 min
total); at the time of unclamping of the left carotid artery and the last 30 minutes of the recording.
There was no change in the background at the time of clamping and unclamping the left internal
