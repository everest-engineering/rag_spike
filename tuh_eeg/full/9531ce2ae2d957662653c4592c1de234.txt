CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 36-year-old woman, who developed double vision, disorientation, eyes rolled back in head and fell down stairs.  Past history of anxiety and depression.  Evaluate for seizure versus syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Tylenol, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient had great scalp tenderness and impedances under 10 kilohms were obtained, but not lower than this.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record, but maximal wakefulness, there is a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background theta and beta.  Vertex waves and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Technically somewhat challenging, but normal EEG primarily in drowsiness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing in the lab as an outpatient may be considered.
