CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old, right handed gentleman, with Lyme disease, small subdural hematoma and visual hallucinations, right sided subdural hematoma.  Acute onset visual hallucinations this past week.
MEDICATIONS:  Ancef, gentamicin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz, 40 mV posterior dominant with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta.
Wicket and sharply contoured eye movements were observed.  Brief vertex waves were observed in the transition in and out of sleep.
Exceedingly rare, right posterior parietal occipital focal delta with slight disruption of the alpha rhythm was noted in the transition to drowsiness.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in the amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due to:  Rare subtle focal slowing noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Wicket and sharply contoured eye movements are a normal variant.  The subtle, focal slowing in the right parietal occipital region may be correlated with imaging. Long term video EEG was requested in an attempt to capture one of this patient's episodes of visual hallucinations.
