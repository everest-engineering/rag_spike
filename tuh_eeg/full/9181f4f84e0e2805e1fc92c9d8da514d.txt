DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 hertz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. Normal frontocentral beta is seen. Wakefulness is only recorded. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
