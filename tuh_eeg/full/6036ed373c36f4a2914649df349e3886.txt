History:	33 year old with a history of deja-vu episodes and episodes of abnormal smells.
Medications:	Prilosec
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional left anterior temporal polymorphic theta-delta activity is noted.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal, anterior
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG because of occasional mild focal slowing
in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on
a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
