History:	FOLLOW UP EEG ON 65 YR OLD F S/P FALL WITH LOC. HX: LEFT ICJ, VP SHUNT, DM, SZ, PE. Skull Defect (Burr Hole) at F4
Medications:	Vimpat, Dilantin.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, drowsy, lethargic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the T3 more than T4 region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.

Summary of Findings: Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent independent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild  excessive theta in wakefulness which is suggestive for mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non specific with ________
