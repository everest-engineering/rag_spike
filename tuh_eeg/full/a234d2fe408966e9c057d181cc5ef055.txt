CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 86-year-old woman with previous large, right, PCA/MCA infarct with gliosis, and acute left posterior infarct with a small degree of hemorrhagic conversion, but with significant mass effect and edema, rapid atrial fibrillation, nonverbal.

MEDICATIONS:  none reported

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was awake, but nonverbal.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  It includes generous theta and beta frequency activity.  It is overall sharply contoured record.  Superimposed upon this, there is marked arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the right posterior quadrant.  There is also shifting slowing noted in the left hemisphere through the central regions.  Occasional sharp waves are noted at T6 and occasionally at F8.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Overall, this is a dynamic record with some sections of the record showing more fast activity and others a bit slower.  There is a subtle underlying phase reversal also noted at P3/T5.

Heart rate irregular 105 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with primarily a theta/beta frequency pattern.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity noted independently from each hemisphere, but right posterior more so than left.
3. Bursts of generalized arrhythmic delta activity.
4. Occasional sharp waves noted particularly right posterior temporal or left parietal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The epileptiform activity identified above is not continuous or periodic and it is seen in the regions of this patient's known CNS pathology.  If additional information is needed, other recording strategies may be employed.
