History:	58 YO MALE P/W R GAZE, R HEMIPARESIS. R ARM AND LEG STIFF IN AIR.
RESOLVED WITH ATIVAN 2 MG X2.  PMH: LEFT STROKE ACA/MCA
TERRITORY, HTN, OSA
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some sleep was captured with vertex waves and some spindle were seen best on the
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the
right midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to verbal
stimuli  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left frontotemporal region.
This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in
origin. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are
indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
