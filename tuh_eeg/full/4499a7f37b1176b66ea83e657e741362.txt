CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 8 and tonoclonic seizures.  A recent seizure last month, banging into the wall with tonic extension of extremities followed by apnea and then confusion.  Subsequent difficulty moving the right side of the body.  Mental retardation, heart disease, scoliosis and developmental delay following major childhood illness at age 3, and microcephaly.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, Depakote, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is a very challenged EEG in a patient who had difficulty cooperating.  Her mother worked with her as did the tech trying to get her to hold still.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG lacks the normal developmental milestones for an adult of this age.  There is prominent, frontocentral beta.  There is a glimpse of a 5-6 Hz low voltage rhythm in the posterior regions, but it is difficult to determine whether or not this is reactive to eye opening.  Prominent lateral reactive eye movement artifact was noted.  Sleep could not be achieved.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Absence of the normal waveforms anticipated for an adult of this age.
Excess beta.
Slowing of what may be the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In this individual with right hemibody symptoms, there were no significant focal features.
