AGE: 26 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/11/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1800
HISTORY:
26 y.o. male with a history of CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY. LAST SZ WAS 2 WEEKS AGO. He A FEELING OF THERE BEING PEOPLE AROUND HIM LAUGHING AT HIM, HE THEN PASSES OUT. HE HAS
GENERALIZED SHAKING WITH tongue BITING, NO incontinence. NO OTHER PMHX. NO FAMILY HX. referred for routine EEG for characterization of seizures.
MEDICATIONS: KEPPRA
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG HV and photic stimulation.
There is a great deal of muscle artifact noted in relax wakefulness and drowsiness.	The patient seems very drowsy
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.

Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Produces muscle artifact
Photic Stimulation: Elicits harmonic and supra harmonic driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of Â· epilepsy.
