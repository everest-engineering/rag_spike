History:	63 year old with a history of HIV and ESRD on HD, now presents with worsening
confusion.
Medications:	HAART, metoprolol, Insulin, atorvastatin, ASA, Plavix, Heparin, Raltegravir
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Voltages are diffusely very low and background is continuous.  During arousals, 6-7 Hz unstable low
amplitude PDR is noted with weak AP gradient.  Additional polymorphic theta activity and some
delta activity are noted.  Sleep is characterized by diffuse attenuated delta activity and several K-
complexes.  Additionally, fragments of slow wave sleep are captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Occasional premature QRS
complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this patient could
be related to excessive drowsiness (given the fact that deeper stages of sleep were captured).
Occasional premature QRS complexes are captured on a single EKG lead.
