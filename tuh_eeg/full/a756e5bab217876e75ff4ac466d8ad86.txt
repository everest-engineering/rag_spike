CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with depression and OCD.  Patient now with new-onset episodes of dizziness occurring 3 times per month.  Patient has fainted twice.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha supra-harmonic was noted on occasion.  Mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Lambda was also seen in wakefulness.
Drowsiness was characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by brief stage 1 sleep and very brief stage 2 sleep with spindles and K complexes and POSTS.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.  Hyperventilation produced rhythmic slowing of the background.  On one occasion, there was a subtle suggestion of an asymmetry in hyperventilation.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Multiple normal variants were identified.  This was a somewhat cold environment, and shiver artifact was also noted.
