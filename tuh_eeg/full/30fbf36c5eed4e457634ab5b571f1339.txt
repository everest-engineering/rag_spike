CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old female with abrupt right sided weakness, change in mental status and twitching of the right hand, evaluate for stroke versus seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In this bedside recording, the patient seems somewhat lethargic. Head and body turned to the left, but she does move the right arm. The background EEG is markedly disorganized and includes at times some more rhythmic data interrupted by bursts of arrhythmic delta activity. The record demonstrates sharply contoured activity and some slow periodic sharp complexes which may be seen in the right and in the left temporal regions. The periodic complexes or sharp waves do not appear to be particularly linked and at least initially, are more prominent in the right and then later, a little bit more prominent on the left. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Heart rate irregular at 90 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Nonspecific finding can be due to toxic or metabolic or other diffuse brain process.
