CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unknown age male, status post trauma with seizures, now with right craniectomy and ventriculostomy, also bilateral subdural hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Phenytoin, Gentamicin, Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded when he was unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV, at times better seen over the left hemisphere than the right.  In addition, there is intermittent periods where there is faster frequencies in the alpha and beta maximally frontally.  There does not appear to be any improvement in frequencies directly related to painful stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves at F7/T3 at times more C3 seen intermittently.
Focal sharp waves at F7/T3-C3 also seen occasionally.
Generalized slow waves seen at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV with an asymmetry in amplitudes seen better over the left than the right hemisphere.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Focal sharp waves and slow waves over the left anterior and central regions with additional loss of faster frequency over the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of
focal structural dysfunction of the left hemisphere and possible cortical dysfunction over the right hemisphere.  No seizures were seen.
