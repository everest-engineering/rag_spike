CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old gentleman with head trauma, left skull defect,
bedridden for the past 20 years. Evaluate his underlying epileptiform focus.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Norvasc, Metoprolol, AS .
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow bilaterally with an
intra hemispheric asymmetry. There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 7-8 Hertz better
represented on the right than the left. There is more disruption of faster frequency
activity on the left compared to the right. There appears to be a breach rhythm in the
right hemisphere with beta accentuation in the central temporal regions but also a
handful of right central sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response better
identified on the right than the left.
HR: 8 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. An asymmetry with slower activity and more delta on the left.
3. Sharp waves are identified today in the right central region.
4. Breach rhythm which today appears to be on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a little bit less arrhythmic delta on the left
compared to the right today. Epileptiform activity has been identified for this patient
from both hemispheres and this would support bi-hemispheric injury in this debilitated
individual.
