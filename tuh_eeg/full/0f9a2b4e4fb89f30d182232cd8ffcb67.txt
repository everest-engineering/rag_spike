CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old man with an episode of syncope, falls, and a history of hypertension, diabetes, and auditory hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Benztropine, Trazodone, Insulin, Lovenox, Protonix
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope and auditory hallucinations.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen occasionally at T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent left midtemporal delta or focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
