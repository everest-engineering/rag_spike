CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old left handed woman with a long neurologic history,
including seizures following right MCA stroke, focal facial twitching, now status post
code on May 20, 2010 at 11:00 a.m. for 30 minutes, aortic aneurysm.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and has
very subtle body movements. The patient is positioned with her head turned away from
the video camera.
OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage
pattern with slow delta and smaller amounts of theta. There is some lower voltage 4-5
Hz activity in the frontal central regions. Some secretions of the record demonstrate
muscle. In review of the video the muscle demonstrates what seems to be a very subtle
movement of the head and then some movements of the oral facial muscles. Rare
triphasic waves are noted. Stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A marked slow background.
2. Episodic behaviors with an increase in muscle, but without an epileptiform
signature.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral
dysfunction. However, the behaviors in question, which are 30-00 seconds in duration,
are not epileptiform in nature.
