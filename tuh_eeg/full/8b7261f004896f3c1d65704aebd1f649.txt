HISTORY:  A 31-year-old right-handed woman with 2 seizures, possibly related to PCP use.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a very drowsy adult.
Medication: NONE REPORTED
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta and slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation: elicited symmetric vigorous driving
Heart rate:  96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal wake and sleep EEG in drowsy adults
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen, though this does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy
