CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old woman with migraine headache, diagnosed with diabetes.  The patient has now developed episodes in sleep where she is gasping for air, has pain in her head and demonstrates twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Zyrtec, Topamax, metformin, Valtrex, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL:  This is an acceptable EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient seems to be very drowsy, she was falling asleep prior to hyperventilation and is falling asleep during hyperventilation.  Following hyperventilation rhythmic central theta was followed by vertex waves.  Spontaneous arousals were noted from stage 1 sleep.  A scant amount of artifact which may represent a snore was noted, but audible snoring was not identified on the video.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep and demonstrated harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.  The patient started to transition back into stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  This individual appeared to be quite sleepy as would be the case if this were a sleep deprived individual, an individual sleep deprived for this study or a person with an underlying sleep disturbance.  If additional information is needed a repeat study in the lab may be of value.
