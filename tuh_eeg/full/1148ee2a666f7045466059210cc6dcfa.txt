CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old male found to be on the floor unresponsive, with a past medical history of lung cancer, diabetes, CHF, and right parietal mass with edema.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dexamethasone, Metoprolol, Plavix, Lipitor, Isordil, Neo-Synephrine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Unresponsiveness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz seen best over the right hemisphere and not seen over the left hemisphere.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen mainly over the posterior quadrant in the left hemisphere, maximally at P3, with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-30 mV.  There is no associated loss of faster frequency in this region.
P3 sharp waves seen occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left posterior quadrant slowing seen maximal in the parietal region with associated loss of faster frequencies in addition to sharp waves on the same region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of  acute focal structural (involving gray and white matter) dysfunction in the left parietal region, which is consistent with the known tumor.  No seizures or epileptiform activity was seen.
