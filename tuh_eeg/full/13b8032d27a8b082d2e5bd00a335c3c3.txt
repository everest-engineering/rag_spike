History:	PT. RESIDING IN NURSING HOME. ENCEPHALOPATHY, POST TRAUMATIC
SEIZURES, NEUROGENIC BLADDER, ANXIETY, HTN, CEREBROVASCULAR
DISEASE, TRACH COLLAR.
Medications:	RISPERDAL, VIMPAT, VALPROIC ACID, ATIVAN, LORAZEPAM, MORPHINE,
ASA, ZOFRAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No definitive posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by
diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good
cooperation, and produces no effect.  Throughout the recording the patient is witnessed to sing,
speak, and grimace repeatedly causing motion artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
