CLINICAL HISTORY:  84 year old woman with subdural hematomas and relatively abrupt lethargy and aphasia.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow.  The right hemisphere includes rhythmic 6 Hz activity and smaller amounts of delta activity.  A breach rhythm is noted on the left.  There are occasional bursts of left midtemporal sharp waves which can be broadly contoured.  They may be maximal at T1, T3 or F7.  There are also substantial portions of the record without sharp waves.  Arrhythmic delta is prominent in the left frontotemporal region.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Focal slowing from the left temporal region.
Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures.  If there are additional concerns a follow up EEG may be of value.
