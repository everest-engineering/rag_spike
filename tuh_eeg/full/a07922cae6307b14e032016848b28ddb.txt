History:	53 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF SZS. SINCE TODDLER.  PT STATES HAS BEEN
MISSING MEDS DUE TO INS ISSUES AND HAVING EPISODES OF WAKING UP
WITH BED WET. FALLING AND HEADACHES.  SEEING NEURO 7/17
Medications:	DIVALPROEX, LAMOTRIGINE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, asleep,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG
does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
