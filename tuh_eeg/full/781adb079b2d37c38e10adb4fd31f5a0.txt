History:	60 year old woman presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	fentanyl, aspirin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
During brief arousals, the background consists of polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude 8-9 Hz
PDR with excess polymorphic theta activity and weak AP gradient.  Sleep is captured throughout
the majority of the recording.  It is characterized by diffuse theta and delta activity with intermittent
sleep spindles and K-complexes.  Patient rapidly transitions into drowsiness and sleep.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
this is an abnormal mostly asleep and briefly awake 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but,
in this patient, it is at least partially related to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
