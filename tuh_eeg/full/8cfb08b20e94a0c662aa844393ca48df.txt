History:	65 year old man with a history of a recent stroke.
Medications:	NO AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Occasional independent bitemporal polymorphic theta activity is captured during drowsiness.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Mild degree of bitemporal slowing is considered normal in
individuals 65 years old and over.
