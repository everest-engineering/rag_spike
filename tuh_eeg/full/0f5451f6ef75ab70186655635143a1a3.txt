CLINICAL HISTORY:   32-week conceptional and 24-week gestational age baby boy who presents with decreased fetal tones, floppy cyanotics, and a heart rate of 70, intubated, placed on phenobarbital for possible seizures, now being off medication.
MEDICATIONS:  Currently on caffeine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  An EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EMG, EOG, EKG, and respiratory electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep including active and quiet sleep were recorded.  The patient's gestational age was 24 weeks and conceptional age is 32.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Excessive movement artifact and ICU artifacts throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Normal findings.  During wakefulness, there is mixed frequency moderate to high amplitude activity present which is mainly continuous. There is monorhythmic occipital delta activity which sometimes can be incorporated into posterior delta brushes.  The inter-burst intervals between the bursts may be no longer than 8 seconds and fairly symmetric. Although there are some asymmetric bursts, they do not reach more than 20% of the recording.  Some scattered temporal and central sharp waves are seen, as well as, as mentioned before, delta brushes in the occipital and temporal region and some encoches frontales. During quiet sleep, there is noticeable trace discontinue patterns.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:    No seizures were seen.
