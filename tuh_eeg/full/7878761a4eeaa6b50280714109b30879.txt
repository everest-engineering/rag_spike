CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 66-year-old male with epilepsy, previously found down, now admitted with seizures.  History of epilepsy and traumatic brain injury, former boxer.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG monitoring was performed at the bedside in the monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was at times a bit confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness and sleep:  This is a dynamic record.  The initial sections of the record, the patient is quite drowsy with a slow background but by the morning of the 18th, he is more consistently awake with eye opening, eye closure and a 9 Hz alpha rhythm at times.  Generous beta was noted.
Interictal findings:  Particularly in the initial section of the record, there is a very slow background with a prominent, left anterior temporal sharp wave.  Sometimes this is an F7 maximum, at times a bit FT1.  Some of the sharp waves are nearly isoelectric T1, T3.  Others are small, discrete almost suggesting a breach rhythm or artifact.  In the initial section of the record, particularly while the patient is drowsy, there is a periodic nature to them.
Spontaneous arousals were not seizures.
Heart rate: 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This long term video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
Prominent epileptiform activity from the left, particularly left frontal or left temporal, at times periodic.
Focal slowing from the left temporal region.
Background slowing, more marked in the initial sections of the record, improving over time.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a dynamic record for postictal individual and demonstrates a resolving postictal state.
