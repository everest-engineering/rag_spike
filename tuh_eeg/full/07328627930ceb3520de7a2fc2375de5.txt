CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with transient TIA like symptoms.  MRI and angiogram identified no new ischemic changes as an outpatient.
MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone, Celecoxib, methotrexate, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 9.5 Hertz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Drowsiness was characterized by anterior spread of alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy or stroke.
