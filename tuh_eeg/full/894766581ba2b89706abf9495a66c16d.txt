INTRODUCTION:
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with additional EKG and anterior
temporal electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep stage I and stage II were recorded and photic stimulation and hyperventilation activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:
Frequent T4 electrode artifact
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin.
HISTORY:
A 31-year-old with history of seizures since childhood, presents with seizures on March 2011, follow-up EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The record opens to a well-formed 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which is symmetrically reactive to eye opening and closing. There is a small amount of frontocentral beta. Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage I. Activating procedures
including hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
