History:	76 year old woman who had 3 episodes concerning for seizures in a single day in
10/2015.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Nearly continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the bilateral temporal regions.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a regular
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral temporal, mild-to-moderate
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 49-minute EEG due to nearly continuous mild-to-moderate focal
bilateral temporal slowing. Even though some degree of bitemporal slowing is acceptable in
individuals over the age of 65 year old, this degree of focal slowing is excessive.  This finding is
indicative of focal structural lesions in bitemporal regions.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a
