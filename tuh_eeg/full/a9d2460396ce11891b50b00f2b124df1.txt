CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old right handed female, college professor, with rapidly progressive dementia, Parkinsonian features, visual hallucinations, REM behavior disorder, and family history of rapidly progressive dementia.  Evaluate for Lewy body dementia, myoclonus.
MEDICATIONS:  Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a cooperative individual.  No myoclonus was observed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of 7 Hz activity in wakefulness. Drowsiness is characterized by occasional bursts of theta. Hyperventilation elicits scant theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Very mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  The background theta is a nonspecific finding and can be seen in dementia of many different causes.  In addition, it can be seen with the use of psychiatric medications.
