CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed woman with previous left parietal meningioma resected 7 years ago, past history of right leg twitching, depression

MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Accupril, Zetia, Singular, Zoloft, Pravachol, Lantus

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. MU activity is observed, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  There is a slight asymmetry with a bit more anterior spread of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous, bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A breech rhythm may account for the asymmetries described above.  Supraharmonic driving is a normal phenomenon.
