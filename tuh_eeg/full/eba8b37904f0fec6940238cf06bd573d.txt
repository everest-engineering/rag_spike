CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old woman with multiple GBM resections, repeat resection this morning, now with fever, white count and encephalopathy, acute postoperative patient
MEDICATIONS: Baclofen, Depakote, Decadron, Avelox, Dyazide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates primarily a
theta frequency background with arrhythmic delta activity in a relatively featureless pattern from the right frontotemporal region. In the context of a breech rhythm there are occasional sharp waves in the right centrotemporal region. Arrhythmic delta activity is noted in the right centrotemporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase right centrotemporal sharp waves frequencies.
HR: 66bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity in centrotemporal region.
3. Right centrotemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Epileptiform activities in the region of the patient's acute craniotomy. No seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance in cerebral function as well as a focal process in the right hemisphere.
