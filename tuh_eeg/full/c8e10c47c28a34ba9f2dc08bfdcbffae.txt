CLINICAL HISTORY:  Elderly woman with severe heart failure, advanced dementia and recurrent syncopal spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Carvedilol, Lovenox, atorvastatin, hydralazine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient was confused.
TECHNICAL:  This was a technically acceptable EEG with a small amount of muscle.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background is diffusely slow with an alpha rhythm of approximately 8 Hz.  There is intermittent, underlying arrhythmic delta activity with an asymmetry, a somewhat lower voltage record on the left in comparison to the right.  In addition, rhythmic delta on the left is sometimes more sustained than that seen on the right.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at intermediate flash frequencies.
Heart rate:  96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting asymmetries with a decrease in amplitude on the left.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen as a postictal pattern.  They may also be seen in an individual with advanced dementia.  The asymmetries described above may be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were noted.
