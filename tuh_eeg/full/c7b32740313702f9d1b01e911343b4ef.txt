History:	40 year old woman with events concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, levothyroxine, azithioprine, prednisone, enalapril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast and slow alpha variant is noted.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and prominent 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, especially over the
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
