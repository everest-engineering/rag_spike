History:	52 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O CEREBRAL PALSY, TOTAL HIP
REPLACEMENT 2009, SZ D/O.  LAST SZ X 4 MOS. AGO W/LOC AND NO RECALL
OF EVENT. PMHX SIG FOR ASTHMA/SOB.
Medications:	DILANTIN, TYLENOL 4, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  .
Intermittent runs of rhythmic, monomorphic theta activity, lasting 3-8 seconds, were seen at Cz in
wakefulness and drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 78
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Other, Central Theta is most consistent with a Ciganek rhythm
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. The central theta activity described above is consistent with a Ciganek
rhythm and is a normal variant.
