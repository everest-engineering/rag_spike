DATE OF RECORDING:  12/28/2012.
LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system, additional T1 and T2 electrodes and single EKG lead.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old man postoperative day #7 after surgery for aortic arch dilatation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, drug abuse, COPD, DVT.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include heparin, labetalol, fentanyl.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 12 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is unstable.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta activity is present.  Excess beta activity is noted as well.  No clear sleep is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage to sleep.
IMPRESSIONS:
This is an abnormal 23-minute electroencephalogram due to mild diffuse slowing and disorganization.  These findings indicate etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, this case could partially be related to the medication effect.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
When compared to the EEG from 12/20/2012, this EEG demonstrates mild degree of encephalopathy.
