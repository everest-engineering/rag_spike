CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old male with sleep disturbance and rash, nocturnal hallucinations, sleep walking and involuntary movements in sleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydroxyzine, Simvastatin, Verapamil, Prilosec, HCTZ, Zocor, Atarax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is a bit slow and disorganized for an adult of this age with the alpha rhythm typically just under 8 Hz.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in rhythmicity of the background.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there are occasional bursts of shifting slowing. Photic stimulation elicits limited bilateral driving.
HR:    85 bpm and occasionally irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A somewhat slow alpha rhythm.
In wakefulness there were occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Prolonged sleep was not obtained.  In fact limited sleep was obtained.  An overnight polysomnogram may be appropriate to characterize his nocturnal events.
