CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old male who developed abrupt onset left-sided numbness and weakness after smoking K2.  History of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, aspirin, Zofran.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.  This is a technically acceptable record with impedances generally under 5 kilohms.  Sleep was not achieved.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta.  Alpha squeak was noted as were lateral rectus eye movements.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
