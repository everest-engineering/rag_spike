History:	55 year old man who is in coma.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background is completely burst suppressed with no
discernable cerebral activity detected.  Continues low amplitude EMG artifact is present in the
anterior leads.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, marked
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable EEG due to complete burst suppression and lack of background
reactivity. These findings are indicative of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  This EEG was NOT performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the
determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
