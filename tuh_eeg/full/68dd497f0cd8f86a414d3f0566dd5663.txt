History: 21 year old status post a MVA with resultant left carotid artery dissection, undergoing stent placement.
Medications: fentanyl, versed, Vecuronium
Sedation:
EEG Type: Extended, 40-60 min, portable
Technique: international 10.20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
DESCRIPTION:
There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient early in the recording the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic diffuse theta and delta activity admixed with bursts of high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant rhythmic delta (FIRDA). After administration of additional doses of fentanyl and versed at-12:49 pm. there is a change In the background characterized by diffuse decrease in the background amplitude, disappearance of theta activity. More prominent delta activity and appears of under riding fast activity that, at times, resembles sleep spindles. The carotid stent Is deployed at ~1:10pm. There is no change in the background after the carotid stent is deployed No normal sleep architecture is present.
Additional polymorphic higher amplitude theta and delta activity Is noted over the left hemisphere. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed. Impedances are high and 01 and 02 electrodes are positioned dose to T5 and T6 electrodes, respectively, due to the position of the patient and the conditions of the recording.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left hemispheric
Other, There is no change in the background after the carotid stent deployed.
This is an ABNORMAL 47 minute continuous interpretive EEG monitoring due to baseline left hemispheric slowing. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. No change In the background was observed after the carotid stent was deployed.
