CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old woman with staring spell at 15-20 minutes followed by confusion and drowsiness.

MEDICATIONS:  Previously treated with Depakote, Topamax, Zonisamide, now none listed

Previous seizure on the 14th.

INTRODUCTION:  Greater than 20 minute digital EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were acceptable aside from T1-T2 electrodes.  There was a fair amount of muscle noted in the background.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized.  There are some unusual sharp waves noted in the background including the left hemisphere with a somewhat unusual field of spread into the mid to posterior temporal regions.  Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with eye movement and then additional faster frequency activity.  Lambda was noted in apparent wakefulness, but there also appears to be an underlying sharp wave in the occipital region, maximum at 01.  As the patient becomes drowsy, this discharge is a bit more prominent.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  Following photic stimulation, occipital sharp waves appear, typically with an 01 maximum.

Heart rate:  66 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background.
2. Left occipital sharp waves, at times becoming somewhat periodic in sleep.
3. Some additional epileptiform discharges with more of a mid to posterior temporal localization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG seems to demonstrate more epileptiform activity than noted in the 1st study.  No clinical seizures were noted.
