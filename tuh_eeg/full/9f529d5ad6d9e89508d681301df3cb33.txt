CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 48-year-old male admitted with an episode of staring, history of staring and shaking, previously treated with Keppra.  History of stroke with right-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dapsone, Ativan, Serax, Truvada, Protonix, Remeron, oxazepam, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with an 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  The background includes generous theta and generous frontal beta.  Intermittent paroxysmal rhythmic bursts are noted as the patient transitions into deeper stages of sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Excess theta.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific.  They may be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy with the use of sedative hypnotic medications, or following ingestion of similar compounds.  No epileptiform features were noted.  This patient's 3 previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
