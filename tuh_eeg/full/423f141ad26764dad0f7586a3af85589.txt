History:	86 YR FEMALE WITH CC LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT
HEMISPHERIC STROKE DUE TO RIGHT ICA OCCLUSION. THIS AM PATIENT
HAD A GTC SZ X2 MIN.
Medications:	ATIVAN THIS AM, KEPPRA LOADED, ACETAMINOPHEN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence
of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Intrahemispheric asymmetry was seen
with a mixed-frequency, lower voltage pattern over the right hemisphere and a slower, more
rhythmic and higher voltage pattern over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture was
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left more than right bifrontal regions.
At times, this becomes more rhythmic in the left frontal region.  One T3 sharp wave was seen.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, one, left temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (L>R)
Focal slowing, rhythmic, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing which is indicative of moderate
to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific. In addition, there was
rhythmic, nearly continuous focal slowing in the left greater than right frontal regions.  This finding
is concerning for an underlying structural lesion.  The single, left temporal sharp wave seen could
indicate a region of focal cortical irritability.
