History:	39 YR FEMALE WITH STRONG PSYCH HISTORY AND SEVERAL EPISODES OF
CONCUSSIONS WITH ABN MM OF UE'S AND BUCKLING OF LEGS ASSOC WITH
HEAD TRAUMA FALLING.  DEPRESSION, BIPOLAR, ANXIETY, ADD, HTN,
Medications:	SEROQUEL, LITHIUM, SPIRIVA, XANAX, LAMICTAL, ABILIFY, NEURONTIN,
(LIPITOR, SEROQUEL, Lithium, Spiriva, xanax, lamictal, abilify, neurontin, lipitor,
SYNTHROID, ULTRAM, BACLOFEN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely, but
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta
activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
No focal slowing is present.  Single left frontotemporal sharp transient of unclear significance.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 11 to 13 fps.  HR = 78
Summary of Findings:
Sharp transients, single, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, and drowsy. Please note that there was a single sharp transient of
unclear significance but concerning for an epileptogenic discharge. Would recommend a repeat
EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep.
