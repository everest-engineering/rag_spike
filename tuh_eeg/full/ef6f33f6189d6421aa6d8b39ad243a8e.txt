CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 24-year-old woman with epilepsy, recent increase in seizures, complex neurological and general medical history.
MEDICATIONS:  Lacosamide, Lamictal, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall background EEG is somewhat poorly organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 hertz and excess background theta.  The overall background is relatively sharply contoured.
In a sharply contoured background, occasional left temporal sharp waves were noted in wakefulness.  The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles.  She is falling asleep during hyperventilation.  Other features of stage 2 sleep include POSTS.  Epileptiform activity seems to abate in stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and seems to increase the background theta.  There is a more subtle sharp waves noted on the right in hyperventilation and the patient transitioned to stage 2 sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep and did not activate the record.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal routine outpatient EEG due to:
Significant background slowing and disorganization.
In this sharply contoured record, left temporal sharp waves were noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult.  Previous EEG patterns have been quite variable demonstrating right or left temporal features as well as generalized epileptiform discharges.  The discharges today are primarily temporal.  No seizures were recorded.
