CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old right handed male with impaired memory, short term memory loss. Rapidly progressive cognitive decline with ribbon-like restrictive diffusion on the MRI.
MEDICATIONS: Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a rhythmic theta frequency pattern. There is an asymmetry in that the theta is somewhat slower on the left when compared to the right typically 6.5 to 7.5 on the left and 7.5 closer to 8 on the right. Wicket activity is identified. There is some eye blink artifact and rare, simple, left mid temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic slowing. As the patient transitions out of drowsiness, there is a more clear asymmetry with focal slowing in the left hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left compared to the right. Photic stimulation produces a driving response on the right but not on the left.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing.
2. Superimposed intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower activity on the left compared to the right and disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and while matter. None of the characteristic features of Jakob-Creutzfeldt were seen, although there were a handful of simple sharp waves. A followup study in 1 month may be helpful.
