CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, increased ICP, recent barbiturate coma.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Propofol, Zofran, Vancomycin, Zosyn

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. From the best Information that can be determined, the patient has not been in barbiturate coma since last week.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a burst suppression pattern with bursts of faster frequency activity, bursts of theta frequency activity, and an amplitude asymmetry sometimes higher amplitude on the right compared to the left Tactile stimulation of the patient does not particularly change the record. Average duration of suppressions is 1-3 seconds and average duration of cerebral activity tends to be around 3 seconds. The overall pattern is not completely flat. Rare sharp waves are observed. The physical examination demonstrates an intubated comatose patient and it is not possible to determine if the patient has eye deviation during the EEG.

HR: 75 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Discontinuous bursts suppression pattern.
2. Low voltage pattern.
3. Rare sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: If in fact the patient is receiving sedative hypnotic doses of propofol, then that would certainly account for the burst suppression pattern obtained.
