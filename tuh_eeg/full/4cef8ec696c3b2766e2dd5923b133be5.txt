CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed woman with childhood epilepsy, bipolar disease, and depression.  Seizure free until July 2011 with a tonic clonic seizure with incontinence and confusion.  Recurrent seizure September 10, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Ambien, Atarax, Depakote, Zoloft
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak was noted.  Posterior slow waves of youth were apparent.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background beta, as well as POSTS. Hyperventilation produces scant increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient was transitioning into stage II sleep, but does elicit a driving response.
HR:    54 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG and wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  There were no previous EEGs for this patient.  If additional information is needed to characterize this patient's epilepsy, a more prolonged EEG may be considered.
