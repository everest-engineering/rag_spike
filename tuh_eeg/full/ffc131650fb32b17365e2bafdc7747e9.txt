History:	70 YO WOMAN WITH EPISODES OF IMPAIRED SPEECH, FAINTING AND RIGHT
EYE VISION LOSS. HIGH GRADE LEFT CAROTID STENOSIS. PRE-OP L CEA.
PMHX: THYROID, HTN, DM, ASTHMA
Medications:	Gabapentin, Plavix, Levothyroxine, Clonazepam, Clonidine, Losartan.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions. At times pronounced at CZ.  During drowsiness, the background slows to
central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
60. Frequent left temporalis artifact.  At time a Cz ciganek-like rhythm is seen.
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
