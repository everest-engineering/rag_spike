History:	31 year old man with a history of seizures, now presents with increase in his seizure-
frequency.
Medications:	Dilantin, phenobarbital and Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
During drowsiness, patient has 2 brief (~4.5 seconds each) runs consisting of rhythmic right anterior
temporal delta activity and 1-2 Hz low amplitude right anterior temporal sharp waves (maximal
scalp negativity occurs over T2 lead).
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, right temporal, anterior, 2 brief runs of rhythmic sharps
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), right temporal, anterior, during drowsiness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG due to 2 brief (~4.5 seconds) runs of right
anterior rhythmic delta activity with embedded 1-2 Hz low amplitude epileptiform discharges. These
findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the right anterior
temporal region.
