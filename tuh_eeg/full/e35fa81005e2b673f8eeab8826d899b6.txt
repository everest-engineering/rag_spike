CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed woman with recent stroke and episode of right hemiparesis which preceded 2 episodes of confusion and agitation.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Prozac
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1o-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there Is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm in a background of generous theta. There is occasional, rhythmic theta in the left mid temporal region. These are typically brief bursts. On 1 occasion, it is somewhat sharply contoured in the left temporal region. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in beta. The rhythmic activity on the left is actually 4 Hz in nature. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Rhythmic, sharply contoured theta in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This finding can be seen in the context of cerebrovascular disease. It is also observed in localization-related epilepsy. There were no other significant sharp waves noted.
