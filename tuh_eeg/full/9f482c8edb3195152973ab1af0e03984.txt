History:	47 YR OLD MALE R HANDED. PRESENTED TO ED WITH HEADACHE AND
REPORT OF NEW LOSS OF R VISUAL FIELD. PT.SUFFERED FROM OCCIPITAL
CVA APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 6 DAYS AGO.MRI SHOWED 3 DAY OLD INFARCT
C/W WITH HIS HISTORY.
Medications:	ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. At times it appears to be intermittently disrupted on the left.
Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
