CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old right-handed woman with childhood epilepsy at age 8.  The patient outgrew epilepsy, but seizures recurred in 2011 and recent tonic-clonic seizure after she ran out of medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Flexeril, albuterol, and Keppra (patient ran out).
INTRODUCTION:  20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall background in wakefulness is at the limits of normal with a small amount of background theta.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record and clearly accentuate rhythmic paroxysmal theta followed by high amplitude, frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity with most bursts lasting less than 3 seconds.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient became drowsy, again bursts of frontally predominant spike and wave activity were noted.  Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.  Spike and wave activity was seen in between the photic stimuli, but was not associated with the photic stimuli, did not overlap at that time of stimulation.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and drowsy due to
Bursts of frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity of less than 5 seconds duration.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is supportive of a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  The abundant epileptiform activity may be due to the absence of pharmacotherapy at this time for this adult.
