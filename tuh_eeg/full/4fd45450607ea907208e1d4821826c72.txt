CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old male, unknown handedness with headaches. Snoring.
He had an episode where he was unarousable. EMS gave Narcan for pinpoint pupils and then Ativan, Nicardipine and Keppra. The patient was found to have a very large pontine hemorrhage status post ventriculostomy.
MEDICATIONS: Versed, Vecuronium, Morphine, Cardene
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated with the frontal ventriculostomy as described above.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG resembles a drowsy or sedated pattern. There are a handful of vertex waves, generous beta. There is variability noted in the record. Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity. As the recording continues, there are additional waveforms suggestive of a stage II sleep pattern with spindles and vertex waves. There are a handful of shifting asymmetries with a bit more beta seen on the left or the right or seen on the left more than the right or asynchronous spindles.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Asymmetric sleep morphology.
2. Slow background
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG recording on the morning of the 7th, supports a favorable prognosis although these findings should be tempered by the actual clinical scenario. The EEG demonstrates intact thalamic cortical function as well as reactivity.
Ongoing clinical vigilance is advised.
