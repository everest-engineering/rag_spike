CLINICAL HISTORY: A 24-year-old male transferred from an outside hospital with recurrent nonepileptic seizures, some of which are brief, others which are prolonged.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Effexor, Propranolol, Strattera.
OTHER:  History of recurrent, nonepileptic seizures, bipolar disease, depression.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient had multiple events.  He received an injection of normal saline.  The patient was able to push the button for all events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.  Sleep is relatively disrupted.
Patient interacts with the nurse at 4 a.m. and then is awake for some time afterwards.
INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES:  None.
EVENTS:  The patient has multiple behavioral events.  He is able to push the button for the events including 6:15 p.m., 6:25 p.m. and nurse pushes the button again for the 6:25 p.m. event and 11:07 p.m.  Also, 9:06 a.m. on May 31.  There are 2 practice push button events as well.  During all of these push button events, the patient has behaviors that are characteristic of a nonepileptic seizure with head bobbing, head moving from side-to-side.  He is verbally and behaviorally unresponsive with a normal awake alpha rhythm.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 24 hour video electroencephalogram monitoring session was remarkable for:
Multiple behavioral events without electroencephalogram change.
A normal awake and asleep electroencephalogram.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the EEG.  Although previous records are not available, by report, these findings are similar to a previous long term EEG monitoring session.
