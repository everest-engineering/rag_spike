CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old gentleman with morbid obesity and left MCA
thrombosis.
MEDICATIONS: labetalol,lovenox, Lipitor, Coumadin, Pantoprazole, Hydralazine,
Gentamicin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated in the
ICU.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a relatively low voltage suppressed
pattern on the left The right has a great deal of sweat artifact, but there is a bit more
very low voltage theta pattern with intermittent delta. Stimulation of the patient
produces a bit more cerebral activity from the right hemisphere, not so much from the
left. Occasional movements are noted of the left side of the body .
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. An asymmetry with slower activity on the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Sweat artifact confounds the data, but overall this is a
markedly abnormal and slow record. There were no epileptiform features.
