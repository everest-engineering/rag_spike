DATE OF STUDY: 08/28/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient EEG TYPE: 95819 Routine
EEG #: 15-1251
HISTORY:
63 y.o. female referred for routine EEG for worsening seizures: ONSET AGE 12. 1-2 sz MONTH. ONSET FEELS
NERVOUS, ANXIOUS/ LOC/ GTC/ URINARY INCONT. POST SAYS FEELS FINE. PRIMARY WANTED PT TO TAKE DILANTIN BUT PHARMACY WOULD NOT FILL
IT.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
phenytoin (DILANTIN) 100 mg/4 mL suspension, Take by mouth 2 times daily. Not taking.
Keppra Naprosyn
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: none TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Intermittent bursts of left temporal focal slow, some with medium amplitude left temporal sharp waves were seen.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen. The left temporal focal slowing becomes more prominent.
Subtle generalized slowing is present. There is a small amount of excess theta in the central regions
LEFT temporal Focal slowing is present. It is characterized by bursts of mixed theta/delta, seen in wakefulness, accentuated by
activity seen in some of these bursts.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
Intermittent, somewhat irregular left temporal sharp waves, primarily in early drowsiness.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: accentuates underlying theta activity Photic Stimulation: Driving response present, R>L.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal awake-and-asleep routine EEG: Left temporal sharp waves
Left temporal focal slowing CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an sharp waves epilepsy.
Abnormal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG. Left temporal Support the diagnosis of localization related
