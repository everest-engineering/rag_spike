CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed woman with Alzheimer's disease,
stroke, liver failure, and metastatic melanoma, status post resection of left. temporal and
right parietal metastasis.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Decadron, Dexamethasone, Lovenox, Pantoprazole, ASA,
Plavix, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized with a
mixture of theta and prominent shifting arrhythmic delta. The overall background is
quite sharply contoured. Despite the prior craniotomy there are a handful left anterior
and right posterior temporal sharp waves.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity from either hemisphere.
3. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
4. Right posterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The arrhythmic delta activity may be correlated with this
patient's bihemispheric white matter pathology. The sharp waves are in the region of
her 2 previous resections. The background slowing may be related to the metastasis,
toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, or other neurologic pathologies.
