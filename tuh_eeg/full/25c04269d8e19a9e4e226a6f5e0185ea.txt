CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old woman with a history of stroke, seizures, subarachnoid hemorrhage, right temporal hematoma. Very anxious, the patient had difficulty providing history, additional history was not available.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Gentamicin, Metoprolol, Famotidine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a hard collar and is ventilated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This challenging, bedside, portable EEG demonstrates generous beta and muscle artifact. Head rocking artifact is noted. During the course of the EEG, the patient develops a temp of 102. 1, which also compromises electrode quality. Stimulation of the patient by putting an arterial line produces a brief attenuation.

HR: 104 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with generous beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features noted, however these findings could be missed due to the clinical described above. If epilepsy or seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study when the patient is afebrile and out of the hard collar is suggested.
