CLINICAL HISTORY:
A 45-year-old with hypertension, stroke, and anxiety. The patient awoke with a
confusional spells, shaking, eyes rolling back, and incontinence. Previous similar spells In the past 8 months.
MEDICATIONS: Percocet Neurontin, Plavix, percocet others.
INTRODUCTION
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.
This is an awake through stage II sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD
The overall EEG is low voltage, but there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally. The patient Is quite drowsy, and much of the record Includes a low voltage sleep pattern. Vertex waves were noted. Eye movements are noted to persist into the sleep pattern. In sleep, there are occasional bursts of shifting slowing to the right or left of the midline. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Occasional shifting slowing in the central temporal regions in drowsiness and sleep. No definitive epileptiform discharges Were noted. The shifting slowing noted is a nonspecific finding but can be seen in the context of underlying cerebrovascular disease. A low voltage pattern Is not specifically pathological for an adult of this age. but is remarkable given this patient's youth.
