CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old male with a history of pulmonary contusion, new
onset seizures, COPD, vent dependent respiratory failure, neurologic consult requested
for embolic stroke and seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Diltiazem, Lexapro, Prednisone, Allopurinol, Spironolactone,
Lexapro, Pravachol, Prednisone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and
hyperventilation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
slow and disorganized with a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is 15 arrhythmic
delta activity. Initially some of this is more remarkable on the right. As the patient
becomes drowsy there is arrhythmic delta activity, a little slower on the right with a
handful of sharp waves on the left. Features of sleep include: Stage I sleep includes
vertex waves. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 66 bpm and irregular
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background disorganization and mild slow for age.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity right greater than left.
3. A few left sharp waves.
CLINICAL This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for
epilepsy. The focal sign however is more remarkable on the right with sharp waves on
the left. Correlation with imaging in previous studies is advised.
