REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, phenobarbital, Vimpat, Versed and during the last hours, propofol.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours from 8/24/2013 until 8/25/2013 using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with atrial and anterolateral temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while intubated and sedated.  Activating and posteriors were not performed.
CLINICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old man with history of left parietal tumor resection and radiation, who presents with recurrent seizures and small intraparenchymal hemorrhages.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record at onset has diffusely slow pattern with no normal posterior dominant rhythm.  There is an excessive amount of frontal beta that comes and goes throughout the recording.  Again, the background basically consists of delta slowing in 2-4 hertz, seen continuously.  There is no clear burst suppression noted.  At around 2 o'clock p.m. propofol was started.  And by 4 p.m, the EEG started changing and the background started having intermittent suppression with bursts occurring maybe every once every 3-5 seconds.  As the medication was increased, these bursts became more spread apart and they would occur every ten seconds.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves, 2-4 hertz between 20 - 60 microvolts. Now on burst suppression.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slow waves within the last 18 hours, burst suppression pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology but most likely in this case, is due to medication effect.  No seizures have been seen in the past 24 hours.
