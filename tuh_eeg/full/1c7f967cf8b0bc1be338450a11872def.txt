History:	25 year old female cc memory loss s/p code 6/29 x6 min. 3 wks post partum.  no
recollect of event from new baby to now. also pt not remembering visitors etc. also
decrease strength in le.  pmhx:  graves, code. chf, shock liver, rll pneum, post
partum 3 wks
Medications:	No significant meds
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  There is a short sleep latency
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, slow
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL mainly sleep EEG because of mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm
which is non-specific with regards to etiology. In addition the record is mainly in sleep and there is
a short  sleep latency which may suggest a sleep disorder. Further evaluation with a sleep study
may be beneficial if clinically indicated.
