CLINICAL HISTORY:  Prior CVA, recent status epilepticus
MEDICATIONS:  Versed and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  During the record, the patient was receiving a dose of Versed at 14 mg which was decreased at midnight, the morning of February 3rd and turned off.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a markedly slow and suppressed pattern.  The activity from both hemispheres is relatively featureless but the left hemisphere demonstrates a sharp wave, typically maximum in the left mid temporal region.  The sharp wave is fading, seen every 3 seconds or even in some sections of the record is not present.
After the Versed the drip is decreased, the background from the right hemisphere transitions to a lower voltage theta pattern.  The sharp waves in the left are a little bit more defined at the end of the 24 hour recording but no seizures were noted.
Heart rate 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
No seizures.
Decrease in periodic activity.
With elimination of the Versed, a more vigorous pattern from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Additional recording will be employed as the patient's medications are titrated downward.
