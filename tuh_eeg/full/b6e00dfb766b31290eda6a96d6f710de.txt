History:	57 year old male in coma with diffuse twitching following cardiac arrest.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours.  Nursing-initiated event buttons were
correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the
bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is essentially no meaningful cerebral activity recorded.  There are rare intermittent 1-2
second bursts of delta activity seen.  There is muscle artifact seen without clinical correlate.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal abnormalities.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  Muscle twitching is not observed.
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern, rare, bilateral diffuse
Attenuation, continuous, severe, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a markedly ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG due to complete attenuation of the background
and a rare burst-suppression pattern. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Burst-suppression pattern carries a grave prognosis for
neurological recovery.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
