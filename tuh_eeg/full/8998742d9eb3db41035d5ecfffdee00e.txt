History:	42 yo female nocturnal sz since May 2014 (4 sz in total) . +generalized shaking, +
tongue bite, + urinary incont. post-ictal confusion. duration of events unknown. last
SZ dec 6th. pmh: recent pulmonary edema, HTN
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the right
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
