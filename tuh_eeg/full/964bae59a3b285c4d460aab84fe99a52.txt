History:	78 YEAR OLD MALE EVALUATED FOR SEIZURES. HX OF DIABETES,
HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERLIPIDEMIA
Medications:	GLUCOTROL, LEVOTHROID, FORTAMET, ASPIRIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Rare focal spike-and-wave discharges are present in the left
frontocentral region (F3/C3) during sleep.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, rare, left other, C3/F3
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of rare epileptiform discharges in
the left frontocentral region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
