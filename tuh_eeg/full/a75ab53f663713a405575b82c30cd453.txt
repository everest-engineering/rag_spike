CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old left handed male with post traumatic epilepsy, head
trauma 20 years ago. The patient was seizure-free for 20 years until April 3rd, when he
had a seizure with loss of consciousness, incontinence and confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is
somewhat slow and slightly disorganized. The alpha rhythm is 8 Hz, 30 microvolts with
excess frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces head rocking artifact as
well as some rhythmic slowing. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
background slowing. Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
I. Mild background slowing.
2. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The background
slowing described above is a nonspecific finding, supporting a diffuse, bihemispheric
disturbance of cerebral function. To more. completely characterize this individual's
epilepsy, a followup study may be of value.
