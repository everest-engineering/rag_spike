CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old woman with syncope at the Alzheimer Center and Alzheimer's.

MEDICATIONS: Risperdal, Imdur, ASA, Lovastatin, Glipizide, Lisinopril, Isosorbide

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 7.8 Hz. There is occasional shifting arrhythmic delta activity, left greater than right, and occasional FIRDA. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, in Alzheimer disease or in multi-infarct dementia. No epileptiform features were noted.
