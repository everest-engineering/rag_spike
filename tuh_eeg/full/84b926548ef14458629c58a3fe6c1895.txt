CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 75-year-old woman with declining memory, personality changes, syncopal events, and visual hallucinations of cats.  Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, lactulose, and lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with most impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9.5 Hz, with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by rhythmic central theta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved and the patient transitioned in and out of wakefulness and sleep.  In that transition, on occasion, a Mu activity was noted.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Stage 2 sleep was not captured.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
