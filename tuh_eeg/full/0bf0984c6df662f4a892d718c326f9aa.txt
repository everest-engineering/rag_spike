CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old right handed woman with tonic clonic seizures, last seizure 3 months ago. Seizures are characterized by incontinence and postictal confusion. Past history: Depression, possible dementia.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Klonopin, Zyprexa, Advair
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized. There is prominent 3-4 Hz activity on the left. The right hemisphere has more of a predominance of 4-5 Hz activity, but some of the same 2-3 Hz activity noted on the left. There is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. Brief drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in eye movements and increase in rhythmicity of the background. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response although there is a fair amount of artifact noted in the background.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry with slower activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted. The pattern described above is a nonspecific pattern and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance due
to many different causes. Consideration for a diffuse disturbance and/or a focal process is appropriate in that the left is a bit slower.
