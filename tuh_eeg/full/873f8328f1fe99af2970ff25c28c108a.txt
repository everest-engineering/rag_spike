History:	51 YR FEMALE WHO HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING DIZZINESS SINCE SEPT.
EPISODES USUALLY LAST SEVERAL MINUTES BUT SOMETIMES WILL GO ON
FOR AN 1HR.  PT STATES DOES NOT HAPPEN EVERY DAY.  CT SHOWED 3 CM
CYST IN LEFT TEMPORAL.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 13Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess Beta activity present.  Sleep not captured.
No focal slowing is present.  Some sharply contoured temporal activity was seen.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Pt
did complain of feeling dizzy during this procedure. No EEG changes during this time.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at flash rates
from 15 to 21 fps.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
