History:	66 YR FEMALE S/P COIL LEFT OPTHALMIC ANEURYSM,  ADM ICH WITH IVH
FOUND ANEURYSM.  EVD RIGHT FRONTAL.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the
right midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Brief increase of activity to 7Hz after
nasal stimulation.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, left temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of nearly continuous focal slowing in the left midtemporal
region This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. Lastly there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
