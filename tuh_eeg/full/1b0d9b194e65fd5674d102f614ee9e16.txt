History:	56 YR MALE FOUND UNRESP WITH UE TREMORS WITH  8-11 EPISODES OF SEIZURE LIKE ACTIVITY.  TRANS FROM ROX.  PMHX: HYPOTHYROID, GOUT, PSYCHOSIS, GERD, MUSCLE SPASM, MIGRAINES, ANXIETY.
Medications:	FOSPHENYTOIN, DILANTIN, VERSED, RECD OUTSIDE HOSP.  (HOME MED
KLONOPIN), ATIVAN GIVEN DURING THE  STUDY.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  No normal sleep architecture Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the bilateral frontotemporal regions.  This pattern does not appear to evolve and at time seems to stop and then restart. No change with stimulation. Ativan 2mg was administered with no change in the background.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Excessive fast
Focal slowing, rhythmic, continuous, bilateral frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous semi-rhythmic focal slowing in the bilateral frontotemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.  Even thought the pattern is monomorphic it does not appear to evolve and therefore unlikely epileptic. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Findings were communicated to the primary team.
