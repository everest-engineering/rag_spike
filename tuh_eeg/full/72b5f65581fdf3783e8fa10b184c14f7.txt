DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is brief wakefulness with a well defined 11 Hz alpha rhythm, but the majority of the record includes drowsiness with generous background theta. Motor activity, including tremor, produces 4-5 Hz artifact. Photic stimulation is remarkable for tremulousness.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The excess beta described above may be associated with this patient's medications.
