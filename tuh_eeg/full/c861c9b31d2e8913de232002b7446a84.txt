History:	84 year old man with a history of bilateral SDH, now presents with episodes of
confusion, falls; concerning for seizures.
Medications:	No AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8-8.5 Hz and expected AP gradient
is present.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta activity is present.  During sleep, the background is
characterized by a mixture of moderate voltage theta and delta activity.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 22 minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
