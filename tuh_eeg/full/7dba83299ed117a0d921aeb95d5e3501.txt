History:	29 year old man with a history of GSW with subsequent seizures.  No reported
seizures since 2006 and off AEDs till his recent seizure.
Medications:	none
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Continuous polymorphic sharply countoured theta and delta activity is present over the right
midtemporal region.  Additional underriding fast activity is seen over the right anterior-
midtemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and accentuates focal slowing
in the right midtemporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid, mild-to-moderate
Breach artifact, right temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 26-minute EEG due to continuous focal slowing in the
right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
Breach artifact is secondary to the skull defect.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
