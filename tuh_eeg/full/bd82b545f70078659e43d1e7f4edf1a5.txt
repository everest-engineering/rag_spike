CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old male with developmental delay, hypertension, and heart failure, who was found unresponsive, slumping to the left with eye deviation.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Ativan, Lexapro, ASA, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is uncooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is somnolent but with stimulation he arouses.  There is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is more easily identified on the left compared to the right.  The overall amplitude is relatively low voltage, and there is a bit more theta in the right posterior quadrant.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in stage II sleep.  Stage II sleep is relatively symmetric.  As the patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep, there are some shifting asymmetries in the posterior region.
HR:    96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An excessively drowsy patient.
Shifting slowing, particularly in the posterior region with disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The shifting features identified primarily in wakefulness or the transition to sleep are nonspecific and can be seen with a structural or functional disturbance.
