CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old man status post PEA code for 15 minutes, found down for some unknown period of time.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Zosyn, Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Midazolam, Fentanyl, Versed.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post PEA code, found down.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely suppressed background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontocentral beta.  Intermixed with this diffuse attenuation, there are bursts of at times frontally predominant spike discharge followed by muscle artifact.  At times this frontally predominant spike is not seen but there is slowing and muscle artifact.  Clinically, the patient appears to open his eyes during these burst that last as long as 2 seconds and appears to tremble slightly.  The patient is suctioned during the study and there is no change in the pattern in the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Diffuse suppression.
Bursts of anterior predominant spike and slow wave discharge followed by slow waves and muscle artifact along with associated clinical response of eye opening and trembling consistent with myoclonus.
SEIZURES:  See above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized suppression and generalized spike and wave discharges consistent with myoclonus.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with the known hypoxic injury.  The marked suppression pattern along with the myoclonus is suggestive of a poor prognosis.
