CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed male with intractable seizures, MR, hypertension, either hydrocephalus or hypoencephalitis (?), seizure-free for the last year.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow with excess theta and, at times, a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha but typically the alpha rhythm is slower than this. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features were observed. If additional information is needed to characterize this epilepsy, a follow up study deeper stages of sleep may be needed.
