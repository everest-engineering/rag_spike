History:	53 year old man with a history of a prior left MCA stroke, now presents with
confusion and worsening right arm weakness.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
There is continuous subtle right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms and mild
voltage attenuation over the left.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of moderate
amplitude 9.5-10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with expected AP gradient.  The background over
the left hemisphere consists of low amplitude polymorphic 9-10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with
weak AP gradient, underriding low amplitude delta activity and general paucity of faster
frequencies.  Symmetric sleep spindles, vertex waves and K-complexes are captured.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left hemispheric, especially over the temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable awake and asleep 23-minute EEG due to continuous mild left
hemispheric focal slowing and voltage attenuation. These finding are indicative of a focal
structural lesion over the left and are consistent with a history of a prior left MCA stroke.
