CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old male, who suffered a seizure April 23rd in the context of work stress.  Son has seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory record for a patient with braids.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm and brief stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
