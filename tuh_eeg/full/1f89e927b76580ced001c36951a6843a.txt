CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 13, seizure-free aside when patient runs out of medicine at which time, she has had seizures with loss of consciousness for 20-25 minutes, not otherwise described.  Mother and sister also suffer from epilepsy.  The patient also suffers from depression, fibromyalgia, lumbar radiculopathy, L4 discectomy, dyspepsia.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Detrol, Cymbalta, Flexeril, Abilify, Buspar, Restoril, Lyrica, Flexeril, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage with generous beta.  The posterior dominant rhythm appears to be 15 Hz.  There is excess frontal rhythmic theta noted in wakefulness.  Drowsiness is characterized by dropout of the posterior dominant rhythm and an increase in rhythmic theta delta.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and seems to accentuate both the beta and the theta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for excess frontal theta.
Clinical Correlation:  No epileptiform features were noted in this record.  The background slowing described above is a nonspecific pattern, but may be associated with this patient's pharmacotherapy.  If additional information is needed about her epilepsy, a more prolonged study is suggested.
