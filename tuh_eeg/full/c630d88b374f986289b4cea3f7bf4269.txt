History:	50 YR FEMALE WITH H/O SZS. 4-5  A MONTH. GTC/LOC/POST CONFUSION,
ALSO STARING SZS.  PT WAS PREMI BORN AT HOME. PMHX: SZ, MODERATE
Medications:	LAMICTAL, VIMPAT, LEXAPRO, LYRICA, GEODON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Bursts of bilaterally asynchronous independent sharp waves occur
over the bitemporal region, with a repetition rate of 2-3 Hz, most pronounced on the left side
(maximal at F7/T3), lasting up to 7 seconds  with no evolution or behavioral changes during this
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal
Sharp waves, bilateral (L>R) temporal, independently
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.  Frequent independent bitemporal epileptiform discharges  are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic focus in this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent
with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with multiple foci.
