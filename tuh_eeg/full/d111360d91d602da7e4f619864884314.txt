CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old right handed man with a history of intracranial hemorrhage status post motor vehicle accident in November 2011; reported seizures in January 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Norvasc, Iron, Lisinopril, Multivitamins, Colace, Senna, Lopressor, Zocor.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient has normal beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Continuous focal slowing seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves in the left frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontotemporal region, which is consistent with the known lesion n that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
