History:	38 year old man with extensive psychiatric history, now with episodes concerning for
seizures.
Medications:	HYDROXYZINE,LAMICTAL,HALOPERIDOL,BENZTROPINE,DIPHENHYDRAMINE,
FAMOTIDINE, CLOZAPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 102.  Persistent eye blinking artifact is present throughout
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 27-minute awake-only EEG.   No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. There is a persistent blink artifact throughout the recording, so subtle
anterior slowing might have been missed.
