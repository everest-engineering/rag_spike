CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old male with complex neurologic history, Including severe intracranial stenosis and left endarterectomy, status post hemicraniectomy for massive stroke, now with left eye rhythmic blinking and left mild twitching.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Morphine, Isoflurane, Sevoflurane, Propofol, Versed, Rocuronium, Lidocaine, Fentanyl, Neosynephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dramatic intrahemispheric asymmetry. The activity from the left is essentially suppressed. The right hemisphere demonstrates primarily a theta frequency pattern. There is some assault and a significant EKG artifact, but no sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity on the right. There are rare bursts of broad, sharply contoured delta from the right. There is intermittent delta on the right, in addition to the primarily theta frequency activity. Arousals are noted with an increase in alpha theta on the right.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked intrahemispheric asymmetry.
2. A moderately slow pattern on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted. No seizures were recorded. It is not clear if the patient's facial twitching did occur during the EEG.
