History:	53 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ DISORDER SINCE TEENS, PT
REPORTS SZ FREE FOR THE PAST 5 YRS, OFF ALL MEDS.
Medications:	No AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Rare polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Rare focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F7/T3.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  EKG 70
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, rare, left temporal, anterior
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of rare epileptiform discharges in
the left anterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus
in this region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
