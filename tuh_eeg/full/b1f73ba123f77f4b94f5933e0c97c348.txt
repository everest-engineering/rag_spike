History:	32 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O HEADACHES/MIGRAINES FOR THE
PAST 5 YRS, NOW WITH C/C OF INCREASE  / 3 X A WEEK MAINLY FRONTAL
W/DULL TO SHARP NATURE AND NAUSEA
Medications:	TOPAMAX, MEDROL, ALBUTEROL, SINGULAR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces minimal effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces minimal photic driving
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22 minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A normal EEG does not rule out the
clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  A repeat tracing for more prolonged periods may be helpful.
