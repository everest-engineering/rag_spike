CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed woman with seizure versus
nonepileptic seizures characterized by an aura of lightheadedness, generalized shaking
with loss of consciousness. History of pseudotumor cerebri.
Topamax, Diamox, Klonopin, Prozac, Seroquel, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral
driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is a
strong consideration, a repeat tracing captured in sleep is suggested.
