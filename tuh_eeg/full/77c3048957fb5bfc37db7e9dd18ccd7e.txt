History:	83 YR FEMALE WITH ACUTE ONSET RIGHT SIDE NUMBNESS. CT LEFT FRONTAL HEMOR.
Medications:	KEPPRA,  PRN MORPHINE, OXY (PER NURSE HASN'T RECD TODAY)
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal (left more than right) region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are seen
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific
