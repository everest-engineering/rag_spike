CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old gentleman with intermittent lightheadedness and gait difficulty.  PTSD following head injury in the military 10 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, hydrochlorothiazide, and buspirone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.  It is technically satisfactory with most impedances below 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, but with a well-defined 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Hyperventilation increase the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
