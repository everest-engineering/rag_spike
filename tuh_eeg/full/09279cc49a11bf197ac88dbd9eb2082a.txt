CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed female with a history of GERD, hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, right hip replacement, and change in mental status with a left medial temporal lesion of unclear etiology.
MEDICATIONS: Nebivolol, Valsartan, Potassium, Atorvastatin, Dexlansoprazole.
REASON FOR STUDY: Recent change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes. The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz with a normal amount of frontocentral beta. Wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II, are recorded. Activation procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves seen at T3, occasionally at 2 to 4Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts. Please note that at times these slow waves in the left temporal region appear sharply contoured; however, never clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent left temporal slow waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION : This EEG reveals evidence of left midtemporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
