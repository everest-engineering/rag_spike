CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84-year-old woman with involuntary movements of the left arm and hand, worsened by pressing on the left shoulder and left cervical radiculopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Plavix, Protonix, and Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  A 30-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  During the EEG, the patient had her typical symptoms of a circular movements of the left arm.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Intermittent episodes of left arm jerking were associated with artifact.  The duration of the left arm or hand circular movements ranges from 30 seconds to 90 seconds.  The patient remains awake and alert.  The jerking is associated with single channel artifact in the left occipital region, but the EEG is otherwise normal.
Towards the close of the record, the patient becomes drowsy with brief stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, and brief spindles was noted in stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this individual with involuntary movements of the left hand.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No EEG signature was associated with these involuntary movements.  In addition, the patient was awake and alert throughout.
