REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old man with history of change in mental status and sudden onset of aphasia, concern for stroke. Past medical history significant for prostate cancer on chemo, mets to bone and lymph nodes,  depression, hypertension, and reflux.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, Zosyn, Lovenox, Protonix, mirtazapine, Avelox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous eye movement artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen independently and occasionally more on the left at F7/T3 more than F8/T4 seen occasionally throughout the recording at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Mild generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz in wakefulness.
Heart rate:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent, left more than right, bilateral anterior temporal slowing, in addition to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left more than right anterior temporal region, in addition to mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, all of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
