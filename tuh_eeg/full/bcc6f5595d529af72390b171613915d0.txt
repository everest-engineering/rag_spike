She also has a Fox Chase oncologist and I do not see the name of that doctor.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, status post parietal resection many years ago.  Now with significant white matter changes noted on MRI and recent episode with tremulousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable record, and the patient was noted to have a previous craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized from the left hemisphere with a low voltage, 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of beta and theta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm with focal slowing, rhythmic theta, some underlying delta, and a sharp wave noted at T6.  The focal slowing, breach rhythm, and sharply contoured activity is seen nearly constantly through the record.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response from the left.  Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the focal slowing from the right.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Right temporal sharp waves.
Rhythmic theta delta from the right hemisphere maximum posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the right.  There is a prominent epileptogenic focus, but no clinical seizures were noted.
