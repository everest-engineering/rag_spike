CLINICAL HISTORY: 92 year old female with hypersomnolence, pulmonary edema, pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Synthroid, ASA, Keppra, Cefepime, Zithromax

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite somnolent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with markedly slow theta and delta. In addition to significant eye movement and EKG artifact, there is an occasional right temporal sharp wave, some of which is maximum at T2, but on other occasions is more prominent in the posterior temporal region. Those in the posterior temporal region have a bilateral representation. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal but improved EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The triphasic waves described previously as well as the generalized complexes have improved. The sharp waves are quite modest. The background slowing supports a significant bihemispheric disturbance and may be due to this patient's multiple medical and neurologic processes.
