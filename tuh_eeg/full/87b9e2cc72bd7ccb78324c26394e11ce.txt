History:	67 YO MALE S/P MECHANICAL FALL. HAD INCREASED DROWSINESS. FOUND
DIFFUSE SAH. PT HAS A L VENTRIC. NOW FOR FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Intermittent periods of diffuse attenuation for 1-2 seconds.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves
with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an
anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 96
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, intermittent
Triphasic waves, frequent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves, severe diffuse
background slowing and intermittent attenuation.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
