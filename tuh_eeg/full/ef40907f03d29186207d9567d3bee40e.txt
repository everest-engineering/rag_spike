AGE: 69 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/26/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Corna study EEG # : 15-1415
HISTORY:
69 y.o . male with a history of mitral valve replacement, cardiogenic and septic shock, who required sudden intubation just prior to recording and developed intermittent stiffening of arms and legs, as well as eye movements/nystagmus towards the right side. He is currently unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: Received 4 mg Versed within past 2.5 hrs SEDATION : as above
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background consists of disorganized diffuse low amplitude delta with admixed low voltage fast frequencies.
There is no state change, reactivity, or variability with noxious stimulation .
There is severe generalized slowing .
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: There is no reactivity to auditory or noxious stimuli.
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
The patient' s head and upper trunk are captured on video.
Sporadic small truncal flexion movements are noted. Tech also notes "every now and then he will move his legs upward. " There is no change in electrographic activity during these movements .
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to:
Severe generalized slowing and background disorganization
Lack of background reactivity
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
