History:	60 YO MALE TRANSFERRED FROM OSH BY HELICOPTER FOR CRUSH INJURY

ANXIETY/DEPRESSION
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILAUDID, HEPARIN, INSULIN, LORAZEPAM, DOXEPIN,, CELEXA,
NEURONTIN, TAMSULOSIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some state changes with stage 1 and 2 sleep architecture can be seen.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
