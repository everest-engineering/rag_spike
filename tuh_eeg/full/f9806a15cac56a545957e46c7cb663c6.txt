CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed male admitted on 6th after witnessed tonic-clonic seizure with persistent postictal state.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is awake.  Initially, the background EEG is well organized with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  In addition, there are intermittent bursts of irregular, shifting, and relatively generalized mixed theta-delta.  Mixed in those bursts are a handful of sharp waves in the right hemisphere, which are somewhat poorly defined, but subsequently will demonstrate a T2 and T4 phase reversal.  As the recording continues, the patient's alpha rhythm sometimes exceeds 8.5. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Slowing of the alpha rhythm, which improved somewhat over time.
Intermittent bursts of irregular, bilateral slowing.
Rare, subtle, and underlying sharp waves in the right hemisphere particularly midtemporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The dynamic features described above may be a part of an acute, postictal process.  Additional EEG recording may be helpful to more definitively outline epileptiform activity for this individual.
