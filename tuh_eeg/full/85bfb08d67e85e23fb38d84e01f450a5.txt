History:	42 YO FEMALE WITH A HX OF SZ SINCE 2008. 2 TYPES, GTC AND ABSENCE.
LAST SZ. 4 DAYS AGO.
Medications:	ZONEGRAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates.  HR was 54
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
