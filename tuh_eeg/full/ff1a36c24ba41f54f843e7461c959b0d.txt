DATE OF STUDY:  January 21 to January 22.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed overnight with standard seizure and spike detection.  No seizures were reported, but the patient did not sleep well.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is unremarkable, but in sleep, vertex has K complexes with spindles are noted, primarily in stage II sleep, frontally predominant spike and wave and poly spike and wave discharges are normal.  Most of these are isolated, but there are rare bursts where they appear in clusters.  Isolated frontal sharp waves were noted.  On the whole, the epileptiform activity was symmetric.
.
IMPRESSION:  In clinical correlation.  I will hold on that because, the heart rate 80 bpm
