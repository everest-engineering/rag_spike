History:	28 YR OLD MALE WITH H/O SZ. NOW WITH STARRING SPELLS LASTING 10
TO 15 SEC. PMHX., SZ.DM TYPE 2

FOLLOW UP EEG, PT DENIES ANY RECENT SZ ACTIVITY
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, DIVALPROEX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Some of the excess frontal beta at times precedes drowsiness and slow.
This resembles spike and wave but the pattern cannot be clearly define as epileptic.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The above described pattern is suspicious for a
generalized epileptiform discharge. It may be helpful to repeat an EEG avoiding any sedatives that
may cause increased beta such as benzodiazepine or barbituates to clearly define the nature of
this  waveform.
