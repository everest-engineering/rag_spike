CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old left handed female with a history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9 to 10 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Intermittent F7/T3 sharp waves seen.  Two of them had an atypical large field that appeared more generalized maximally in the left anterior temporal region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves with a broad field at times.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region; however, some of the more generalized abnormal pattern suggests either more a generalized lesion or an atypical generalized pattern.  No seizures were seen.
