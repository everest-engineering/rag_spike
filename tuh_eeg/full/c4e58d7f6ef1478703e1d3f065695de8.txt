CLINICAL  HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old woman with simple partial seizures characterized by a twitch in the right eye, with pain.  The spells occur 4-5 times per day up to 10 at night and may last 1 minute in duration.
MEDICATIONS:   Keppra and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:   Routine, 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed   This is a technically satisfactory record.
The patient began to have a seizure with facial twitching without aura at the start of the EEG
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm reaching amplitudes of 60 microvolts.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Very brief sleep with vertex waves, spindle, and POSTS was noted. but stage 2 sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for muscle artifact, but no significant driving.
At the start of the EEG, a single, 7. 7 second burst of 6 hertz muscle activity was noted with rhythmic ocular twitching noted in the right frontal scalp electrodes, most prominent at FP2   There was no epileptiform activity associated with this and no postictal slowing was noted with it  The patient remained awake and alert during this brief bursts and simply experienced ocular twitching.
Hyperventilation produced bilateral slowing a bit more prominent in the posterior regions. Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for
1.  77 second burst of ocular twitching with 6 hertz muscle twitch artifact, otherwise normal background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted in this record. The 77 second burst of 6 hertz muscle twitch artifact did not have an EEG correlate. This could be seen in a simple partial seizure or a process involving the extraocular muscle itself.
