CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with Parkinsonism and a right
parietal lesion, questionable low grade glioma.
MEDICATIONS: Sinemet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
well-organized background with 11 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not activate
the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and anterior spread of
the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG for this individual. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important
consideration, a followup study is suggested.
