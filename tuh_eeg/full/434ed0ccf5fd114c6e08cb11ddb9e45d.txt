History:	87 year old woman who presents with a syncopal episode that was associated with
bowel incontinence.
Medications:	no AEDs.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and low amplitude
5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Shifting and synchronous bitemporal polymorphic theta activity is captured during drowsiness.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22 minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Focal bitemporal slowing captured during drowsiness is considered
normal in patient's over 65 year old.
