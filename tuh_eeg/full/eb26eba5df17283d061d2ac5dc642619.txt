LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Not known.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation was noted performed.  Photic stimulation was  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.  Intermittent independent and synchronous polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the bilateral temporal regions.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Stepped photic stimulation results in appropriate occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Occasional bilateral temporal slowing.
Phase II Sleep
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 22-minute EEG.  Occasional temporal slowing is not considered abnormal in patients of this age.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
