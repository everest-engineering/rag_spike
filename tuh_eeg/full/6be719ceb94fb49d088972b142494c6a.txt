EEG Type: Routine, awake and drowsy.
SEIZURE DISORDER FOR APPROX 15 YRS. PT DESCRIBED EPISODE AS BODY SHAKING, INCONTINENCE OF BLADDER, PT STATED SHE BIT HER TONGUE. LAMOTRIGINE, CARBAMAZEPINE, ZONISAMIDE

MEDICATIONS: LAMOTRIGINE, CARBAMAZEPINE, ZONISAMIDE

SEDATION: None

EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy

Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fr2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation
Waking background is characterized by a low voltage 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 16-25Hz activity is present diffusely. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. One sharp transient is noted concerning for a small fragment of generalized spike and wave.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation is not performed. HR 54

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Diffuse slowing, polymorphic

INTERPRETATION:
This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non specific with regards to etiology. The single discharge is concerning and may aid In clarifying it's nature. No seizures
