History:	31 year old man with a history of seizures, now presents with left  sided weakness
and facial droop.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 24-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. A single EKG lead demonstrates
heart rate <60 bpm.
