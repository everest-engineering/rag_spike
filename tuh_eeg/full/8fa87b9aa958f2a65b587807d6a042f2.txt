CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 71-year-old woman with stage IV metastatic lung cancer, status post chemotherapy and radiation, previous right cerebellar mass, hepatic involvement with serum ammonia 70.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, others, and opiates.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically challenging 40-minute EEG with impedances 105 kilohms.  The patient was semiconscious and had continuous muscle movements intermittently, she would raise her right hand and demonstrated asterixis.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG was markedly abnormal.  Throughout much of the record, it is a medium to high amplitude, chaotic appearing pattern.  There are triphasic waves noted bilaterally with an anterior to posterior lag.  In addition, there are intermittent sharp waves noted from either hemisphere and/or unilateral triphasic waves with an anterior to posterior lag.  In this overall sharply contoured background, there are occipitally predominant sharp waves, a bit more so in the right occipital region than the left and phase reversals are noted at P3 and independently C4 and P4.
Stimulation of the patient produces a lower amplitude more organized theta pattern and then the patient drifts off into the more disorganized pattern.
HEART RATE 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Dynamic pattern with intermittent triphasic waves and higher amplitude, paroxysmal slowing.
Multifocal sharp waves with multiple phase reversals noted in either hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG has features of both a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, including the triphasic waves.  There are also focal features and focal sharp waves.  Consideration for a diffuse, systemic disturbance as well as an irritative cortical process is appropriate.  No clinical seizures were recorded.
