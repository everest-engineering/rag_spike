History:	20YR MALE WITH DEVELOP DELAY, SZS AND AUTISM.  CC OF INCREASED
SEIZURES. LAST SZ WAS WITH SPEECH ARREST.  SZS DESCRIBED AS
STARRING SPELLS.
Medications:	LAMICTAL, VIMPAT , RISPERDAL, ZONEGRAN, GUANFACINE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was seen.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid temporal and bilateral parietal
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal spikes are present at
T4/T6 with a field that spreads towards P4.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
72, some PVCs are noted.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral parietal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Spikes, frequent, right temporal, mid, with a large field that spreads towards the posterior quadrant
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges in the right mid
and posterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures,  are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right
midtemporal and bilateral parietal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No clinical or electrographic
