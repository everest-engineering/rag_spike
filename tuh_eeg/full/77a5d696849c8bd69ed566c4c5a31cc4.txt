CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed woman with sarcoid, recent meningeal biopsy for diffuse septo meningeal enhancement.  She was admitted on May 12, 2012 with 2 seizures lasting 3 minutes with incontinence, abnormal gait, and syncope.  The patient has a right frontal biopsy site.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  There was no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is excess theta noted in the background.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing, a bit more prominent on the right compared to the left.  The patient transitions in and out of stage I and stage II sleep.  There are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta noted in the transition in and out of sleep.  A breech rhythm is noted in the right frontal region.
HR:    66 to 90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Shifting slowing, particularly in the right hemisphere, some of which is sharply contoured, particularly at T4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were seen.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  The FIRDA is a nonspecific finding. The shifting slowing, particularly on the right, may be correlated with this patient's imaging.
