History:	57 YO FEMALE POST S/P RIGHT TEMPORAL. PT  CIMS, UNRESPONSIVE. PT WAS LIGHTHEADED WITH PROGRESSIVE PROBLEMS STANDING OVER THE
PAST WEEK.
Medications:	KEPPRA 1GRAM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  This is at times sharply countoured and appears at times slightly monomorphic.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 120
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left temporal, anterior, at times monomorphic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mid, decrease amplitude
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is continuous focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. Lastly there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
