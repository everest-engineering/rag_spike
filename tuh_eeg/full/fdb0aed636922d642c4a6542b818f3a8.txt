CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old man with traumatic brain injury, bilateral craniectomy, and a history of diabetes, anemia, alcohol abuse, and a seizure episode on February 25.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Depakote
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep was captured.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with posterior dominant rhythm at times which is 8 Hz with a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the right temporal region, maximal at T4 with an associated breach in that region.
Focal slow wave seen frequently at T3 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts and also an associated breached rhythm in that region.
There are generalized slow waves seen throughout the recording at a frequency of 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
HR:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Independent continuous right mid-temporal slowing.
Intermittent left midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal structural serial dysfunction over the right midtemporal region which is consistent with the known injury.  In addition, there is evidence of intermittent focal cerebral dysfunction over the left midtemporal region and diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is also consistent with the known traumatic brain injury, but it may also be seen due to nonspecific metabolic abnormalities and/or medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
