CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old woman with epilepsy, HIV disease, hepatitis C, previous stroke with hemiparesis, psychosis, and head trauma.  The patient reports seizures where she cannot hear, see, or speak for 10 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Atripla, vitamin D, Sudafed, Abilify, fluoxetine, Trileptal, Ativan, and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient seemed to be quite restless and there was a fair amount of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG in wakefulness is disorganized.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8-9 Hz noted bilaterally, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Excess theta was noted in the background as well as a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is more clear underlying focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere with somewhat irregular mixed theta-delta noted intermittently in drowsiness.
Hyperventilation was not possible.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving, this was more vigorous on the right compared to the left.
Heart rate:  84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left hemisphere, maximum in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study may be of value.  In addition, if this individual is thought to have frequent spells, outpatient or inpatient ambulatory monitoring may be of value. Focal slowing may be correlated with MRI given history of stroke
