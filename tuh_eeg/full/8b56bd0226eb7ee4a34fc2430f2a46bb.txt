HISTORY: long standing refractory epilepsy following CVA
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Keppra, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This was a 1 hour EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage and somewhat slow with 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  In drowsiness, there is underlying left greater than right temporal focal slowing and occasional left temporal sharp waves.  Shifting and slowing is noted in drowsiness with some sections of the record having disruption of faster frequency activity.  Features of stage 2 sleep includes POSTS  and spindles.  As stage 2 sleep progresses, there are more well-defined sharp waves noted, particularly in the left temporal region.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  One hour digital video EEG is remarkable for:
Rare left temporal sharp waves noted primarily in deeper stages of sleep.
Focal slowing noted primarily from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  The majority of the EEGs have demonstrated left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves although sharp waves have been noted from the right.  Today's findings are primarily on the left.
No seizures were recorded.  If the patient is thought to have subtle or frequent seizures, EEG monitoring may be of value.
