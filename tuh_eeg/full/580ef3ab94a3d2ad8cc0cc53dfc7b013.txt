CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 21-year-old young man with history of questionable seizure during sleep and intermittent dizziness and left-sided numbness.  He was studied to rule out seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  A routine 21-channel EEG was performed utilizing a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement along with hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and EKG monitoring.  In the awake resting background reveals a moderate amount of 20-30 microvolt amplitude, 9-11 Hz activity posteriorly, which attenuates with eye opening.  Low voltage frontocentral beta-activity was seen, which was bilaterally symmetric.  Moderate amount of muscle eye blink and prominent EKG artifact was seen.  The patient appeared drowsy during much of the record with attenuation of posterior rhythmic activity and diminished beta activity along with increased low to medium amplitude frontocentral 4-6 Hz theta.  Positive occipital sharp transients of sleep were noted (POSTs) followed by progression to stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, central sleep spindles, and occasional K-complexes.  Hyperventilation produced no significant activation of the record.  Photic stimulation produced symmetric occipital driving.  EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm at 62 per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG and normal EEG, exclude clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, more prolonged recording or ambulatory EEG may provide further diagnostic information.
