CLINICAL HISTORY:  31 year old right handed male with a past medical history of seizures, the last one in 2007, tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and tongue bite.  EEG for evaluation of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient reaches stage I sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves at F8/T4, seen almost continuously at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  In addition, there is some intermittent F7/T3 slowing to 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal more than left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region which has correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is some evidence of left anterior temporal cerebral dysfunction, which is not specific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
