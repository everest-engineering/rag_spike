CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old male with history of recent onset dementia and forgetfulness.
MEDICATIONS:  Cyclobenzaprine, Xanax, tramadol, Aricept, Tylenol, Miralax, Namenda, tamsulosin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 6-7 Hz in frequency and 30-50 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  The background activity is characterized by delta activity with a frequency of 1.8-2.5 Hz frontally predominant delta activity intermixed with 5-6 Hz theta activity.  There are intermittent bursts of frontal intermittent delta activity, (FIRDA) seen with a frequency of 1-1.2 Hz and amplitude of 50-70 microvolt lasting for 2-3 seconds. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation result in no responses. Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to the slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and background activity and the presence of FIRDA bursts during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic encephalopathy, degenerative brain disease, increased intracranial pressure, or a deep midline lesion in the brain.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record. No seizures are captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.
