REASON FOR STUDY:  Concern for seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 25-year-old man status post craniectomy and C1-C2 laminectomy with a history of cryptococcal meningitis, now evaluating for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, metoprolol, Lovenox, ceftriaxone, Risperdal, and dexamethasone.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead  EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while poorly responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some A1 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Heart rate 110 to 120.
The record opens to an abnormal, diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontal central beta.  At times as the patient blinks or moves there appears to be some artifact and there appears to be slight improvement in the frequencies, but overall he remains generally slow at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.  No activating procedures were performed.  No clear sleep architecture is seen.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous moderate to severe generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
