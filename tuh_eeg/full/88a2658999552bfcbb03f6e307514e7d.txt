CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer disease, history of epilepsy. The patient typically has infrequent seizures, but since her Haldol dose was decreased, family note increasingly frequent seizures characterized by tonic stiffening, generalized shaking, and followed by screaming.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Prozac, gabapentin, aspirin, Vimpat, Haldol, and others.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was relatively drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern with a mixture of delta and theta frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in delta. On 1 or 2 occasions, there is a small amount of frontal beta. Rare, discrete low amplitude frontal triphasic sharp waves were noted.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to marked generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were seen. The generalized background slowing is a nonspecific finding, which can be seen in many different clinical constellations including toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, but this pattern is a relatively typical pattern for an advanced dementia.
Previous EEGs were not available for comparison at this time.
