CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old male with another episode of agitation, possible complex partial seizures today.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Ativan, Seroquel, Haldol, ASA,lovenox. Protonix, Metoprolol,
lorazepam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a prominent left craniotomy.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern. Both
hemispheres are somewhat slow with primarily a theta frequency pattern on the right and on the left more of a theta delta pattern. Sharp waves are noted from the left hemisphere with some polyspike components. Today they are most prominent at C3 but they are also picked up at F3. Ativan is ordered during the EEG. At some times with epileptiform activity, it seems to start at FP1 and then transition to F3. Photic stimulation is performed and produces scant driving on the right. The Ativan is given approximately 25 minutes into the EEG. This produces an increase in beta but does not particularly change the epileptiform activity.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. left frontal and central sharp waves and spikes.
2. Background slowing.
3. Focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern is significantly improved compared to last week's
EEG. Additional clinical management may be the idea way to manage this individual's complex partial seizures followed by agitation.
