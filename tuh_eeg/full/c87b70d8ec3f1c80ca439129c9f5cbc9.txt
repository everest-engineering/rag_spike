History:	72 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS S/P FALL NOW WITH MULTI SZ NOTED WHILE IN
ED. SAH IN 1980'S - RIGHT SIDED SCAR THROUGH F4

FOLLOW UP EEG.. PT NOT WAKING UP
Medications:	ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN, DILANTIN, INSULIN, HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present but there appeared to be a state change at
the end of the record with more pronounced delta and decreased amplitude.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 120
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right frontal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of nearly continuous focal slowing in the
right frontal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region,
likely structural in origin.In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
