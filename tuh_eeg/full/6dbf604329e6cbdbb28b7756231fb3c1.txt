CLINICAL HISTORY:   89 year old right handed female with history of CAD, CVA, MI, CHF, DJD, presented with slurred speech, left-sided weakness and numbness.
MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin, Furosemide, Simvastatin, Lopressor
REASON FOR STUDY:  Left-sided numbness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at C4/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Intermittent right central temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right central temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
