CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 41-year-old male with episodes of staring and twitching without loss of consciousness.  Right facial twitching, which may last a day.  Previous event 1 day prior.  Possible multiple sclerosis.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and posts.  Intermittent arousals from stage II sleep were identified.  Snore artifact was noted.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep.  Minimal driving was noted.  Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  This patient's facial twitching did not appear to have been recorded.
