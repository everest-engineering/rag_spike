History:	66 YO FEMALE ADMITTED FOR LUNG TRANSPLANT. EEG TO EVALUATE
UNRESPONSIVENESS X 2 DAYS.
PMH: COPD / HTN
Medications:	LABETALOL, INSULIN, CARDIZEM, LACTULOSE, LIDOCAINE, DILTIAZEM,
PANTOPRAZOLE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
disorganized theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Intermittent prolonged diffuse bursts of frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic
morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to
posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was irregular and 121
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Triphasic waves, frequent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and moderate
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
