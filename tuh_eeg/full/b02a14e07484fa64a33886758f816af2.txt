CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 40-year-old woman, who had oral facial surgery on May 29th, and single postop seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab on a stretcher using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is extremely limited in her mobility.  Photic stimulation was performed, but hyperventilation had to be deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Head rocking movement was noted in the record.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits primarily in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The overall background is unremarkable.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
