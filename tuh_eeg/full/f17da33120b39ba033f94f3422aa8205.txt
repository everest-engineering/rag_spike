CLINICAL HISTORY:  Seizures following cerebrovascular disease with a right cranial shunt.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Dilantin, Keppra, aspirin and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.  The patient was noted to have some oral facial dyskinesias.
TECHNICAL:  There is some impedance issues.  The patient's oral facial movement produced some artifact, but the EEG is quite interpretable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres.  The activity has slightly higher amplitude on the right compared to the left.  There is an alpha rhythm of 7.5 to 8 Hz which is higher amplitude on the right, compatible with a breach, but is slightly disrupted on the left.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a subtle underlying driving response with harmonic and sub-harmonic driving.
Heart rate 66 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A bilaterally slow background.
A somewhat slower pattern on the left with a disruptive alpha rhythm on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The breach rhythm described above with higher amplitude on the right is compatible with the history of a shunt on the right.  The asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres may be correlated with imaging.  In this individual with a history of epilepsy or seizures, no sharp-waves or spikes were seen today.  Comparison with previous EEGs or a more extended study capturing sleep may be of value.
