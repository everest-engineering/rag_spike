CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old woman with severe, systemic illnesses, end-stage renal disease, prolonged hospitalization with clinical seizures on the 22nd.
MEDICATIONS:  Darbepoetin, Daptomycin, Hydrocortisone, Keppra, Valproic Acid
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside while the patient is undergoing dialysis, using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  She has tactile stimulation throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow, mixed frequency pattern with theta and delta.  Stimulation of the patient produces muscle.  There is some spontaneous grimacing.
HR:    114 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow pattern.
Small amount of shifting slowing.
Paucity of variability and reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified in this record.  This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function.  These findings may be placed in the appropriate clinical context.
