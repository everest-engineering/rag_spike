CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old woman with migraine headaches and diabetes.  Now with chronic daily headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, glipizide, metformin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient's previous EEGs:  July 24, 2003 and April 19, 2005, were not available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Focal slowing is noted in the left frontal temporal region.  Wicket is also noted in this region and seems to accentuate the focal slowing.
Hyperventilation produces some bitemporal slowing, but also accentuates the left frontal temporal focal slowing.
As the patient becomes drowsy, the left temporal slowing transitions more to a mid temporal localization.  Vertex waves were identified in stage I sleep.  Vertex waves and K-complexes are seen in stage II sleep.  The focal slowing is not as prominent in deeper stages of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Intermittent focal slowing in the left mid to anterior temporal region in wakefulness and hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were identified.  This patient's previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study and/or comparison studies and imaging may be of value.
