CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old male with poorly controlled epilepsy, monthly seizures which the patient has difficulty describing.
MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, Fioricet, Ultram, Depakote, Flexeril, Topamax, Keppra, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This EEG included sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements with spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.  POSTS were noted.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produced a small increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 1-hour electroencephalogram in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this adult.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged tracing, capturing, and event or an inpatient EEG session may be of value.
