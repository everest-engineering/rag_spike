CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old male status post code at 7:00 a.m. this morning, now with myoclonus, T102, gag, and spontaneous respirations, otherwise comatose.
MEDICATIONS:  Vasopressin, epinephrine, Neo, and others, but no sedative hypnotic medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, comatose, and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage, essentially suppressed with muscle artifact.  There is a scant amount of background, low voltage mixed delta/theta.  There is no reactivity or definitive variability.
Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This bedside ICU record for this comatose patient was remarkable for:
Paucity of cerebral activity.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings carry worrisome prognostic features.  In that this patient had involuntary movements earlier today, long-term EEG monitoring was initiated.
