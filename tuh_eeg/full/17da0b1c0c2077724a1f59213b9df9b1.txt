Medications:	DILANTIN GIVEN THIS AM AT 5:00 AM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some normal sleep architecture is seen including spindles.
Attenuation of faster frequencies over the right frontal region is noted  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Attenuation, continuous, right frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of attenuation of faster frequencies over the right frontal
region, which is suggestive of a cortical lesion in this region. In addition there is moderate diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
