History:
Medications:	HEPARIN 9:48 AM 5000 UNITS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present throughout
the entire study.  The waking background does appear to show some diffuse slowing related to
sedation.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite prolonged clinical sleep.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region during
wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  INCISION 9:44AM, HEPARIN 9:48 AM
5000 UNITS, COIL 1ST 10:23A. No changes seen in the EEG background after coil was placed.
Summary of Findings:
Other, Uneventful EEG monitoring during angiogram and coiling.
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful one hour EEG monitoring during angiogram and left aneurysm coiling.
Please note there is focal slowing noted on the right anterior temporal region which is an
abnormality suggesting focal cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
