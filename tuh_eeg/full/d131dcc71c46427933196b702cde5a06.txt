CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right-handed woman with recurrent glioblastoma,
status post resection in 2006, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, but 2 seizures, found on
the floor in the hospital by nurses in the bathroom, now with episodes of staring at home
lasting hours.

MEDICATIONS: Detrol, Crestor, Keppra

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm.
There is a prominent increase in amplitude in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally.
There appears to be a breach with more sharply contoured activity in the left
anterotemporal region. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the background,
particularly in the temporal regions, with sharply contoured activity in both temporal
regions and despite what is likely a breach rhythm, left anterotemporal sharp waves.
Following hyperventilation as the patient becomes drowsy, shifting arrhythmic delta
activity can be identified from either temporal region, some of which is sharply
contoured, again at T3 more so than T 4. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation does not significantly alter the record.

HR: 50 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing and shifting arrhythmic delta activity in the left temporal region.
2. Likely left anterotemporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: T o more completely evaluate potential underlying sharp
waves, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
