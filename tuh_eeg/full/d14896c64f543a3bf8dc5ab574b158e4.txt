CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 81-year-old woman for EEG monitoring for possible hypothermic protocol.  Temp 34.6.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam.
INTRODUCTION:  Intraoperative monitoring was recorded from 7:21 a.m. until 9:48 a.m.  This recording was performed in anticipation of possible utilization of hypothermic protocol.  Physician was available for remote review and physician remote review was employed for 50 minutes, from 8:10 until 9 a.m.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG begins with the patient somewhat sedated.  The patient is awake with a posterior dominant rhythm with a generous beta, theta, and occasional shifting slowing.  An 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm was noted.  At 7:42, anesthetic medications are employed and EEG demonstrates an increase in background slowing.
Anesthetic medications are adjusted from 9 a.m. and EEG recording is intermittently pause for Bovie and other maneuvers.  The EEG demonstrates an intermittently discontinuous pattern.
Shortly after 9 a.m., the surgeon changes the operative strategy and EEG monitoring was not required.  The team signed out of the OR at 9:48, at which point there was a discontinuous pattern, compatible with anesthesia.
HEART RATE 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Limited intraoperative monitoring demonstrated symmetric, relatively normal awake baseline and the appearance of a burst suppression pattern with the utilization of anesthesia.
