H/ O HA, LIGHT SENSITIVE
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN, CARBATROL, FOLVITE, COLACE, TOPAMAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is 7 Hz diffuse theta activity during wakefulness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region, maximum at T3,
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not completed.  Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.
