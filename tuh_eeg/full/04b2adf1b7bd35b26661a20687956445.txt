History:	50 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ ONSET OVER 2O YEARS AGO.
GRAND MAL. PT LAST SZ 1 1/2 YRS AGO.
Medications:	TRILEPTAL 300 MG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral anterior temporal
region (left more than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional brief 1-2
seconds bursts of generalized frontally-maximal 3-3.5 Hz spike-and-wave discharges occur during
the recording.  No clinical symptoms associated with the bursts.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, occasional generalized
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of occasional generalized spike-and-wave
discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise normal.  These
findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy. In addition there was
intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal region (left more than right) region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
