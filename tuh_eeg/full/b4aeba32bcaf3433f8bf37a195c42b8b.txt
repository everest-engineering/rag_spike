History:	35 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Last seizure occurred ~1-2 weeks ago.
Medications:	keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent brief bursts (up to 7 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal
spike-and-wave discharges and polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition
rate of ~4 Hz.  These discharges occur most frequently during drowsiness and  sleep.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric
photic driving at high flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, 4 Hz, bursts up to 7 sec
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 23-minute EEG because of frequent generalized 4 Hz
spike-and-wave discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic.  Background activity is otherwise
normal.  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.  Excessive
beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
