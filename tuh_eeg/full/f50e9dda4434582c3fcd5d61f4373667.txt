MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is awake.  The background EEG includes generous beta and excess theta.  This is a post ictal recording and as the recording continues, the patient is increasingly awake with a scant alpha rhythm.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to background slowing most prominent in the initial sections of the record.There is a subtle asymmetry noted in the initial sections of the record with disruption of faster frequency of activity in the right hemisphere relative to the left and a small amount of slowing.
EEG which is abnormal due:
Resolving generalized slowing.
Subtle focal slowing with additional focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Comparison with this patient's previous EEGs may be valuable.
