HISTORY: 23 year old male with new onset seizures,
MEDICATIONS: None
Clinical Center
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was preformed at bedside using
standard 10-20system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient
keeps a log. He is able to push the button for all of the events that he experiences. He
has multiple episodes of dizziness or disorienting feeling.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz posterior
dominant rhythm which is symmetrically reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by
rhythmic background theta with vertex waves, spindles and stage II sleep. There is an
epoch in which REM sleep is seen.
In the interictal EEG, there is a single left temporal sharp wave.
Events: The patient has multiple dizzy spells including 129, 125, 312, 336, 536, 546
and then there are no additional push buttons noted.
Although not all of the seizures have a clear clinical correlate and some have only either
subtle theta or subtle disruption of faster frequency activity in the left temporal region,
some have clear, rhythmic 4 hertz theta from the left temporal region with some spread
to the frontocentral region bilaterally, typically lasting 20-40 seconds. The patient
receives Depakote at 2:20p.m., the discharges are briefer, more evanescent
more allusive.
Event time 12930: the patient has a dizzy spell characterized by decreased alpha
frequency activity from the left temporal region and a brief burst of left temporal theta.
Event time: 2:32 p.m.: There is a brief burst of left temporal theta which differs from the
background.
Event time: 3:12p.m.: Aura of dizziness, left temporal theta.
Event #3: Aura characterized by dizziness lime 335 to 33729, rhythmic temporal theta
as described above.
