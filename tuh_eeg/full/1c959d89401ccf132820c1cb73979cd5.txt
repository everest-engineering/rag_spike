History:	69 YR. OLD MALE R HANDED SURGERY TOMORROW 8-20-14 CAROTID
ENDARTERECTOMY LEFT. BASE LINE FOR SURGERY 59 CM HEAD

PRESENTS NOW FOR RT CEA.
Medications:	DIOVAN, HYDRALAZINE, COLCHICINE, GLIPIZIDE, ASPIRIN, METOPROLOL,
FUROSEMIDE, EPLERENONE, ATORVASTATIN, IMDUR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As the recording continued the EEG had more diffuse theta and alpha
and at times there was intermixed attenuation for seconds.  Adjustments were made but the team to
the BP and anesthesia to maintain a more continuous record.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
HR was 60  Internal Carotid was clamped at 9:34 AM, Common carotid was clamped at 9:35.
Clamping lasted for 55 minutes.  During clamping there was a slight asymmetry 1on the right
hemisphere This was communicated to the team  It subsided in seconds with BP adjustment.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a uneventful EEG, during a left CEA.
