History:	67 year old woman with a recent left PCA stroke and events concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Valproic acid
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by polymorphic up to 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm posteriorly.
Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess
diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during
drowsiness.  Sleep architecture consisting of vertex waves and brief sleep spindles is captured.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the left posterior quadrant.  Less
frequent left anterior temporal delta activity is noted.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an
irregular heart rate, premature QRS complexes and inter-QRS pauses of up to 1.5 seconds in
Summary of Findings:

Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 32 minutes EEG due to continuous moderate left
posterior quadrant focal slowing and occasional moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing.
These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction over the left hemisphere, probably structural in
etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate, premature QRS
complexes and inter-QRS pauses of up to 1.5 seconds in duration.  Mild diffuse slowing indicates
