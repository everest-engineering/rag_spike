CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed woman with syncope and headaches, past history of closed head injury in June 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  HCTZ, Lymphedema, Aspirin, Omeprazole.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Central mu activity is noted, but testing is not performed to confirm this. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background and a small amount of slowing. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements, attenuation of the alpha, and POSTS.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were observed.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
