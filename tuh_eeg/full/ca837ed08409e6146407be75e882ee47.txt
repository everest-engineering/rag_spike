CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 35-year-old right-handed man with a history of migraines, presents with sharp pain in the back of his head, and eyes lasting all day.  He denies any seizure activity for the past 2 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Topamax, and Bactrim.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm, 9.5-10 Hz of which in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is low amplitude diffuse beta-activity, which is distributed symmetrically, stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts and stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background, and photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy if seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.  The presence of diffuse beta-activity is indicated of anxiety or hyperthyroidism or it could be due to barbiturate or benzodiazepines.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
