History:	65 year male with new onset seizures.
Medications:	Ativan, Citalopram, Oxcarbazepine, Trazodone
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm is unstable and very fragmented at 6.5-7 Hz low-to-moderate
amplitude polymorphic theta activity.  There is no clear AP gradient.  The background consists
primarily of low amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp
waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms
demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR was 54.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Triphasic waves, intermittent
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and triphasic waveforms.
These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically
nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
