History:	61 year old woman who had  two seizures last night at home with associated fall
and bruising of the eye and scalp. Patient is currently hospitalized for pneumonia.
Medications:	valium, neurontin, tramadol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Prominent posterior and diffuse rhythmic ~5 Hz activity is observed.  Some
of it appears to represent slow alpha variant.  During drowsiness this activity slows to ~3-4 Hz and
becomes more pronounced.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular
Summary of Findings:
No focal slowing
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is likely a normal awake and drowsy 27 minute EEG.  Posterior and diffuse rhythmic activity in
the theta range appears benign and is of uncertain clinical significance.  A repeat prolonged EEG
with sleep may be beneficial to further identify this finding.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on
a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
