History:	29 YO FEMALE WITH DX FROM OSH OF SMALL MASS IN POSTERIOR REGION.
NO VISION OR SENSORY ISSUES, PT REPORTS DIZZINESS W/O LOC. NOT
SLEEPING WELL.
Medications:	CITALOPRAM, TRIFLUOPERAZINE, COGENTIN, BENADRYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Single focal sharp wave with phase reversal and amplitude maximum
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Hr was
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, single, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of a single epileptiform discharges in the
left frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region.  A repeat prolonged EEG capturing stage two sleep is recommended to better characterize
the above finding.
