CLINICAL HISTORY:  Rasmussen's encephalitis.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, IVIG, Glucosamine, phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG with long term EEG monitoring is performed in the long term monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has a tender scalp and the tech sometimes had to modify the electrode placement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The interictal EEG continues to demonstrate focal slowing from the left hemisphere with left posterior temporal sharp waves.  Multiple seizures are identified in the 24 hour section, including in wakefulness and sleep.  The patient does not seem to wake up for all of them.  Stage II sleep, including the 2:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. section are prominent.  The nurses were aware of the seizures in sleep.  These seizures seem to be beginning with a burst of fast activity, almost some 10 to 5 Hz which is picked up very close to the midline.  The activity is really very prominent at CZ where it is a 10 Hz discharge.  This evolves to more of a theta frequency pattern and then the posterior temporal spikes continue.
Most seizures are under 30 seconds in duration.
Heart rate:  80 BPM.
By the morning of February 25, 2012, the seizures had improved.
IMPRESSION:  Additional EEG recording will follow.
