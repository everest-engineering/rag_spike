CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 56-year-old male with pulmonary hypertension, schizophrenia, shortness of breath, baseline EEG for thrombectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20 minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was awake and cooperative.  This is a technically satisfactory urgent record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a medium amplitude record with 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but the background includes excess 6-7 Hz rhythmic theta.  On rare occasions, there is some irregular, shifting delta.  Sleep was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for this adult due to,
Excess theta.
Mild background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's neurocognitive diagnosis or medications used to treat that diagnosis may produce the pattern described above.  In addition, a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function may also produce the findings noted.  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG was utilized for this patient's baseline EEG.
