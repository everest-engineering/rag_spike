History:	71 year old woman status post double lung transplant nearly 1 month ago, now with
diffuse tremors that involve her face as well.
Medications:	Ativan, Dilaudid, prograf, daptomycin, meropenem, bactrim
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Majority of the recording contains high frequency tremor artifact that is seen in various leads.
During several periods of relative tremor-free period, the background consists of low amplitude
polymorphic theta activity.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate of >100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, tremor, abundant
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23-minute portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Nearly continuous tremors are not associated with an abnormal ictal activity.
