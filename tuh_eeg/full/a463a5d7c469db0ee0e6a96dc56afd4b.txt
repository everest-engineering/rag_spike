CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 94-year-old woman with dementia and seizures.  Limited historian.  Last seizure 1.5 years ago.  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age with an alpha rhythm of 8.329 hertz.  There is rare slowing in either hemisphere.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically challenging EEG for a poorly cooperative patient. Photic stimulation was performed
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 8-9 Hz PDR which is reactive.  Age appropriate infrequent temporal slowing is seen in brief drowsiness.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No prior EEGs are available at this time for comparison.  No epileptiform features were seen and this EEG is by and large acceptable for a subject of this age.
