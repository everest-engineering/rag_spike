CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old woman status post code in the field and then transferred to Temple with a second PEA code on the 16th at midnight.  The patient was placed on hypothermic protocol but became bradycardic and the protocol was stopped.
MEDICATIONS:  Dopamine, prednisone, vancomycin, epinephrine, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  In addition, the ECS protocol was utilized.  Stimulation of the patient was performed.  Electro-integrity was checked.  The data can be reviewed digitally with alternative montages and changes in sensitivity as appropriate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no electrocerebral activity identified.  ICU artifact and EKG artifact was noted.  Stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.  Tactile stimulation of the electrodes produced artifact.
HEART RATE:  102 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:  Absence of cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In the appropriate clinical context, this EEG may be utilized for brain death evaluation.
