CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman with past medical history of diabetes and hypertension who was brought by her family for change in mental status for the last 10 days.  The patient has been very slow in responding, complaining of bifrontal headache and blurry vision intermittently.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications are aspirin, hydralazine, Lipitor, metformin, metoprolol, levothyroxine, Evista.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated  9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  The posterior dominant rhythm is minimally slower over the left hemisphere.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness diffuse bursts of frontally predominant delta activity (FIRDA) captured.  Frequent left frontotemporal slowing in delta range is captured, at times appearing sharply contoured.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
FIRDA.
Frequent moderate left frontotemporal slowing, that is sharply contoured.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 21 minute EEG due to frequent moderate focal slowing over the left frontotemporal region.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) indicates nonspecific encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure, deep white matter disease.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured; however, left frontotemporal slowing was often sharply contoured.
