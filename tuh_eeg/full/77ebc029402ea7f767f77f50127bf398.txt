CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old transplant patient, admitted on 1/13. Traumatic Subarachnoid hemorrhage 1/7; past history of stroke, atrial fibrillation and surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Folate, Keppra, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is a bedside record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a diffuse theta pattern.  Eye blink artifact and lateral rectus eye movement artifacts were noted.
Intermittent agitation or muscle artifact was noted as the patient moved about.  There are rare bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The features described above are nonspecific and support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  A toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other bihemispheric disturbance could produce this pattern.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of value.
