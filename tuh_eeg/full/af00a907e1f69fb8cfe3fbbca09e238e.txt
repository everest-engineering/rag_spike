CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old woman with 2-year history of epilepsy.  Patient also suffers from anxiety attacks.  Has episodes with loss of consciousness, confusion, shaking.  Past history of conversion disorder, depression, and bipolar illness.  This is a repeat, 1-hour EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Klonopin, Risperdal, Prozac, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 1-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances under 5 kilo ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm, symmetric and reactive to eye opening with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  Central Mu activity was likely seen but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Photic stimulation elicited brief driving.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 1-hour EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  Previous studies were not available at this time for comparison.
