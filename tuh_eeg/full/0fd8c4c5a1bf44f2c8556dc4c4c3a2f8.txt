History:	61 YR FEMALE WITH INCREASE IN SZS. 1-2 WK. ONSET LIGHTHEADED, NAUSEOUS, VISUAL DISTURBANCE THEN SLIGHT TICK LIKE MM. POST TIRED. ONSET SZS AGE 13. NEURO EVAL FOR EMU
Medications:	TRILEPTAL, REMERON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.

Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions (left more than right)
, at times sharply contoured and with a more anterior field. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR was 66

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid Excessive fast

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal regions (left more than right). This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
