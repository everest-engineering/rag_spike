CLINICAL HISTORY:  Continuing EEG monitoring for patient status post cardiac arrest on the morning of the 17th.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and midazolam.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the bedside in the ICU.  The patient was examined.  CAT scans demonstrate cerebral edema.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This last section of the EEG demonstrates a frontally predominant relatively generalized periodic complexes and polyphasic components.  It is relatively invariant but there is a small amount of theta.
Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
Over the last few hours of EEG recording, the periodic activity does demonstrate some waxing and waning but the well-defined ictal pattern described earlier is not prominent.  The waxing and waning is seen only at very slow paper speed.
Heart rate:  90 beats per minute
IMPRESSION:  This 72-hour video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Early ictal pattern following cardiac arrest.
Replacement with a slow generalized periodic complex.
Marked background slowing.
Absence of significant reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is supportive of a severe underlying anoxic encephalopathy.
