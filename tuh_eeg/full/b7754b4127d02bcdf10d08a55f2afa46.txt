CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old woman found down on June 26, intubated in the field, cocaine screen positive.  Patient subsequently transferred on the 28th after multiple, recurrent seizures, anoxic encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is postictal, intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an initial pattern with prominent bursts of fast activity in the central regions.  These bursts of shifting fast activity are slightly asynchronous.  The fast activity is frontocentral, but without a definitive epileptiform complex.  As the recording continues, the EEG transitions to more of a theta pattern with vertex waves, some of which have a slight asymmetry.  The after-going slow wave for some of these is a little bit more prominent on the left.
HR:    N/A.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An unusual pattern with paroxysmal frontocentral fast activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are shifting asymmetries noted in this record.  The paroxysmal activity is relatively symmetric.  Additional EEG recording was performed to assess for any additional seizures or focality.
