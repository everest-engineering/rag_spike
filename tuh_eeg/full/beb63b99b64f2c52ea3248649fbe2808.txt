DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. The patient is quite drowsy, transitioning from wakefulness into drowsiness and then as she starts to transition into stage 2 sleep there is spontaneous arousal. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude and a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features identified. The transitions in and out of sleep with bursts of sleep occur even during photic stimulation may occur in the context of sleep deprivation. It may also be seen in an individual who is sleepy or any other cause.
