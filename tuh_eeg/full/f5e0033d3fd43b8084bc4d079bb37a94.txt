CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right-handed male found unresponsive in the bathroom by his girlfriend.  Poorly responsive for 2 minutes, past history of head injury while playing football.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 30 Hz microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with rhythmic, frontocentral theta. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.

HR:    48 bpm and slightly irregular.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with bradycardia and slightly irregular heart rate.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Clinical evaluation may be appropriate to determine the next best steps.
