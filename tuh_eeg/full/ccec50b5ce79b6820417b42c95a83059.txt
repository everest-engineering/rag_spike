CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 77-year-old woman with COPD, lung disease, admitted with an episode on the 24th of generalized shaking, attributed to hypoglycemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Moxifloxacin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 9 Hz but typically slower at 7 Hz.  There are bursts of bilateral, paroxysmal slowing, FIRDA and bursts of shifting slowing.  This is a relatively high amplitude record and is relatively sharply contoured.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.  Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent slowing of the background in wakefulness.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing, sometimes a bit more prominent on the right.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Overall, this EEG suggests a metabolic pattern.  In this individual with a persistent change in mental status, ongoing evaluation may be appropriate.
