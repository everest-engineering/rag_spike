History:	H/O SEIZURES, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MORBID OBESITY,
CHOLECYSTECTOMY.
FIRST  SEIZURE- 5 YRS. AGO, LAST SEIZURE- 8 MO.  SLEEP STUDY 11/25/13
Medications:	Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present.  During
brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Diffuse beta activity
, Normal
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
