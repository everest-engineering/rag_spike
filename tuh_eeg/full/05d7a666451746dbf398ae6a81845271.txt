SEDATION: none given TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is symmetric and consists of a mixture of diffuse theta with some delta.	There is no - alpha nor normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is not captured. Sleep I drowsiness: the background attenuates briefly
Marked generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY: FIRDA ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation: no driving was elicited EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.Irregular IMPRESSION:
l.Markedly slow
Intermittently attenuates.
There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Most supportive a diffuse process such as toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
Somnolent patient.
This EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
