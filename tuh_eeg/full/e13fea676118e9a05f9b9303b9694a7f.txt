CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old right handed man with history of HIV, seizures and hepatitis C that presents with a tonic-clonic seizure on 10/23/2011 after falling from a bike and having some confusion.  He stated that he ran out of Dilantin for a month.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Percocet, Lovenox, Ancef.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizure
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional EKG and anterior temporal electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep, stage I, was recorded.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts, which has reacted to eye opening.  Frontocentral beta is seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow-wave seen at F7-T3 at 2 to 4 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts amplitude occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
