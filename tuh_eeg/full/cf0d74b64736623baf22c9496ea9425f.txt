CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old woman with epilepsy since infancy. Last seizure 2
days ago, complicated by bipolar disease.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lexapro, Temazepam, Seroquel, Klonopin, Clonazepam
Divalproex

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hertz, 20 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta
activity. Drowsiness is characterized by bursts of FIRDA. In addition, there is
prominent beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. In sleep there is some
head rocking artifact but no definitive epileptiform activity. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for excess beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. The beta
described above may be due to this patient's medications.
