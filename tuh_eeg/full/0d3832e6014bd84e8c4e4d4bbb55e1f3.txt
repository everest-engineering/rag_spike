HISTORY: 29 YO MAN WITH TREMORS SINCE HIS EARLY TWENTIES. THEY ARE BECOMING WORSE SINCE 3/2011. THE TREMORS LAST FOR HOURS WITH WHOLE BODY SHAKING. HAD TREMOR DURING THE EEG TODAY. PATIENT REMAINED COHERENT.
MEDICATIONS: PAXIL, FOLIC ACID.
SEDATION: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
TECHNIQUE: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
DESCRIPTION: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present. maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity. frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation. and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. During the EEG the patient appears to have a tremor but it cannot be well visualized on the video. The EEG reveals a continuous emg artifact that stops once the patient falls a sleep. once he wakes up the EMG artifact returns 10 minutes later.
HR 60
IMPRESSION: This is a NORMAL EEG, awake. drowsy, and asleep. The EMG artifact had no EEG correlate.
