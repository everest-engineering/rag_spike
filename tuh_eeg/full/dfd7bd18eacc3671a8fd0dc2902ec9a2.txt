CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old right handed woman admitted to the hospital because of fall and complaining of headache. The CT shows a right occipital bleed.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Keppra, Labetalol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not intubated and arousable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record showed a disorganized background of alpha activity that ranges from 7-10 Hz. There is some right sided intermittent delta activity coming from the occipital portion. The overall study is low voltage. There is intermittent right sided posterior quadrant slowing. When the patient is drowsy there is increased slowing.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Disorganized background slowing.
2. Focal right sided posterior quadrant slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity, however, there is focal slowing in the posterior portion congruent with the hemorrhage.
