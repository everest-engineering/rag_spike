Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 8-8.5 Hz in frequency.  There is excess
diffuse theta activity during wakefulness.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse theta activity during wakefulness. These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
