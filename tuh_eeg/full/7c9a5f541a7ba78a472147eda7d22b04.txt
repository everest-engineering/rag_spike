History:	41 year old woman with an episode of loss of consciousness.
Medications:	xanax (none today)
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 25-minute portable EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A
single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
