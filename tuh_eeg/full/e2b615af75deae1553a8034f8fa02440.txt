REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 26-year-old woman with history of seizures since age 15, diagnosed with grand mal seizures on January 1, 2012.  She states her seizures __________ sometimes due to fatigue and stress.  No aura with the seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal XR.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.
The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.  However, during hyperventilation there were 2 short lasting bursts, lasting less than 400 milliseconds of anteriorly predominant sharply contoured discharges suspicious for a fragment of generalized spike and wave.  Again, this is only seen twice in short segments during hyperventilation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Two small bursts of anteriorly predominant sharply contoured transient followed by slowing concerning for fragments of generalized spike and wave.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  108.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to sharply contoured frontal predominant spikes concerning for fragmented spike and wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The fragmented spike and waves are suggestive of generalized epilepsy.  To confirm this finding a prolonged EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.  No seizures were seen.
