CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old female 6-months pregnant with her second pregnancy, with a history of epilepsy since infancy.  Last seizure about 1 year ago described as generalized tonic clonic activity with loss of consciousness.  She was never treated with seizure medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal multivitamins.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 anterior temporal electrode and EKG electrode.  Wakefulness and sleep was recorded.  Photic stimulation was not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz with amplitude of 20-60 mV which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a moderate amount of frontal central beta activity.  Also drowsiness is characterized by diffuse slowing in delta frequency at 1-2 Hz.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and 2 with vertex waves and POSTS.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Asynchronous vertex waves are seen between 2 sides with no epileptiform discharges recorded.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Asynchronous vertex waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG showed asynchronous vertex waves which is nonspecific in terms of etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
