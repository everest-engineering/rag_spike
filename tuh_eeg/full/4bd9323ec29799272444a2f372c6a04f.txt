DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of background theta.  Movement artifact is noted as the patient tries to become comfortable.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.
HR:    126 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
A small amount of background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEG's for this individual.  None of them have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  This patient's medications or a toxic or metabolic illness could account for the theta identified today.
