CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old male with teenage epilepsy, previously seizure-free, new seizure type:sweating, headaches, funny taste in the mouth before loss of consciousness, and shaking.  Postictal state lasts several days.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  40-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with a 6-7 hertz and 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with vertex waves, and minimal spindles.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow alpha rhythm.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The diffuse background slowing is a nonspecific finding, medications or other mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function could play a role.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be a value.
