CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed female with a history of head trauma in 2003, tonic-clonic seizures for 20 minutes. The patient stopped medications but when seizures recurred, they were more severe than before.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in beta and theta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep
