REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old man with history of alcohol abuse with a seizure, last drink 2 weeks ago, hyponatremia, alcohol abuse, seizure, malnutrition, lung nodules, COPD.
MEDICATIONS:  Pantoprazole, heparin, morphine, erythromycin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, there is diffuse delta slowing with, at times, intermixed theta and alpha frequencies in the central region.  At times, there is diffuse muscle artifact and variability, but no major improvement in the frequency.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing seen intermittently at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts at times fairly frequently.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right midtemporal focal slowing, as well as generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, as well as moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform activity was seen.
