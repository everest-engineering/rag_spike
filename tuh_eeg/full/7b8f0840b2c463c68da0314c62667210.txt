CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old female with right MCA/ACA stroke now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Hydralazine.
REASON FOR EEG:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video LTM EEG for 15 hours was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement with anterior temporal and EKG electrode. No activating procedures were performed. Wakefulness and sleep stage I and stage II and stage III were recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  A1 and A2 continuous electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to posterior dominant rhythm of at best 7 hertz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening. Sleep architecture is seen best over the left hemisphere. There is some asymmetry in the frontocentral beta seen best over the left hemisphere. No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
There is right central temporal slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts seen continuously with an associated loss of faster frequencies.
Generalized slow waves of 5-7 Hz seen continuously.
SEIZURES:  No episodes of seizures were reported.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right frontocentral focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG reveals evidence of frontocentral cerebral dysfunction which is consistent with the known stroke. In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
