INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE NOTE
Routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrode as well as anterior temporal
electrodes. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. Sleep recording was performed.
MEDICATIONS:
No seizure medications.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
Increased muscle artifact.
HISTORY:
This 56-year-old woman with a family history of seizures, who presents with several episodes of syncope with loss of
consciousness, dizziness, and migraine headaches.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The record opens up to low-amplitude recording with fronto-central muscle artifact at times a 9 to 1 0 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm can be seen, which is reactive to eye opening and eye closing with a small amplitude of 20 to 30 microvolts. Some
frontal central beta seen. No sleep activity is noted in the recording. No abnormal discharges were noted during
hyperventilation. Interestingly, there is some photic driving seen specifically at 11 Hz during photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE:
None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Normal awake EEG. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note that a repeated record with sleep may
increase the yield of capturing epileptiform abnormalities.
