CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old male with dementia and COPD.  The patient had a slip-and-fall injury with head trauma and left-sided shaking.  He was found to have a right parietal hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Pantoprazole, Advair, Insulin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is abnormal.  The left hemisphere is somewhat slow with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of alpha frequency activity.  There is a focus of delta in the right central region with generous spread.  As the recording continues, a periodic complex is identified at C4.  It is sometimes polyphasic.  It does not evolve.  Tactile stimulation of the patient as well as auditory stimulation of the patient produce an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A periodic complex with sharp waves and even some polyphasic sharp waves identified in the right hemisphere, maximum in the central and parietal region.
Focal slowing from the right.
Mild generalized slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports an irritative process but no seizures were recorded.  These findings were reported to the clinical team.
