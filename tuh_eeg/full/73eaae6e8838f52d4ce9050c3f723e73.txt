CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 46-year-old female with seizure on October 8th.  History of COPD, hypertension, and emotional illness.  Patient amnestic for seizure.  Past history of syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Symbicort, Gabapentin, Ambien, Enalapril, Spiriva, Norvasc, Celexa, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is a routine 20-minute EEG, which was a technically satisfactory despite a fair amount of muscle artifact in a 10th adult individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is acceptably organized with a 12 hertz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  In stage 2 sleep, spindles and posts were noted.
Photic stimulation did not significantly alter the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
