CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old female with history of recurrent meningioma with resection by temporal craniotomy, as well as Gamma Knife with subsequent seizures, history of hypertension, stroke, abdominal pain, with a recent seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Phenobarbital, Zosyn, Flagyl, Zofran, Coreg, Protonix, Aspirin, Sertraline, Sensamide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz.  It is best seen over the right hemisphere.  There is an increased amount of frontal central beta seen over the left hemisphere, as well as some swelling of the posterior dominant rhythm of the left hemisphere.  No activating procedures were performed.  Some stage I sleep is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES::  Left hemispheric slowing at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV maximally seen at times at T3.  In addition, there is an associated breech in the left hemisphere, seeing more in the central region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left hemispheric slowing, maximally in the mid temporal region without associated breech.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere which is consistent with the known surgery and tumor.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
