CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient was noted to have a recent stroke end missed dialysis.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown, Ativan.
Bedside video EEG was performed Using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was initially very uncooperative and was not possible to achieve Impedances below 5 kilohms in all regions.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG begins with an older adult with repetitive head bobbing and poor unresponsiveness. The EEG demonstrates initially a pattern of continuous triphasic waves and muscle twitch artifact. There is, however, some asymmetry noted In the background and In some montages, the triphasic waves have a bit more of a posterior predominance or even some shifting asymmetry. They may be more prominent on the left or right. There Is also a notched component in the right parietal region for some of the triphasic waves. Not all waveforms have exactly identical morphologies and some seem to stall posteriorly and spread anteriorly.

Ativan was administered. Which produced a marked reduction In the patients head bobbing and rapidly eliminated the triphasic wave form.

At the close of the record, the patient was drowsy and the overall pattern was one of a low voltage slow pattern with generous beta, particularly In the frontal and central regions. AS the activity fades with Ativan, there is focality in the discharges. Including left frontal and right parietal.
Heart rate Irregular at80 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION: This is a technically challenging but an unusual EEG but R demonstrates:
1. A pattern of periodic complexes, which do not have a completes all characteristics typical of a metabolic encephalopathy, Which resolved with Ativan.
3. Some focal sharp waves in this record, Including left frontal and right parietal

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were discussed with the clinical team and pharmacotherapy was initiated.
