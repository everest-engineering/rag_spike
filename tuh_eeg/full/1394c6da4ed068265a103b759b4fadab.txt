CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Adderall, Xanax, Zoloft, Depakote, and phenobarbital load.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and sleep record in a drowsy and somewhat irritable patient.  The patient had a scalp abrasion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the record includes stage 2 sleep.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex wave, K-complexes, spindles and posts.  The patient can be stimulated for hyperventilation which produces an alerting response with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage 2 sleep and did not activate the record.
Heart rate: 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal sleep EEG with very limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The use of benzodiazepines and barbiturates may account for the hypersomnolence.
