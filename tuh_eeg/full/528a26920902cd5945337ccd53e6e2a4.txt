History:	55 year old woman with a history of bilateral strokes and focal right facial seizures.
Seizure frequency recently has increased.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
Subtle left midtemporal and frontocentral occasional polymorphic theta activity is captured.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left, midtemporal and frontocentral
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal awake and briefly asleep EEG due to subtle occasional mild left midtemporal/
frontocentral focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin and is consistent with patient's history of a
prior stroke in the left MCA territory.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
