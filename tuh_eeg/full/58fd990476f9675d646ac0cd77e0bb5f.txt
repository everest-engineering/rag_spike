CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an adult male found down, normotensive, normothermic, on unknown date; no response to Narcan.
MEDICATIONS:  Folic Acid, Thiamine, Pantoprazole, Moxifloxacin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record in an intubated patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is a diffuse 7-Hz theta pattern.  There is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm.  There are rare bursts of shifting delta.  In addition, there are rare sections of the record when there seems to be an asymmetry with faster frequency activity, more attenuated on the right.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal alpha background with 7-Hz theta.
Shifting delta.
Occasional asymmetry with faster frequencies on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generalized background slowing is a nonspecific pattern.  It can be due to encephalopathy of many different causes or postictal state.  The shifting delta and the minor asymmetries described above can be correlated with imaging.  No sharp waves were seen, and no seizures were recorded.
