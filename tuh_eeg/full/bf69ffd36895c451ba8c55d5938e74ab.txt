CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old woman with post concussive headaches after head trauma in April 2013.  Left-sided pain.

MEDICATIONS:  Advil.

INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.

Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.

Heart rate 90 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Of note, there is no specific EEG pattern of post concussive headache.
