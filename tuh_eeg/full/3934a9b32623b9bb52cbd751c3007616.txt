CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84-year-old woman with cerebral atrophy, ventriculomegaly and breast cancer status post chemotherapy, now with a change in mental status and left subcortical infarct.

MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, hydralazine, lisinopril, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was  not possible, but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized.  At times the alpha rhythm reaches 8 Hz, but there is some 6-7 Hz activity noted with this as well.  Shifting slowing was noted.  Other features of drowsiness include a more hypersynchronous pattern and overall slowing of the background.  A rare, left central parietal sharp wave was noted.

Photic stimulation was initiated when the patient was quite drowsy, but the patient was alert and no photic driving response was noted.

The patient was tested to make sure that she was maximally awake and was able to answer questions appropriately.

Heart rate:  78 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left central parietal sharp waves noted at C3 and P3 on rare occasions as the patient was transitioning in and out of sleep.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Background disorganization.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The sharp waves are ipsilateral to the stroke.  The shifting slowing may be part of a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.
