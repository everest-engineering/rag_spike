CLINICAL HISTORY:  22-year-old male status post assault with 5 minute loss of consciousness.  Patient then had 2 episodes of dizziness with syncope.  History of bipolar disease, drug abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, morphine, Ativan, Percocet, Trileptal, doxepin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record  in a very drowsy individual.  It is a routine 20 minute study, technically acceptable, with all impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage with generous beta.  There is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm with a beta pattern and POSTS.  Brief stage 2 sleep with spindle was noted.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
HEART RATE:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Excess beta.
Mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are compatible with this patient's medications.  No epileptiform features were noted.
