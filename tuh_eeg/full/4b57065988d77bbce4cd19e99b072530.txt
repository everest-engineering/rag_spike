History:	38 year old woman undergoing right cerebral aneurysm coiling.  Total 8 coils were
deployed during the procedure
Medications:	Propofol, fentanyl, isoflurane, mannitol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Patient is awake at the beginning of the recording.  The background consists of diffuse fast activity.
Induction starts ~ 9 minutes into the recording.  There is diffuse burst suppression ~ 13 minutes into
the recording induced by the medications.  The background gradually recovers and for the rest of
the recording consists of a mixture of polymorphic alpha, theta and delta activity.  Periods of
discontinuity appear intermittently throughout the recording.  This is related to changes in
anesthetic medications used.  Total 8 coils are deployed but EEG technologist is notified only of 3
of them.  There is no change in the background related to coil deployment.
Sudden onset of very transient (~16 seconds) diffuse delta activity is observed ~ 1 hr 49 minutes
into the recording.  Etiology of this change is not clear.
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is 2 hour 27 minute continuous EEG recording performed during aneurysmal coiling.  EEG
remained symmetrical throughout, with no changes noted during the coil deployment (EEG
technologist was notified of 3 out of 8 coils). Brief (~ 16 second) increase in diffuse delta activity
occurred ~ 1 hr 49 minutes into the recording.  Significance of this change is not certain given its
brief duration: it could be related to changes in anesthetic medications used or it  could be related
to transient increase in ICP.  This change was noted during the procedure but the Attending
physician was notified of the change after the procedure given rapid recovery of EEG to its
