CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman with daily episodes for the past 2 years characterized by freezing, head jerking back and forth mostly to the left, difficulty breathing, gasping respirations.  Events last 10 seconds to 2 minutes and sometimes occur in clusters.  Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in 2000.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was completed.  This was a 26 minute EEG which was primarily in wakefulness.  The patient had 6 clinical events during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG was well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  A total of 6 behavioral events were noted including 1 at the start of the EEG.  The patient rocks her head from side to side.  On one occasion she gasps and on another occasion, she put her hands to her throat.
All events were characterized by head rocking artifact.  No epileptiform features were identified before, during or after the event.  Immediately after the event, the EEG demonstrated an awake pattern.  The patient demonstrated psychomotor slowing, sometimes unable to answer questions, sometimes unresponsive.  On other occasions, she followed commands but was unable to speak or demonstrated psychomotor slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited brief driving.  The patient also had one of her spells during photic stimulation.  Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
Multiple behavioral events with head rocking but without an epileptiform signature.
A normal awake pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  The video and clinical correlates as well as the normal EEG during these events with unresponsiveness are more suggestive of a non-epileptiform behavior.
