CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old male with profound mental retardation, previously seizure free, but with recent breakthrough seizure. The characteristics of the recent seizure are unknown.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Ativan, Seroquel
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient has great difficulty cooperating with the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a pattern of diffuse beta. Brief drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in overall movement and increase in cooperativeness.
HR: 114 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with diffuse beta pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed, but this beta pattern does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and is the same pattern as previously described.
