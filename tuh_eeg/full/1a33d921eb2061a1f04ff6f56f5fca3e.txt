Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
There is intermittent focal theta slowing over the right centrotemporal region (C4-T4).  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces no photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21 minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep due to intermittent focal slowing
over the right centrotemporal region. Focal slowing suggests a structural brain lesion.  No clinical
or electrographic seizures are present.
