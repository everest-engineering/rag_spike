FOR OVER 1 YR THEN HAD MILD SZ 1 MNTH AGO DEJA VU THEN WENT TO
SLEEP.  HAD BIG SZ WK AGO DEJA VU GTC/LOC TONGUE BITE WITH POST
ICTAL CONF.  PT STATES THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED 1 OTHER TIME.
Medications:	TRILEPTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal  region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
