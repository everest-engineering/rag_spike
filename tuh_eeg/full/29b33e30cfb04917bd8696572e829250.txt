INTRODUCTION: Routine EEG using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes as well as anterior temporal
electrode was performed. Photic stimulation was also performed but no hyperventilation. Sleep is characterized by stage I
and II.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin and phenobarbital.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: None.
HISTORY: A 48-year-old male With history of seizures presents after being found outside of ER after being discharged was seen
previously for seizures and being subtherapeutic on phenobarbital.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: When the patient 1s awake, there is posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz with amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts and
moderate to large amount of frontal central beta. The patient usually falls asleep and goes into stage I and II sleep. The
patient has no abnormal discharges to photic stimulation. No hyperventilation was performed. The heart rate is 90.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  1. Continuous focal slow waves seen at F8/T 4 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.
2. Sharp waves are seen with shifting negativity at FP1/FP2 which occur frequently during the recording.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG, awake and sleep due to continuous right anterior temporal slowing and frequent pre-frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the pre-frontal
region. In addition, there is evidence of continued structural focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region,
which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region. No seizures were seen.
