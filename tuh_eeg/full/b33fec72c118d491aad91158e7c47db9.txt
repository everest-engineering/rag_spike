CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male present with seizures with post ictal.

MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Phenytoin, Keppra, Simvastatin, Levothyroxine, Zonisamide, Keppra

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is a drowsy record in a post-ictal patient.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall pattern is one of slow delta. There is more arrhythmic delta activity on the right compared to the left but unfortunately more muscle on the left compared to the right. In the beginning of this sharply contoured record, there is a suggestion of a left anterior temporal sharp wave. There is also what seems to be some vertex sharp activity seen a little bit first on the right and then on the left. The majority of the sharp waves are in the right hemisphere and include T4, T 4 with a posterior temporal field of spread, CZ-C4 or C4, T4. There are a handful which are also picked up on the left including T3 and then F7, T3. There are also some that seem to start at C3 and end up in the left central parietal region. While the patient is more awake as the EEG continues, the epileptiform activity is partially obscured. This EEG also demonstrates spread of the sharp waves to adjacent areas of the brain.

HR: 105 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked slowing of the background with replacement of normal background with a delta-theta pattern.
2. Epileptiform activity from both hemispheres with a generous field of spread including right temporal, right central and left anterior temporal.
3. Central sharp waves which seem to be more prominent right central temporal rather than actual CZ focus.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly irritative process and a multifocal process for his epilepsy.
