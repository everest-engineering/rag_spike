CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed woman with history of syncope and loss of consciousness with confusion afterwards.

MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Lorazepam, Valium.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope versus seizure.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a mildly excessive amount of frontal central beta seen diffusely.  The patient reaches stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing seen rarely at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 mV.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
