CLINICAL HISTORY:   25 year old right handed woman with anxiety, depression, remote history of substance abuse, possible seizure characterized by loss of consciousness, shaking, confusion, panic disorder with anxiety and major depression, migraine headaches.  Past history of exposure to heroine and cocaine.  Seizures described as "clinching up, laughing real evil", rolling towards her fianc√© and then shaking for 2 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Abilify, Lexapro, Suboxone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta. Hyperventilation produces an abundant rhythmic background slowing.  Mu activity is noted.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in amplitude of the background in a hypersynchronous rhythmic pattern. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving with subharmonic, harmonic and supraharmonic driving response.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is no epileptiform features identified.  This EEG demonstrated multiple, youthful patterns, including hypnagogic hypersynchronous in the transition to sleep.  There were no epileptiform features noted.
