History:	43 YR MALE S/P ROBOTIC MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT 12/12.  PT
AGITATED, DELIRIUM AT TIMES. PMHX: HTN, AFIB, ESRD.
Medications:	SEROQUEL, DARBEPOETIN, DILAUDID
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Technically difficult due to muscle artifact. No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background
activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR: 102
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, bilateral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Consider repeating
the study when cooperative.
