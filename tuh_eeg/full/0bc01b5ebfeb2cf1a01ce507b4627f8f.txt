CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old right handed male with an ascending aortic aneurysm with past medical history of hypertension, emphysema and positive urine drug screen for cocaine.
MEDICATIONS:  Bactroban, Metoprolol, Protonix, Heparin, Thiamine, Folic Acid, Serax, Percocet
REASON FOR STUDY:  Pre-op.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  Patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL: DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness only.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and independently at F8/T4, both at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in bilateral anterior temporal regions, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
