History:	47 year old woman with a history of SAH with subsequent seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Dilantin, Versed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~6.5 hours on 4/30/2015.   Nursing-initiated event
buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.    Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice
daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically
detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of attenuated polymorphic
theta and delta activity admitted with diffuse sleep-spindle-like waveforms and periods of
discontinuity.  Additional continuous polymorphic delta activity and underriding fast frequencies
are noted over the left anterior quadrant.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left anterior
Breach artifact, left anterior
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal ~6.5 hours continuous video EEG due to moderate to severe diffuse
slowing and continuous left anterior quadrant focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, based on
the waveforms seen, it is at least partially related to the medication effect.  Continuous focal
slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left anterior quadrant.  Breach artifact is
secondary to a skull defect.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
