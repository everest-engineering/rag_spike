CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old.
MEDICATIONS:  phenobarbital, Keppra, Tegretol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm noted.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
In maximal wakefulness, there is an asymmetry with relative attenuation of activity in the left hemisphere, particularly the left temporal regions relative to the right, although posterior dominant rhythm can be identified.
Heart rate 60-90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically, somewhat challenging EEG, but is remarkable for attenuation of faster frequencies in the left hemisphere, primarily in wakefulness.
