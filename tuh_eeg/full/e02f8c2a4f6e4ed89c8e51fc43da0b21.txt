CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed female with history of seizures. Patient states she had seizure like episode during sleep on 4/14/2010. She woke up tired and with a headache and confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Prozac.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 40-60 microvolts with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed; however, a normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing sleep is suggested.
