CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old woman with HIV disease, recent biopsy for cerebritis.  Temporal and vertex headache.  The patient is aware of left-sided weakness, left homonymous hemianopia, but not aware of any seizures or visual phenomenon
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Lexapro, Keppra, oxycodone, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was coherent and communicative throughout the entire EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry.  The left hemisphere demonstrates generous beta with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a breach rhythm with higher amplitude activity in the right occipital region and focal slowing.  There is rhythmic 5 to 6 Hz theta frequency activity noted in that region.  On 2 occasions, there is waxing and waning, with some frequency evolution of that activity.  Both bursts are approximately 1 minute in duration.  These occur at 11:49 and 11:54.  In contrast to previous EEG, there is not a pattern of acceptable spiking.  There is, however, more well defined end to the waxing and waning activity.  No clinical signs or symptoms were associated with this.  The right hemisphere also demonstrates generous beta.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for harmonic and supraharmonic driving, as well as an accentuation in the region of the breach.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right occipital region.
Paroxysmal activity in the right occipital region with at least on 2 occasions, frequency evolution.
Breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background activity from the right occipital region is markedly abnormal.  At least on 2 occasions, there is some evolution and these 2 discharges may be subclinical seizures.
