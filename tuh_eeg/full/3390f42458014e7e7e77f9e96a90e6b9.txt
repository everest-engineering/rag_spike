CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old left handed male with onset epilepsy initially attributed to alcohol abuse, subsequently attributed to stroke with an abnormal MRI, suggesting focal encephalitis.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in Jab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. There is a scant amount of frontal theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Around the time of photic stimulation there is a subtle asymmetry with a slightly more left frontal theta compared to the right.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very subtle left frontal temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features have been identified in this EEG or in any of the previous EEGs. These EEGs include 2 studies dating back to 2005, as well as earlier studies this year.
