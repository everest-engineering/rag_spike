AGE : 83 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 12/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : outpatient EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake only EEG # :. 15-1818
HISTORY :
83 y .o . female with a history of vascular dementia and pituitary adenoma s/p surgery and radiation therapy referred for routine EEG for evaluation of memory problems .
MEDICATIONS , per Epic :

SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) .
Drowsiness and sleep are not captured. There is mild generalized slowing.
There is frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing.
There is occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes .
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
This is an abnormal awake only routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization
Frequent left temporal polymorphic slowing
Occasional independent right temporal polymorphic slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of left greater than right temporal dysfunction superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was
not recorded.	If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
