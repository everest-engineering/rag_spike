History:	46 year old woman with a history of seizures since 17 year old.
Medications:	Depakote, Seroquel, Zoloft, Albuterol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Excess beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect,
such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
