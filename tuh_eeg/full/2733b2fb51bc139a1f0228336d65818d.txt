REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old man with a history of HIV and hypertension status post with 3 seizures transferred from Frankfort to rule out status with an EEG now for follow up.
MEDICATIONS:  Truvada, Keppra, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake and confused.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reached 7 Hz and very infrequent central beta seen.  The overall recording is mainly a diffuse theta rhythm that at times has superimposed frontal delta and some waveforms that appear slightly triphasic in morphology.
No normal sleep is captured.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Moderate generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.  At times these waveforms have slight frontal delta frequency and some of them appears to have a slight triphasic morphology very infrequently.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
