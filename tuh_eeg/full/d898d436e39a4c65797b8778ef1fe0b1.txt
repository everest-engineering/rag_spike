CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed female with history of diabetes, anxiety, depression, restless leg syndrome, headache, with EEG for follow up.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Losartan, Fenofibrate, Amlodipine, Ranitidine, Aspirin, Pravastatin, Pramipexole, Pregabalin, Trazodone, Clonazepam, Flonase, Zolpidem, Coreg, Prozac
REASON FOR STUDY:  Follow up for abnormal EEG..
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excess amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen occasionally throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left temporal region , which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
