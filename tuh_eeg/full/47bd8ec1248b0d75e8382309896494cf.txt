History:	45 YR MALE CC SOB/FEVER/ TACHYCARDIA. IN ED BECAME HYPOXIC/ SOMNOLENT.  INTUBATED,  SEPSIS S/P SURGERY FOR RECTAL ABSCESS WITH MSSA BACTEREMIA, S/P BRONCH.
Medications:	LORAZEPAM DRIP (2 MG HR), FENTANYL DRIP 100 MCG HR
Sedation:	Lorazepam
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description: Background is characterized by a diffusely slow, attenuated, and poorly reactive pattern. No posterior dominant rhythm is present.  Bursts of diffuse theta activity are present.  Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present diffusely with a maximal negativity in the bilateral fronto temporal regions, with a slight asymmetry with a higher amplitude seen in the left fronto temporal regions. No normal sleep architecture is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Tactile and painful stimulation produce an increase in muscle artifact without a clear change in background activity.  HR is 84.
Summary of Findings: Interhemispheric asynchrony, intermittent, bilateral frontotemporal, right mildly attenuated.
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL EEG in a sedated and intubated patient because of diffuse background slowing and absence of a posterior dominant rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. There is also  an asymmetry in the voltage of the intermittent bifrontal discharge with a lower amplitude on the right fronto-temporal region.  This finding may be indicative of focal cortical cerebral dysfunction on the right or alternatively it may be suggestive  of a fluid collection over that region. No electrographic seizures are present.
