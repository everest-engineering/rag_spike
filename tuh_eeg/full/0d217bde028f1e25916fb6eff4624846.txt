CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right handed woman with post stroke epilepsy, recurrent stroke in May of 2010, currently seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Insulin, Gleevec, Darbepoetin, Aspirin; Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, Imatinib, Nifedipine, Darbepoetin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized with an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of background theta. Some shifting slowing is observed. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 84bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the interval infarct, this EEG is less disorganized than her previous study. No epileptiform features were identified in either EEG.
