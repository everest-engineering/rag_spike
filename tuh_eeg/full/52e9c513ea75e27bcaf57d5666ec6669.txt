History:	67 YR MALE WITH  CC OF ASPIRATION  PNEUMONIA, NEURO CONSULTED FOR
CHANGE IN MS. PT WAS GETTING ANTIBIOTICS. POSSIBLE METABOLIC
DERANGEMENTS.  STILL DROWSY AND NOT FOLLOW COMMANDS.
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN, UNASYN, AMLODIPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The waking background consists of a 25-40uV, 8Hz symmetric alpha rhythm which attenuates on
eye opening.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent, independent bilateral midtemporal focal slowing was present.  At times, the left
midtemporal focal slowing is sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and intermittent bilateral
midtemporal focal slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse and focal cerebral dysfunction.
