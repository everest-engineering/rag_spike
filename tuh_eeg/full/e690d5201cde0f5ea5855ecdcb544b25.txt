CLINICAL HISTORY:  17 year old with possible seizure activity as a child, unevaluated in childhood, now with episodes of lightheadedness followed by loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient refused hyperventilation.  Photic simulation performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 60 microvolt alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Central mu rhythm is identified but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Features of sleep include vertex waves, posts and spindles.   Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 	100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL  CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified.  The resting heart rate is somewhat elevated and may merit additional evaluation.
