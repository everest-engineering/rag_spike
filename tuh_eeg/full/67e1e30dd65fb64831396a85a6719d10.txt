CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old left woman with fainting spells in pregnancy.  Past history of recurrent syncope and dizziness, family history of syncope.

MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed, but no hyperventilation.  This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of voltage frontocentral beta activity.  In stage 2 sleep vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts were noted.  Stage 2 sleep is essentially symmetric.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was asleep.  Scant driving was identified.

HR:    104 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If this individual continues to have frequent events, a follow-up study capturing deeper states of sleep may be considered.
