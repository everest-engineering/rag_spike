CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old left handed male with syncope, evaluate for seizures.
This is a 64-year-old male who has episodes where he loses time, has an out of body
sensation, may have feelings of anger.

MEDICATIONS: Blood pressure medicines.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a HZ posterior dominant
rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an increasing
amplitude of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the
alpha rhythm with vertex waves noted in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation is performed
while the patient is drifting off to sleep but does elicit a subtle driving response.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. However,
if epilepsy is an important consideration, please consider a followup, sleep-deprived
study capturing deeper stages of sleep.
