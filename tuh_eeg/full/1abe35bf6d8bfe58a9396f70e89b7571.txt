CLINICAL HISTORY: 83 year old right handed gentleman with left-sided shaking which was followed by generalized motor activity without loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: None listed in chart
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of temporal theta, right greater than left. Benign epileptiform transients of sleep can be noted in the transition to stage II sleep and are seen on rare occasions from the right or left. Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves and spindles. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient emerges from stage II sleep and produces a small amount of driving.
HR: 78 bpm, and irregular
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a little bit more right than left temporal theta there are a normal finding. If additional information is needed in a prolonged study in search of epileptiform activity is suggested.
