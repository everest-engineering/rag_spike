History: year old man with a history of head trauma and seizures.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The background consists of low voltage 10-11 Hz alpha posteriorly with expected AP gradient.
Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Symmetrical K-complexes are captured.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the  right midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Additionally, faster frequencies at higher amplitudes are
presents over the bilateral frontocentral regions (breach).  Very focal T4/C4 sharp waves are
captured.  During sleep they increase in frequency and become frequent.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid, mild-to-moderate
Breach artifact, bilateral, frontocentral
Sharp waves, frequent, right, midtemporal/ central, seen during sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22 minute EEG due to continuous mild-to-moderate right
midtemporal focal slowing and very focal right midtemporal/ central epileptiform discharges that
increase in frequency during sleep. These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic
focal structural lesion in the right midtemporal/ central region.  Breach artifact is secondary to the
underlying skull defect.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
