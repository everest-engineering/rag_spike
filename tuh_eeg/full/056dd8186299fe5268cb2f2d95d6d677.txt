CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 67-year-old woman with 19-year history of epilepsy, increasing seizures now 3 per month.  Seizures with loss of consciousness, incontinent, and confusion.  Also, tremor.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine, 22-minute outpatient digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically acceptable EEG with impedances below 5 kilohms.  The patient was observed to have a constant body tremor.  The tremor produce some artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  As the patient became drowsy, there were rare bursts of shifting slowing noted.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, discernable underneath the 5 Hz artifact.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No significant focal or epileptiform features were identified for this individual.  The rare bursts of shifting slowing are acceptable for an adult of this age.  Of note, the patient has tremor in sleep suggesting that a more prolonged sleep record may not be helpful in identifying epileptiform activity.
