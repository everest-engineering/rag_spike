CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, phenobarbital, Vimpat.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures/status epilepticus.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours from 08/29/2013-08/30/2013 using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz, which appears to be best seen over the right hemisphere.  Mainly there is diffuse slowing in the delta theta range at 2-4 Hz, an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts with some intermixed theta at 5-7 microvolts.  There appears to be some reactivity and variability to the EEG.
Seizures:  None.
Abnormal discharges:  Mild to moderate generalized slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate generalized slowing.
Heart rate: 90.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen in this 24 hour recording.
