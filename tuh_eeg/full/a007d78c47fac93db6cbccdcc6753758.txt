CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old left handed male with an episode on August 28 when he was talking to his wife, had right leg shaking, confusion, eyes rolling back and then incontinence. Patient amnestic for event.
MEDICATIONS:  Acai Berry Extract, Calcium, Vitamin D3 Melatonin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta followed by POSTS and brief vertex waves. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation but lambda waves and driving are noted.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing different stages of sleep is suggested.
