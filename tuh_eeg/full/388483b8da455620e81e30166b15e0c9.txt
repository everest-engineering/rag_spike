Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Left sided injection at 9:19AM with an

Right sided injection at 10:08AM with an EEG change consisting of right hemisphere focal slowing.
By 10:30AM the EEG returns to baseline.  HR was 66.
