CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed gentleman status post multiple head
traumas including left parietal injury with impaired memory and dysesthesias on the
right hemibody.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Enalapril, Omeprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz, 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. In the transition to drowsiness, there is a small degree of
shifting slowing. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces an
increase in amplitude in the background. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
beta and a small degree of shifting slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving
response.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. A scant degree of shifting slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Identical features were noted in the previous study
3/20/2009, with a small degree of shifting slowing or disorganization noted again just in
the early part of the record. No epileptiform features were observed in either of these
records. As this patient is continuing to have paroxysmal tingling on the left hemibody,
a repeat study capturing one of his spells is advised.
