CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 39-year-old right-handed woman with multiple sclerosis, traveling by wheelchair.  Patient describes Ativan withdrawal related seizures July 2014, none since.
MEDICATIONS:  Avonex.
INTRODUCTION:  20 minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement.  The EKG channel was not operative.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  The overall background is abnormal.  There is excess, diffuse rhythmic theta noted.  In addition, there are some bursts of shifting slowing noted from the right or left hemisphere as well as occasional bursts of generalized, a bit more frontally predominant, rhythmic mixed theta delta.
Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation significantly activate the record.
Brief drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Excess background theta.
Disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
Occasional bursts of rhythmic by hemispheric slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The features described above are nonspecific and support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  There were no epileptiform features noted.
