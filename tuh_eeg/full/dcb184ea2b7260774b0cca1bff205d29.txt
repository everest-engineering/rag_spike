CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman with prior evaluation for non-epileptic seizures.  Patient has had multiple medical problems within the past year and now presents for reevaluation of intermittent repetitive stiffening and motor behavior.  The patient is now a resident of a nursing home with a feeding tube and amputation.  She is status post cardiac surgery 06/27/2012.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Technical issues in this EEG include excess muscle artifact.  The patient has limited ability to cooperate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The waking background is a bit variable.  At times, there is a 7-9 Hz alpha rhythm but at other times there is more of a diffuse theta pattern.  A fair amount of muscle artifact is noted as is tremor artifact and frequent blinking.
Otic stimulation did not activate the record.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Excess background theta.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has multiple normal EEGs, including 06/25/2012.  She had an EEG with background slowing in January 2013.  None of her EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity.  While the earlier EEGs were all normal, this EEG is slower than the previous studies but is improved compared to January 2013.
Please call the lab at 215-707-4523 if you need copies of her previous EEG recordings or EEG monitoring.
