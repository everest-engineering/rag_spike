History:	68 year man with a history of TBI and subsequent seizure x2.
Medications:	Dilantin, Klonopin, Aspirin, Buspar, Lexapro
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a polymorphic 25-40uV, 9-9.5Hz alpha rhythm.  It is better
formed over the left.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient that is better
formed over the left.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  There is subtle asymmetry in
sleep architecture over the right temporal region
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity with paucity of faster frequencies are noted over
the right hemisphere, especially over the lateral leads.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, mild-to-moderate, especially over the
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 25-minute awake and asleep EEG due to continuous focal right hemispheric
slowing that is most pronounced over the temporal region. This finding is indicative of a focal
cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
