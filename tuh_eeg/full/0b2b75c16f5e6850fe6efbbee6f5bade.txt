REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures, change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during awake. Activating procedures were not performed.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lasix, Norvasc, Coreg.
HISTORY:  A 75-year-old woman with past medical history of hypertension,  diabetes, hyperlipidemia, AFib, peripheral vascular disease, alcohol abuse. CT with right posterior parietal hyperdensity possible cavernoma admitted for a change in mental status.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is a lot of muscle movement artifact throughout the entire recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse theta slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7.5 Hz which appears to be more reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta, but again this EEG is limited by movement.  The patient is only recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures are not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild-to-moderate generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen in wakefulness.
Heart rate is irregular and at a rate of 102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild-to-moderate generalized slowing. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
