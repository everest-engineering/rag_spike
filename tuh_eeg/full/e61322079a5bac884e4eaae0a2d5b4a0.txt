REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69 -year-old male with history of seizures for his entire life as per description of them.   He has had a previous quadruple bypass, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and amputation of the right leg below the knee but surgeries on both legs.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Aricept, Uroxatral, Lipitor, Lexapro, Zetia, atenolol, aspirin, Zantac, zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep stage I.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation. No abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen rare to occasionally at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  At one point, there is a burst that becomes slightly monomorphic  but not clearly.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right anterotemporal focal slowing.
Heart rate:  60.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
