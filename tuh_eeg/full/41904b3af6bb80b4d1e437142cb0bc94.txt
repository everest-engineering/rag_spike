History:	73 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SZ.  SHAKING  WITH URINARY INCONT AND
TONGUE BITE.  X 5MIN. WITH LEFT GAZE PREFER. POST ICTAL 15-20 MIN.

REPAIR 7/13, HTN, HLD, PULMONARY NODULE.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent independent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anteriotemporal
region (left more than right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving from 1to 5 Hz.  HR 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of independent polymorphic delta
activity in the bilateral anteriotemporal region (left more than right).  This finding is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
