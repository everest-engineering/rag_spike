History:	77 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF PARKINSON'S, RIGHT CVA SUBCORTICAL. HTN,
COLON CA.  NOW WITH CHANGE IN MS.  STOPPED EATING AND TALKING,
DRINKING  X3 DYS.
Medications:	Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of
100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 54
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing and
FIRDA.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
