CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since 2002, last
seizure was 8 months ago with bilateral hand tremulousness with no recall of events.
History of pancreatitis and heart disease. Seizures are characterized by lack of
awareness, bizarre behavior, head banging and "ingestion of soap."
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well-organized 9.3 Hz, 50
microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral
beta activity. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and
an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response at faster flash
frequencies.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG in the Temple database.
A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis. If this individual continues to have
frequent events, capturing an EEG with an in-or outpatient monitoring system may be
beneficial.
