CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old female with a history of recurrent seizures with postictal
confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Klonopin, Lamotrigine, Zonisamide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appears to have some behavioral
issues and has an aid assisting her. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is slow.
When the patient is crying, the alpha rhythm reaches 8 Hz but the remainder of the time it is significantly slower. There are some paroxysmal bursts of frontally predominant 4 Hz activity which are notched compatible with a subtle underlying sharp wave. Some of these occur in isolation and, again, are quite subtle. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. There is an Intermittent increase in frontal beta without clear change in the patient's mental status. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record .

HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow and disorganized background for an adult of this age.
2. Frontally predominant paroxysmal theta which Is notched and appears to have a sharp
wave associated with it but not with the characteristic spike and slow wave activity of a
primary generalized epilepsy.
3. A handful of isolated right or left frontocentral sharp waves.
4. Occasional paroxysmal beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function affecting gray and white matter. A secondarily generalized mechanism for epilepsy may be considered. The history provided is quite limited and it is possible that there is a more significant neurologic history, not provided today.
