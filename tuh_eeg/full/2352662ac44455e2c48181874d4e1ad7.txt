History: 57 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P PEA CODE ON 1/14/15 APPROX 10 MIN. PT WAS HAVING A ERCP PRIOR TO CODE. PMHX SIG FOR ETOH ABUSE/POLYSUBSTANCE, CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, CROHN DIS, HTN, HLD. FOLLOW UP EEG FOR NEURO EVAL
Medications:	DOPAMINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  Occasional low amplitude focal sharp waves are present in the T3 region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no clear reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. There is variability.  HR was 120
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  occasional frequent epileptiform discharges in the left midtemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition there is severe  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
