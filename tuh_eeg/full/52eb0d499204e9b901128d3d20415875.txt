History:	75YO MALE WITH H/O SEIZURES NSET 15YRS AGO. LAST SZ 8YRS. AGO.
PMH: HTN
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess theta activity of 7Hz was seen.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG
with sleep recording may provide additional information.
