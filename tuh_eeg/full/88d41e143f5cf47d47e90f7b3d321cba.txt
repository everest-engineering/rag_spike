AGE: 23 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/04/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient EEG TYPE: 95819
EEG #: 15-1303
HISTORY:
23 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for SEIZURES SINCE AGE OF 12 .	MORE SEIZURES OCCURRING IN SLEEP AND DURING THE DAY AURA DIZZY POST ICTAL SLEEPS AFTER CONFUSED.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
Aripiprazole (ABILIFY) 2 mg tablet, Take 2 mg by mouth daily. levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
citalopram (CELEXA) 20 mg tablet, Take 20 mg by mouth daily. alprazolam (XANAX) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth nightly as needed for Sleep.
amitriptyline (ELAVIL) 50 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth nightly.
Zolpidem (AMBIEN) 5 mg tablet, Take 5 mg by mouth nightly as needed.
topiramate (TOPAMAX) 100 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
No current facility-administered medications for this visit.
SEDATION: TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG , HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10.7 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : produces an increase in amplitude Photic Stimulation: elicited bilateral driving
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 66 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
