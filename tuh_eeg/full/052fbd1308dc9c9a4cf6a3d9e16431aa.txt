History:	37 YO MALE ARRIVE AT ED WITH HEADACHE. HAD GTC WHILE THERE
LASTING SEVERAL MIN, FOLLOWED BY CONFUSION, NOT FOLLOWING
COMMANDS, RIGHT ARM STIFFENING AND TWITCHING 10 -15 SEC
Medications:	HALDOL, ATIVAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal temporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is loss of faster frequencies in this region.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal midtemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal
in the temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In
addition  intermittent focal slowing in the right central region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. Lastly, there is  diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse
