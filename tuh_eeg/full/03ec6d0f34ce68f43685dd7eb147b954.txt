CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed male with a past medical history of
seizures. The patient has been seizure-free x3 years. He is status post frontal
craniotomy in 1996, for skull defect and also other past medical history is diabetes and
hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Lamotrigine, Ursodiol, Hydrocortisone, Levothyroxine,
Amlodipine, Furosemide, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG had on the right 8.5 Hz alpha
rhythm. The left side had a lower amplitude, breach rhythm was noticed, TIRDA was
seen. Sharps were noted in FS, T2. Photic stimulation produced a driving response.
Hyperventilation produced rhythmic high amplitude temporal activity with sharp wave.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left side had lower amplitude.
2. Right side had increased amplitude.
3. Breach rhythm was noted.
4. Sharp waves were noted in FS and T2 during hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There was occasional right temporal sharp wave and
hyperventilation gave a focal response supports focal mechanism for seizures.
