REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 71-year-old woman with history of seizure a year ago described fully whole-body shaking, now presents with 2 episodes of loss of consciousness with urinary incontinence.  Has a history of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, amlodipine, atorvastatin, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some intermittent electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in weakness and drowsiness.
Heart rate 56.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T3 and at times at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left midtemporal and anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal and midtemporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
