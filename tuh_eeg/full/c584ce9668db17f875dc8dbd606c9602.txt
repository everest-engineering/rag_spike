CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old male with episodes of memory relapse, 3 day memory lapse last week, right facial numbness.  Hit in the face with steal and now worsening memory.  Evaluate for non-epileptic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Ambien, Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, low-voltage, frontocentral data.  Mu activity was identified but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Muscle artifact was noted on the left.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic central theta.
There is a subtle abnormality noted with subtle, underlying, intermittent theta noted in the right central and temporal region.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very subtly and mildly abnormal EEG due to subtle focal slowing from the right central temporal region in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The subtle underlying sign may be correlated with imaging in this individual with a history of head trauma.  If seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged, outpatient EEG monitoring session may be of value.
