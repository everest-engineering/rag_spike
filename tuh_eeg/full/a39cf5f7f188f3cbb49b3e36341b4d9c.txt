History:	82 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF REPAIR OF AFFERENT LOOP PERFORATION (EPCP AND IATROGENIC BOWEL PERF. )/  S/P CODE 1/10/14 X 30 MIN.   NEURO EVAL.  HYPOXIC ENCEPH;
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN, PROTONIX, TIGECYCLINE, POLYMYXIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by absence of any electrical cerebral activity.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen. There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.  There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli.  This EEG was not performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 102  There was continuous ventilator artifact in the record.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of   absent alpha rhythm and electrocerebral silence. These findings, in the absence of sedatives or hypothermia, can be consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.  Please note that this EEG was not performed according the ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.
