History:	54 YO MALE.PMHX.KIDNEY TRANSPLANT 2008,CABG,R BKA,L BKA, DM. PT
BROUGHT TO EPISCOPAL AFTER WITNESSED COLLAPSE.PT. WAS ILL PRIOR
TO EVENT LOW BP UNRESPONSIVE FOLLOWED BY ASYSTOLE
Medications:	Heparin, Multiple pressors
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies
is not seen.  There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording.  There is no
spontaneous state change during the recording and no change with visual, auditory, or tactile
stimuli.  This EEG was performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical
Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 96 irregular with frequent PVCs  Some pulse artifact, EKG
artifact, respiration and ventilator tubing artifacts are seen throughout the record.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an isoelectric EEG performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of
electrocerebral inactivity.  This EEG is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.
