History:	62 YR FEMALE FOUND UNRESP ON FLOOR MOVING HER LEGS.  FOUND TO
HAVE RIGHT SAH/SDH AND LEFT MASTOID FX.  PT POSITIVE FOR COCAINE
ON ADM.  PMHX: COPD, HTN, INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGE S/P FALL 08.
DEPRESSION, ANXIETY.
Medications:	FENTANYL LAST NIGHT, LOVENOX, KEPPRA, FAMOTIDINE, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by at best a  25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.   5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is seen with an asymmetric amplitude
slightly higher on the left.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present maximal over the T4 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the T3 region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 120
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In
addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in
origin.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
