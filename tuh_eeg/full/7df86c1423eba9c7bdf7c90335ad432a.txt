CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old left handed woman with epilepsy, seizure free for
the past year but with a new complaint which was unclear for the past 4-6 weeks.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hertz 50 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. Both hyperventilation and drowsiness produce a small
amount of temporal theta. There is also some wicket noted. Features of additional
drowsiness include beta activity. Unusual eye artifact is noted. Photic stimulation
elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION; Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Given the unusual field of eye artifact. a repeat study with
more careful confirmation of electrode placement is advised.
