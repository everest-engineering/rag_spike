History:	78 Y/O FEMALE R HANDED. CAME IN TUESDAY TO REMOVE TUMOR FROM
LIVER. ENCEPHALOPATHY ? CHG. IN MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:	Heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse  delta
and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, continuous
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
