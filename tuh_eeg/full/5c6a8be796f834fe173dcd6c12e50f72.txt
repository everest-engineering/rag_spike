History:	42 YEAR OLD, RIGHT HANDED FEMALE. PMHX STROKE IN MARCH NOW WITH
SEIZURES
Medications:	AMBIEN, KEPPRA, OXYCODONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid and anterior temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 96.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, Mid and anterior temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left mid
and anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
