CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old woman with syncopal spell.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness include slowing of the alpha rhythm and temporal wicket.  Abundant stage 2 sleep included vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Hyper synchronous rhythmic slowing is noted, but no definitive sharp waves were seen.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Multiple normal variants were noted including wicket and Mu.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of value.
