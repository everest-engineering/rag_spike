Medications:	DEPAKOTE, LAMICTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal spike-and-wave, polyspike and wave discharges and
sharp waves are present in the left fronto-central region, with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at C3 and F3.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Spikes and sharp waves, frequent, left anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent large epileptiform discharges in the left fronto-
central region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region,
and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization-
related epilepsy. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
