CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman, who developed seizures after an MI, currently seizure free for 1 year.  Seizures characterized by trembling and slurred speech.  Patient usually has an aura, knows that she is going to blackout prior to the events.
MEDICATIONS:  Quinapril, carbamazepine, hydralazine, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is 11 hertz, 70-90 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Brief drowsiness was characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  EKG:  N/A.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform seizures were noted.  Unfortunately, the EKG lead was not working during this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be considered, but this is the 2nd normal EEG for this adult.
