Medications:	Vimpat, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  There is diffuse 7.5 Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of diffuse background slowing.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
