CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 45-year-old male with recurrent syncopal events.  Family history of epilepsy.  History of traumatic brain injury and incarceration.
MEDICATIONS:  none reported
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically challenging EEG due to impedance problems, but is easily interpretable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves and POSTS in stage 1 sleep.  Vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS are noted in stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study in the lab may be a value.
