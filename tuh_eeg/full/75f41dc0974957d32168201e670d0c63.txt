History:	67 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O HEADACHE W/ VOMITING, HA AT
TIMES LAST ALL DAY. ONSET ON LT SIDE OF HEAD THEN GEN ALONG WITH
BLURRED VISION/PHOTOPHOBIA, 1 EVENT OF LOC. HE FREQ OF 1-2 X A
WEEK. ALSO HAS C/C OF SOB AND LOSS OF MEMORY. PMHX SIG FOR ASTHMA
Medications:	AMARYL, METFORMIN, FOSAMAX, VICTOZA, XANAX, ZOLOFT, CLARITIN AND
OTHERS SEE CHART
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
Intermittent, independent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bitemporal regions, maximal
at T1 and T3.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to intermittent, independent bitemporal focal
slowing, greater on the left side. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in the
temporal region, which is etiologically non-specific.
