CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult with diabetes, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl, insulin, glipizide, Keppra, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  There are some technical issues for this EEG which have not been entirely resolved at the time of this dictation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are some bursts of relatively synchronous bilateral slowing.  In addition, there are rare bursts of rhythmic slowing identified in the right or left temporal region.  Photo stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific, but should be correlated with imaging.  No epileptiform features were identified.
