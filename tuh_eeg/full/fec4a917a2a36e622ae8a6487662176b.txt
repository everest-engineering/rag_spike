CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old female, end stage renal disease admitted with shortness of breath and then right arm tremor.  Past history of left arm weakness and stroke in 1995.
MEDICATIONS:  Glucagon, Dextrose
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a poorly organized pattern with shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  At times this is much more prominent on the left than the right.  Stimulation of the patient produces more of an alpha theta background.  There are occasional sharp waves noted in the record.  These can be seen from either hemisphere and occur out of a sharply contoured background.  These may be maximum in the left central parietal, right posterior temporal, or left mid to anterior temporal region.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Prominent shifting arrhythmic delta activity, a bit more so from the left.
Epileptiform activity identified from either hemisphere out of a sharply contoured background, T4/T6 maximum.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptic seizures were recorded.  The right arm tremor was not recorded.  This EEG supports an irritable cortex which may be part of the
patient's metabolic insufficiency, but correlation with imaging and clinical history is important.
