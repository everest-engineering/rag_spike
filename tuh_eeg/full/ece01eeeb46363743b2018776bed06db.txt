CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed male with epilepsy, seizure-free either since 2005 or 2007.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat unusual. Much of the record includes an 11 Hz alpha rhythm but there is also some additional occipitally predominant activity which seems to be reactive to eye opening which is at 8.7 Hz and 17 to 19 Hz. There is also a spontaneous section in the record with eye closure with the appearance of a state of frequency background although that is not so clearly a harmonic of the faster frequency activity. The burst, at 2:11:26, is not associated with clinical changes and occurs at the beginning of the record. The activity at 2:11 includes 4Hz and 16Hz activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background. In the transition to
sleep, there is some subtle slowing in the right centrotemporal region. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
I. A suggestion of some right central temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The faster frequency activity and the multiple harmonics in this record are of unclear clinical significance. Although there is no definitive epileptiform activity, the possibility of an occipital epileptiform focus could be considered. In addition, the harmonic and subharmonic activity may obscure another underlying epileptiform discharge.
