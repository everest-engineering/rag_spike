LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  20 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 30-year-old man status post assault and head trauma who presents after a seizure.  The patient is very agitated during the study.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 an dT2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  These are anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is present.  During sleep symmetrical sleep spindles are observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  In the second half of the recording the patient is agitated and significant movement artifact is present that limits interpretation of the EEG during those time periods.  Mild sinus tachycardia is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
Intermittently excessive movement that limits interpretation of the study.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 20 minute EEG.  Certain periods of the recording contain excessive movement.  During those periods, interpretation of the EEG is limited.  However, no clear electrographic seizures were captured.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
