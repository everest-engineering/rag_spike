CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed male. The patient has history of
seizures for 10 years with increase in syncopal episodes.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Famotidine
INTRODUCTION:
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
seizures for 1 0 years with increase in syncopal episodes.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are preformed. The patient is in a hard collar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low to medium amplitude.
There was an glimpse of a 9 hertz alpha rhythm. The patient rapidly drifts off to sleep
with rhythmic background slowing. In what is likely maximal wakefulness, there is a
small amount of frontocentral theta. This is relatively symmetric.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Small amount of excess frontocentral theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. The frontocentral
theta could be due to this patient's injury or his medications. If further characterization of
his epilepsy is important, a repeat study in the lab when is he out of the hard collar is
advised.
