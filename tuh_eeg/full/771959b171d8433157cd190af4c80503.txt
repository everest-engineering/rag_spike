History:	84 YR OLD  FEMALE WITH  PRIOR EEG PRESENTS WITH CHANGE IN MENTAL
STATUS AND SUDDEN ONSET OF RT SIDED WEAKNESS.  PMHX HTN, RENAL
FAILURE . CT NEG
Medications:	HEPARIN, HYDRALAZINE, LABETALOL, CALCITRIOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta
activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous left frontotemporal focal slowing, which has a
high correlation with a structural lesion in that region. In addition there is  diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clear seizures were seen.
