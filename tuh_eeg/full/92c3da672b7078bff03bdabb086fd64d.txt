REACHED HOSPITAL, THE INTUBATED IN ED. NO PMHX
Medications:
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, lethargic
Description:
Background activity was characterized by disorganized diffuse delta and theta activity with
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No posterior dominant
rhythm was present.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 110.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Technically limited
, Tachycardia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  EEG is limited because of
abundant electrode and movement artifact.  If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG.
