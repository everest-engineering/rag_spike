CLINICAL HISTORY: A 19-year-old male with 2 recent episodes of nocturnal Incontinence and single nocturnal convulsions on the morning of the 4th.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital Video EEG was performed in the tab using standard 10.20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is a technically acceptable record capturing wakefulness and sleep with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. The patient was noted to be quite somnolent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The vast majority of the EEG captures stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS. The patient was asleep during photic stimulation and no significant driving response was noted. Hyperventilation was performed for this very drowsy patient which elicited bursts of rhythmic 4-5 Hz frontal theta but no definitive spike and wave activity.

Scant wakefulness was noted and included an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record. In this young adult with new-onset epilepsy, a repeat study perhaps In the fasting state with additional hyperventilation
Is suggested.
