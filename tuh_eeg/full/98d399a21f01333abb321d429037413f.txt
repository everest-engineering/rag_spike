History:	20 YR MALE WITH 2 EPISODES OF SZS LAST YR. PT WAS NERVOUS ABOUT NEW SCHOOL THEN TEST. LOC/ GTC WITH LITTLE POST CONFUSION. EEG TO GET DRIVERS LICENSE BACK
Medications:	DEPAKOTE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During limited stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces 3 second bursts of generalized irregular, frontally-maximal delta slowing. At times sharply contoured. The patient was only asked once to open his eyes during the burst and he seemed to respond appropriately. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. HR was 66

Summary of Findings:
Hyperventilation response, Bursts of irregular sharply contoured diffuse delta.

Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Please note that during hyperventilation he developed a paroxysmal irregularly delta bursts. The bursts had a sharp frontal contoured which may at time be seen with fragmented generalized spike and wave. Repeated prolonged EEG may be helpful in clarifying the underlying significance of the bursts.
