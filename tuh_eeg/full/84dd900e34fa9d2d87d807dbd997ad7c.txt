CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year old right handed woman status post left-sided meningioma resection with progressive memory impairment, concrete thinking, and behavioral issues.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Diovan, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. There is occasional focal slowing from the left temporal region. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Occasional focal slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with the previous craniotomy with a breech rhythm. No epileptiform features were seen today. Sharp waves were seen in previous EEGs in 2007 and 2009.
