CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old male status post craniotomy, hospitalized since December 13th.  Gunshot wound to the head, on 1-in-1 because of agitation and in isolation because of MRSA, evaluate for agitation. Hx of tonic-clonic seizures in the last 2 months,
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, digoxin, vancomycin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically somewhat challenging record with muscle and movement artifact, craniotomy defect.  Most impedances were under 5 kiloohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an in both a diffusely slow and poorly organized pattern with superimposed focal features noted in the right hemisphere, particularly frontocentral and centrotemporal.  A breach rhythm was noted with accentuation of faster frequency in that region.
The EEG from the right waxes and wanes, some sections demonstrate significantly more arrhythmic delta than others.  The left hemisphere demonstrates generous beta and theta frequency activity without such a well defined posterior dominant rhythm.
Sleep was not achieved.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the right hemisphere.
Intermittent disruption for faster frequency activity on the right.
Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a technically challenging EEG as the patient is in  isolation and agitation makes it more difficult, but no seizures were recorded and there were no epileptiform features.
