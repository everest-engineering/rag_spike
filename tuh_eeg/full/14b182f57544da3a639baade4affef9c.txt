CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old man with asthma presents with new-onset seizures, now found rigid and was not breathing.
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation were performed.  No photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded only in wakefulness.  Activating procedure including hyperventilation was only performed.  There were no abnormal discharges during hyperventilation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If there is a clinical question about epilepsy, further recording capturing deeper stages of sleep will be helpful in elucidating or confirming the diagnosis.
