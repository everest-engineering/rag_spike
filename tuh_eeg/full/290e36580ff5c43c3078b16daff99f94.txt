History:	54 year old male with history of subdural hematoma and now status epilepticus.
Medications:	Dilantin, Keppra, Phenobarbital, Midazolam, Coumadin, Lovenox, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
1 Hz Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) are present in the left hemisphere occurring
through the entire record.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere.
There are continuous monomorphic left hemispheric delta sharp waves discharges occurring through
the entire record. At times there is an associated right hemisphere myogenic artifact.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 95 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left hemispheric
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of 1) continuous PLEDs in the left hemispheric region. These
findings are indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in the left
hemisphere. No electrographic seizures are present.  2) continuous focal slowing in the left
hemispheric region.  These findings are indicative of a focal structural lesion.  3) diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
