AGE : 57 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY : 12/29/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1870
HISTORY:
57 y.o. male who had a rapid response called on 12/28/15 for passing out, vomiting, and shaking. Stroke alert was then called for a right facial droop. Patient denies history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lisinopril, Heparin SEDATION: None listed
TECHNIQUE :
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The study consists mostly of drowsiness.
During brief periods of wakefulness, the background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate
amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps), performed during drowsiness, induces minimal symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
