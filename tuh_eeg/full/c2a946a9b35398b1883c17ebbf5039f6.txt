History:	28 year old woman with seizures.
Medications:	trazodone, celexa, buspirone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by moderate amplitude 7 Hz theta rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  The anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient is weak.
Excess diffuse admixed polymorphic 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
complexes appear.  Patient becomes drowsy and falls asleep easily.
Continuous polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the bilateral posterior quadrants.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, slow
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral posterior, mild-to-moderate
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
continuous mild-to-moderate focal slowing over the bilateral posterior quadrants. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but, in this
patient, could be related to excessive drowsiness.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
