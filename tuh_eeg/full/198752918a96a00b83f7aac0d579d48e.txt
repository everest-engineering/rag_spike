CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old man with history of 2 seizures and confusion, anxiety, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, history of 2 provoked seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Metformin.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a mildly excessive amount of beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness only.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation which revealed no abnormal discharges and during photic stimulation, the patient started having muscle twitching that is somewhat reminiscent of photomyogenic response, but it also occurred in between the photic stimulation.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The photomyogenic response has no clinical significance.  The mild excessive theta can be seen at times with the use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
