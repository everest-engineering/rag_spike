CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old male with intermittent syncopal spells.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol.

INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was encouraged to use an exercise bike.  He experienced 1spell, had 4 PB (three were accidental) and one episode of Vtach to 160 identified by telemetry (patient not aware of this.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  Stage 2 sleep included vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts.  The slowing sleep include higher quantities of 2 Hz delta.

Although, the patient has reported that he felt that he slept poorly, sleep in this section of the record was more sustained.
Events
# 1 Accidental PB 9:35 getting out of bed, HR 104 normal EEG
# 2 Accidental PB 10:23 off camera, HR 104 normal EEG
#3 “palpitations”  Rapid HR at 6:51 HR 104 normal EEG No change with PB
#4 8:12 PM  Rapid HR normal EEG
Heart rate is 60-80 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is the end of 72 hours of continuous video EEG monitoring and is remarkable for:
1. The absence of epileptiform activity.
2. Tachycardia
Clinical Correlation: these events to not appear to be seizures
