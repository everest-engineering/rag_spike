History:	40 year old woman with a history of seizures.  She had a single seizure today.
Medications:	gabapentin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During very brief awakening , the waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-9Hz alpha
rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Abundant sleep spindles are captured, even during
wakefulness.  Patient is asleep throughout most of the appointment, and POSTS, vertex waves and
sleep spindles are captured.
No focal slowing is present.  A single right frontocentral sharp transient is captured during sleep.  It
has maximal scalp negativity over F4/C4.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2, abundant
Sharp transients, one, occurs during sleep;maximal scalp negativity over F4/C4
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal mostly asleep and briefly awake portable 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  In this patient mild diffuse slowing could be attributed to excessive drowsiness.  The
single sharply contoured waveform in the right frontocentral region is of unclear clinical
significance.  Given the fact that it occurred during sleep, it could represent a displaced vertex
