CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed woman with a past medical history of psych history, hypertension, and diabetes, with visual and auditory hallucinations for many years; however, have increased recently.  She has mostly visual hallucinations where she sees shadows and feels things when she closes her eyes, and she sees monsters.
MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide, Lisinopril, Trazodone, Celexa, Xanax, Atenolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:   None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG has a 9 to 10 Hz alpha rhythm with an amplitude of 30 microvolts, frontocentral theta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude.  This is an awake study with minimal drowsiness.  Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response.
HR:    84 bpm
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   None
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be considered.
