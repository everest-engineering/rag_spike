CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old woman who presents for 1 episode of breakthrough seizures.  Her seizures started in 2012 after resection of an unknown tumor.  Her last seizure was on 07/03/2013 with convulsion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, gabapentin, lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  The digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm is 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is 6-7 Hz diffuse theta activity seen during wakefulness, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in the driving response.  Hyperventilation was performed with symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta activity seen in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above finding could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat sleep-deprived EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
