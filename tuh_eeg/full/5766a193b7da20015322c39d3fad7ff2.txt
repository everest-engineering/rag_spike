CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old left handed lung-transplant patient with an episode of
loss of balance 3 weeks ago. Patient feels that the loss of balance was associated with
medication side effect.
MEDICATIONS: Neurontin, Lasix, Bactrim, CellCept, Celexa, Folic Acid, Flomax
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. There is a small amount of rhythmic background theta and scant, shifting theta.
Features of drowsiness include a hypersynchronous background with both a 7.5 Hz and
8.5 Hz activity. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation does not
activate the record. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very modest background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION This patient's medications may play a roll in the excess
theta described above. There were no epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is
an important consideration, a follow-up study can be considered.
