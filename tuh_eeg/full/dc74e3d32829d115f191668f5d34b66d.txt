CLINICAL HISTORY: Adult male found in the field with cocaine overdose, status post
multiple sedative hypnotic medications.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there is some technical challenges, the
overall EEG is very low voltage and slow. There are some sections with a bit more
rhythmic theta in the background. There also appears to be a right posterior sharp
wave, negative at 02, but sometimes positive at T6. Stimulation of the patient seems to
produce a bit more arrhythmic delta, particularly on the right.
HR: 126 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity and question of sharp waves in the right posterior region.
CLINICAL This remains a very slow record, but is a little bit more
rhythmic than the previous day. No epileptiform features were noted.
