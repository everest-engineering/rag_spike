LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history since the age of 18.  Seizures are reported as cessation of speech, followed by humming, followed by generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Abilify, ciprofloxacin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Intermittent bifrontal monomorphic theta activity, right greater than left, is captured during wakefulness.  Voltages are overall low.  During sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles and K complexes are noted.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not produce additional abnormalities.  Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is observed over the right anterior temporal region.  Additionally, occasional sharp waves with after-going slow waves are noted over the bilateral anterior temporal regions, right greater than left, with a phase reversal over F7/T1 and F8/T2 electrodes.  A heart rate of 160 beats per minute is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild slowing, right anterior temporal region.
Occasional right anterior temporal and less frequent left anterior temporal sharp waves with after-going slow waves.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to mild right anterior temporal slowing and occasional independent bilateral anterior temporal epileptiform discharges, right greater than left.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  There is an epileptogenic focus over the bilateral anterior temporal regions, right greater than left.
