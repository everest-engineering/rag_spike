TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the recording there is a head rocking artifact, intermittently she stops and a normal EEG could be seen.  Otherwise it is difficult to interpret.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens in limited times that there is no rocking artifact there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded only in wakefulness.  The hyperventilation was performed but did not clearly have any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Limited normal EEG.
