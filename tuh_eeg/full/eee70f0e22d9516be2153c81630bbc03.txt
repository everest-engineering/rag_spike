CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old male, status post basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage.  Unresponsive, tracheostomy with eye deviation.  The patient had generalized shaking movements on January 30, and has eye deviation at this time.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Ativan, labetalol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is somewhat responsive to stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta activity.  Superimposed upon this is intermittent, focal slowing from the left hemisphere typically centrotemporal.  Out of this background, there is some sharply contoured slowing and there are also some bursts of more rhythmic theta out of the left.  The rhythmic theta out of the left seems to occur after tactile or auditory stimulation.  Other features of responsiveness including increasing faster frequency activity and some frontal beta.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
An asymmetry with focal slowing and sharply contoured slowing on the left.
In a section of the record with tactile stimulation, there is suspicious underlying sharp waves in the left centrotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports diffuse disturbance of cerebral function involving the left hemisphere more significantly than the right.  Sharp waves were noted on the left. There are 2 previous EEGs for this patient, April 21, 2008 and November 16, 2005.  Correlation with previous studies may be helpful as there may be a premorbid neurological history.
