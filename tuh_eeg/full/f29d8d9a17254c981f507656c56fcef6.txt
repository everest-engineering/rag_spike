CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed male with coronary artery disease, stroke, ICA
occlusion versus stenosis for left carotid endarterectomy. Previous left frontal parietal
hemorrhage and vasogenic edema.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Percocet, Pantoprazole
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0Â·20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an asymmetry. The left
hemisphere is a bit slower than the right with a bit more disorganization, variability in the alpha
rhythm and a bit more theta. The alpha rhythm is 9.7 on the right, intermittently slower on the
left. In addition there are sharp waves or sharply contoured delta, maximum at T3, as well as
bursts of more rhythmic focal slowing on the left frontal region. Features of stage 1 sleep
include vertex waves and spindles. The patient transitions in and out of sleep. As the patient
becomes drowsy there are occasional bursts of occipital delta, but the delta is more prominent.
higher amplitude and slower in the left hemisphere than the right. There are also some bursts
of some isolated delta in the left hemisphere, again, more prominent occipitally. Photic
stimulation elicits scant driving, better demonstrated on the right than the left.
HR: 66 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An asymmetry with slowing identified from the left hemisphere.
2. Sharply contoured slowing from the left.
3. Disruption of the alpha on the left.
CLINICAL It is somewhat unusual to see focal slowing, which is either frontal,
temporal, or occipital. The sharply contoured slowing and sharp waves could be associated
with an intracerebral hemorrhage. These findings support a structural process on the left
involving gray and white matter. This process should be also considered potentially
epileptogenic.
