CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with previous right sphenoid wing meningioma resection in November, now with staring spells lasting 1 minute.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient was noted to have a craniotomy defect.  Hyperventilation was also completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized from the right hemisphere with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  A similar alpha rhythm was noted on the right.  The right hemisphere demonstrates a breech rhythm with essentially continuous focal slowing from the right anterior temporal region.  Despite the breech rhythm, there are discreet F8 sharp waves noted.  Disruption of faster frequency activity was also noted in the right anterior temporal region.  Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing in the right anterior temporal and central temporal region.  In this sharply contoured record, there is a suggestion of a T4 sharp wave noted.  Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.  The driving response is present bilaterally, but sometimes a bit more vigorous on the left.  Heart rate 72 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous right frontotemporal focal slowing.
2. In the context of a breech rhythm, rare, right anterior temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The right anterior temporal focal slowing was noted in a previous study.  The focal slowing and sharp waves are in the region of her neurosurgical intervention.
