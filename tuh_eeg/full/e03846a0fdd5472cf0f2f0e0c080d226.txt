CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old man with hep C, anxiety, and status post having change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The amplitude during the recording is severely depressed and very difficult to see any normal cerebral activity.  There is some ventilator and EKG artifact throughout the recording. Please note the heart rate in this patient is about 120 seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves with severely depressed amplitude at 2 Hz.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing and severely suppressed amplitude.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology but may be seen due to a diffuse cerebral injury seen sometimes in hypoxia or due to severe metabolic or
medication-induced encephalopathy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
