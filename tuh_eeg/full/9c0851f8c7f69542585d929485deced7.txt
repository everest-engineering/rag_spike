History:	53 YR WOMAN WITH INCREASE IN SEIZURES AND MIGRAINES.  PMHX:
POSTPARTUM SZS . ECLAMPSIA, DURAL SINUS THROMBOSIS.  PT
DESCRIBES SEVERAL DIFFERENT EVENTS STARING, GTC, NOCTURNAL AND
RIGHT SIDE SHAKING.
Medications:	KLONOPIN, STADOL, TOPAMAX, BOTOX, VALIUM, EFFEXOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excessive, continuous high voltage 18-25 Hz beta activity is present,
maximal frontally.  The patient is awake only and no drowsiness or sleep was observed.
Intermittent rhythmic slowing is present in the bi frontal regions.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces focal slowing
in the bi-frontal regions.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any significant effect.  HR is 90 bpm
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous
No electrographic seizures
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the
medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
