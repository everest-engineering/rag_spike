CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed man with history of headaches and head trauma, hyperlipidemia, osteopenia, as well as blacking out spells and questionable convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep. Activating procedures during photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharges, but hyperventilation accentuates focal slowing as described below.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen independently at T3 and T4 independently and this is at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV.  The slowing is accentuated by hyperventilation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
