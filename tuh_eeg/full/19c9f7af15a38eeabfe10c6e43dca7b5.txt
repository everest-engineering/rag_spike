History:	52 year old woman with seizures.
Medications:	Topamax, Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  Irregular heart
rate with inter-QRS interval of up to 1.5 seconds is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Irregular heart rate
with inter-QRS interval of up to 1.5 seconds is noted on a single EKG lead.
