History:	34 year old woman undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy
Medications:	Heparin, cefuroxime, ketamine, Vecuronium, Isofluorine, vasopressin, Lidocaine,
insulin, sufentanil
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and
subtemporal chain, awake
Description:
While patient is awake, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated 10 Hz
moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  At ~ 7:48 am, there is a
change in the background with disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm and appearance of
diffuse excess beta activity.  This corresponds to initiation of general anesthesia.  The background
eventually becomes a mixture of various frequencies.  Circulatory arrests starts at ~ 9:52 am.  As the
temperature decreases, there is gradual increase in diffuse delta activity and disappearance of
faster frequencies.  Burst suppression starts at ~ 10:25 am when the body temperature is ~ 25
degrees C.  Complete burst suppression is achieved at ~ 11:08am. Subsequently very brief (~1 sec)
bursts of diffuse delta activity are observed every several minutes.  The attending surgeon was
notified of these bursts of activity.  Once circulatory arrest is completed and rewarming starts, burst
of activity return at ~ 1:18 PM.  There is rapid disappearance of burst suppression and appearance
of a mixture of frequencies and a symmetrical background.  This pattern persists for the rest of the
recording.
Summary of Findings:
Other, uneventful study
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 7 hours 21 minutes (with 4 hours and 20 minutes of direct live remote review)
continuous intraoperative EEG monitoring.
