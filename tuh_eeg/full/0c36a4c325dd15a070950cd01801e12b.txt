CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory right temporal lobe epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, phenobarbital, metformin, lisinopril, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was sleep deprived, and phenobarbital was reduced, but no seizures were recorded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by very subtle focal slowing noted from the right hemisphere.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles were noted in sleep.
Seizures:  None.
Interictal Epileptiform Abnormalities:  This section of the record demonstrates abundant, high amplitude, right anterior temporal sharp waves.
Heart Rate:  76 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is the final day of video EEG recording for a patient who unfortunately had to leave the unit early.  It is remarkable for:
Abundant, right anterior temporal spikes and sharp waves, some of which are high amplitude, noted primarily in sleep but on rare occasions seen in drowsiness.
Subtle focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.  Only a single, left anterior temporal sharp wave was noted.  This patient was advised to continue hospitalization in an attempt to record seizures, but she declined, due to personal circumstances.
