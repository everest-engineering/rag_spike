CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed male with past medical history of seizures, COPD, headaches, left CVA in 2009, diabetes, third nerve palsy, as well as hypertension, who presents with an EEG for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Norvasc, Tramadol, Zocor, Lisinopril, Citalopram.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and stage I sleep were recorded.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Almost continuous T3 temporalis muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with 20-60 mV amplitude.  Normal frontal central beta is seen.
Sleep is characterized by stage I of limited duration.  Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is normal.  Note:  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  There has been no change from the previous EEG dated November 6, 2009 which was also noted to be normal.
