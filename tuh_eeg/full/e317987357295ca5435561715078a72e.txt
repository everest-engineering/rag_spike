CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 76-year-old gentleman status post code on 11/19/2012.  The patient coded in the field and arrived in the hospital in asystole with an 11-minute code.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan drip, Dilantin, Zosyn, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is relatively high amplitude, poorly organized.  The activity includes a frontal periodic sharp wave, some shifting sharp waves, and even some focal ones including frontal, right temporal.  There are some periodic complexes in the record and the complexes vary from hemisphere to hemisphere, as well as with the field of spread.  In addition, the patient is having trembling of the chin and the trembling of the chin does not have the same periodicity as the epileptiform activity.  Intermittently, the background EEG attenuates and when it does the chin trembling stopped.  Sometimes, the chin movement is almost cyclic and on other occasions, it does appear to have a bit of periodic jerking.  Stimulation of the patient, there is some variability in the background and some sections of the record are richer in theta frequency activity.  Heart rate 96 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A profoundly abnormal background.
2. Intermittent attenuation.
3. A number of different epileptiform and post anoxic patterns including focal sharp waves, frontal periodic complexes, and some triphasic waves.
4. Involuntary movement of the chin which does not entirely correlate with the epileptiform activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are hallmarks of the severe anoxic insult.  Ongoing clinical evaluation and perhaps EEG recording may be needed.
