AGE: 43 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Outpatient
EEG TYPE: routine awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1358
HISTORY:
43 y.o. male with a history of "stroke on left side" and a prior reported stroke in 2008. No history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:
lisinopril
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse
background slowing are seen.
There are normal stage I sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves. Stage II sleep transients, including sleep spindles and K-complexes were not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Not performed
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal . finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.
If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
