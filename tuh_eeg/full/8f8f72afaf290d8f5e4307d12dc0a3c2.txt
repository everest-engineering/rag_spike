AGE: 63 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 12/29/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1874
HISTORY:
63 y.o. female with a history of dementia, Hep C, HTN, TBI, alcohol abuse, and IV drug abuse who was
transferred from an outside hospital after she was found confused and covered in bruises and feces. She was found to have a UTI as well as hydrocephalus. She is referred for routine EEG for assessment of mental status change.
MEDICATIONS: OXYBUTYNIN, CIPRO, THERAGRAN, AMLODIPINE, RIFAXIMIN, LOVENOX, MONTELUKAST, TRAZODONE
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a fairly organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with excess of theta and delta frequencies. There is a symmetric and reactive 10 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) . The normal
anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present but suboptimal.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
Mild generalized slowing is present.
There is occasional subtle attenuation of faster frequencies seen over the left temporal region.
RHYTHMIC AND/OR EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
1. Occasional frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA, also known as GRDA or generalized rhythmic delta activity) is present at 1 Hz for runs <  10 sec
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing and suboptimal organization
Occasional subtle attenuation of faster frequencies over the left temporal region
Occasional frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity
(FIRDA, also known as GRDA or generalized rhythmic delta activity)
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of left temporal cortical injury superimposed on mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
Frontally predominant generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA, also known as FIRDA) is a nonspecific but pathologic finding that is most commonly seen in toxic-metabolic states, but may also be seen with deep structural lesions or increased intracranial pressure. Clinical correlation is advised.
