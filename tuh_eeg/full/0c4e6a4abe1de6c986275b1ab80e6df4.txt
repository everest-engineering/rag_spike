CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old male status post gunshot wound to right cranium in 1957, seizure-free since 1992. The patient had a recent lung transplant six weeks ago and remained seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS:  Lexapro, phenobarbital, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed but hyperventilation was not possible.  The EEG was performed using the appropriate techniques for this acute post-transplant patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the left hemisphere is reasonably well organized with an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a glimpse of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm noted on the right but the right hemisphere demonstrates nearly continuous focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity and a bit more 2-4 Hz activity in the right hemisphere.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Focal slowing in the right hemisphere is relatively continuous and a bit more prominent in the right posterior quadrant, particularly T6/P4.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  78 BMP, initially somewhat irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Nearly continuous focal slowing in the right hemisphere.
Mild slowing of the left hemisphere relative to a previous study October 2012.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal slowing described above is very similar to the first study.  A breach rhythm is not as obvious in this EEG, however, there was a bit more muscle artifact on the right.  The mild slowing from the left hemisphere may be part of the acute post-transplant changes but if there is any question about cognitive impacts of this patient's medications, additional clinical evaluation or neurophysiological assessment may be of value.
