History:	88 year old man status post a recent right hemispheric SDH evacuation and
subsequent focal status epilepticus.
Medications:	Depakote, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, asleep
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude polymorphic 8-9 Hz activity.  It is better
formed over the left.  The AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess theta activity and underriding delta
activity are noted.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
Continuous polymorphic sharply contoured delta activity is present in the right posterior temporal-
parietal region.  No clear epileptiform discharges are observed.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right, posterior temporal- parietal region
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 21-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and continuous moderate right posterior temporal- parietal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is
indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  When compared to
the continuous EEG from 09/07/2015, epileptiform discharges are no longer seen.
