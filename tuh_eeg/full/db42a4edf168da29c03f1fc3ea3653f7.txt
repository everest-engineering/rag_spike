TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with a 20-80 microvolt amplitude.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE:  None.
