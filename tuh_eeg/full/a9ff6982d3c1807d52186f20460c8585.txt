CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old woman status post treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage with dysconjugate gaze and unresponsive to verbal stimulation.

MEDICATIONS: Midazolam, Fentanyl, Labetalol, Heparin, Dilantin, Bicitra, Lorazepam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has a tracheostomy and is unresponsive but has eye movements.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is very low voltage, relatively featureless and a bit more suppressed on the left compared to the right. There is a bit of variability noted in the background with frontal fast activity of 11 Hz to 15 Hz activity is noted in the frontal regions on occasion.

HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Lower voltage relatively featureless pattern.
2. Relatively isolated frontal fast activity.
3. A bit more remarkable slow featureless slowing on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's eye movements are not associated with epileptiform activity. This record is lower voltage than previously noted. It is emerging into more of a lower voltage suppressed pattern with frontal fast activity suggesting relatively wide spread cerebral insult
