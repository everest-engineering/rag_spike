CLINICAL HISTORY:  52  year old right handed female with hypoglycemic seizures.


MEDICATIONS:  Zocor, Synthroid, Metoprolol, Norvasc, Pantoprazole,  Lisinopril, Insulin


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with rhythmic theta and smaller amounts of alpha frequency activity. There are brief portions of the record with an increase in delta activity or attenuation of the background.  Stimulation of the patient elicits and alerting response with an increase in faster frequency activity. Occasional bifrontal generalized periodic complexes are noted.

HR: 	84  bpm


IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Replacement of a normal background with rhythmic background mixed frequency activity primarily theta.
2. 	Rare generalized periodic complexes


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. In  comparison to previous studies, the record is markedly improved. Although there are a handful of periodic complexes, no sustained epileptiform features were noted.
