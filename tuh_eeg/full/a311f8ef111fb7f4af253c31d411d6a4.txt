INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 to 40 microvolts with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by sign of the alpha rhythm, slow rolling eye movements, and an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces no significant change in the EEG.  Heart rate 78 BPM.
