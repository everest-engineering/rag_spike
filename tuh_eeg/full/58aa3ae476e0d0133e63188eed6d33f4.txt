History:	47 YO FEMALE FOUND AT BOTTOM OF STAIRS BY HUSBAND, SHAKING.
DOESN'T BELIEVE SHE HAD LOC, BUT WAS SHAKING. HAVING ONE EVENT
PER MONTH. PT RECENTLY RELEASED FROM JEFFERSON W/DX SUDO-SZ.
MOSTLY AT NIGHT. PMHX: BIPOLAR, ETOH, GERD, HTN, DEPRESSION, POD, SZ
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, OXYCODONE, CREON, LAMICTAL, LABETALOL, AMLODIPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV,
18-25Hz activity is also seen.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout
the recording and increases during drowsiness. At times the background becomes disorganized and
sharply countoured.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  HR
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse, At times disorganized.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing. This
finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
