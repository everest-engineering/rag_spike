CLINICAL HISTORY:  53-year-old gentleman admitted 5 weeks ago status post C-spine injury, long hospital course with multiple medical problems including VDRF, DVT, hypoxic insult, now transitioning to a chronic encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Ritalin, Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Patient is intubated with intermittent stiffening.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a low voltage, featureless slow pattern with a mixture of delta and theta.  Intermittently, there is an increase in muscle activity which obscures the EEG.  The patient is noted to have spontaneous eye movements, but is not interactive.
The overall EEG does not appear to be reactive or variable.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a markedly slow pattern.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is very similar to the 2 previous EEGs, August 7 and August 27, which both demonstrated marked background slowing.  This EEG has a little bit more theta, but demonstrates no clinically significant change.
