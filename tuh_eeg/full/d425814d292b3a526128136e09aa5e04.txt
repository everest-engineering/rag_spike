History:	36 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF SEIZURES. CC OF NOT SELF STARING.  PT
ALSO WITH NIGHTTIME SZS. 2.  PMHX: MR, DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYED
06/15/15- ADMITTED TO THE EMU
Medications:	ZONISAMIDE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional focal spikes and polyspike discharges present with phase
reversal and amplitude maximum at C4/ T6, C4 and P3/T5.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Polyspikes, left posterior quadrant
Spikes, intermittent, right central, and posterior temporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the right central and
posterior temporal region as well as the left posterior quadrant region.  These findings are
indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in these regions. In addition there is  diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
