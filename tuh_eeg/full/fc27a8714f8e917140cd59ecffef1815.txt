CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 69-year-old woman with a left carotid stenosis.

INTRODUCTION:  Twenty-minute digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient is quite drowsy throughout much of the EEG and drifts off to stage 2 sleep.  In the transition, slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm was noted.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate irregular at 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal 20-minute routine EEG without focal slowing.
