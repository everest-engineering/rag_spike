CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 62-year-old man who has a history of stroke/TIA in 2010.  The patient presents with reported seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, Keppra, lisinopril, simvastatin, amlodipine, carvedilol, and Lasix.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low amplitude 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Intermittent lambda wave forms are captured.
During brief drowsiness there is an increase in the diffuse amount of theta.  Intermittent focal left anterior temporal theta and delta activity are captured.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
A single lead EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate with pauses between the beats lasting up to 1.5 seconds.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild to moderate left anterior temporal focal slowing.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal, mostly awake and briefly drowsy, 22-minute EEG due to intermittent focal left anterior temporal slowing.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction that could be structural in etiology.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  Cardiac arrhythmia with interbeat pauses up to 1.5 seconds is captured in a single EKG lead.
