LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  20 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has cognitive dysfunction and seizures.  The last seizure was approximately 1 month ago.  The seizures are characterized by eye fluttering, __________ and shallow rapid breaths.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Keppra, Zanaflex and loratadine.
CONDITIONING OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according tot he standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This was a technically difficult study since the patient was not cooperative.  Therefore, high impedances were present at the beginning of the recording on several electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is continuous movement throughout the recording that limits interpretation of the recording.  During several periods of relative calmness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude, polymorphic 10-11 Hz alpha activity.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is preserved.  No normal sleep architecture is present.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Step photic stimulation appears to resolve in symmetrical occipital driving at high rate/frequencies.  No obvious electrographic seizures were captured.
FINDINGS:
Technically a limited study due to nearly continuous movement.
No stage II sleep.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This appears to be a normal 20-minute awake only electroencephalogram.  However, there was a continuous significant movement throughout the study and focal changes and epileptiform discharges might have been missed.
