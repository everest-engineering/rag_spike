CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed male with microcephaly, history of anoxic brain injury, recurrent seizures. Last seizure was about a year ago. Recent hospitalization in June of 2011 for arrhythmia requiring defibrillator.  Transposition of great vessels.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  The patient's stimulator discharged during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is generous frontocentral beta.  There is intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm, particularly in the right occipital region.  This is quite infrequent.  Features of drowsiness include some bursts of hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  There are rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the left mid temporal region as well as rare, independent bursts on the right with a well-defined right T4 sharp wave noted during photic stimulation.  Photic stimulation also elicits a driving response.
HR:    60 bpm, with evidence of an active pacemaker discharge.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm, particularly on the right.
Bursts of somewhat irregular paroxysmal slowing in the transition to drowsiness.
Rare bursts of sharply contoured slowing which may be seen on the right or left.
Rare right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG suggests a bihemispheric process.  Epileptiform activity was identified from the right, but there is also some suspicious activity on the left.  If additional information is needed, either a comparison with childhood EEGs or a follow-up sleep study may be of value.
