CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed man with skull fracture, was admitted on the 25th and had a seizure during the CAT scan.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. The patient is awake and able to follow commands. There are impedance issues due to the dried blood on the scalp.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness the background EEG is somewhat slow with a rhythmic theta pattern. There are a handful of shifting asymmetries. There is some artifact at T3. Features of drowsiness include a slowing of the background. Brief vertex waves are noted. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study is recommended. In this individual with head trauma, a repeat EEG should be performed following discharge.
