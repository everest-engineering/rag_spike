CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old woman with a past history of cerebral abscesses, skull defect, sarcoid.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Previous EEGs were not available today for comparison.  Photic stimulation was completed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is reasonably well organized with a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, generous background theta and generous frontocentral beta.  Bursts of drowsiness are characterized by paroxysmal rhythmic slowing.  Occasional shifting slowing is noted with a breach rhythm in the left central temporal region as the patient becomes a bit drowsier.  Prominent frontocentral beta is noted in the transition to drowsiness, again accentuated in area with the breach.

Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving at faster flash frequencies.

Heart rate 108 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Superimposed left frontocentral focal slowing in the region of the patient's previous craniotomy.
3. Shifting slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Similar to 1 Previous EEG available for comparison today.  No epileptiform features were noted in either study.  The focal features are in the region of the patient's known craniotomy.  The excess beta may be due to medications.
