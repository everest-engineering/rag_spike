CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old woman, admitted on June 27th for 24-hour change in mental status, evaluate for possible complex partial epilepsy, and history of anxiety.

MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, aspirin, Percocet, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory, 20-minute EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient is primarily in stage II sleep with spindles, K complexes, vertex waves, and POSTs.  Stimulation of the patient elicits an arousal with a well defined 10 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant alpha rhythm.

Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.

Heart rate 66 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
