CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old right handed female with syncope, collapse. Status post gamma knife radiation for meningioma.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Technical challenges for this EEG included quality of the patient's scalp and hair.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is a relatively low pattern with generous beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Drowsiness includes rhythmic theta with vertex waves. Muscle artifact persists in the EEG into 2 stage sleep.
POSTS are noted in sleep and lambda waves are noted in wakefulness. The patient is drifting in and out of sleep during photic stimulation.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Somewhat slow alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. If additional information is needed, a follow up study with more complete wakefulness and sleep is advised.
