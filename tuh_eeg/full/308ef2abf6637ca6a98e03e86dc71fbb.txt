Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:



Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.

No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 78.

Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Excessive fast
Interpretation: Normal EEG
