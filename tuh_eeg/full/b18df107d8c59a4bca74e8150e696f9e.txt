75 years
Department of
History:	75 year old man with a tumor, undergoing left meningeal artery embolization.
Medications:	Induction Meds and isoflurane
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
comatose
Description:
Approximately 6 minutes of the EEG is recorded before patient is intubated.  Awake EEG
demonstrates 9 Hz PRD with preserved AP gradient.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the
left hemisphere.  Burst-suppression is noted at the time of intubation.  There is gradual
improvement in the background to a mixture of bursts consisting of a polymorphic low amplitude
theta, delta and underriding fast activity and periods of  background discontinuity and frank burst-
suppression.  Bursts of activity are less prominent and voltage attenuation are more pronounced
over the left hemisphere.  The timing of the embolization is not recorded.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable nearly 2 hour continuous EEG monitoring during IR-guided embolization,
however, the timing of embolization is not recorded, so subtle changes might have been missed.
This is an abnormal EEG due to left hemispheric focal slowing that indicates focal cerebral
dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.
