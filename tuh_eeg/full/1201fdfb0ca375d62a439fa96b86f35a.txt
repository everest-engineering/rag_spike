History:	23 year old woman with a -7 month history of episodes concerning for seizures.
Episodes start with abnormal sensation in her right palm, then progress to hand and then right arm shaking. She then urinates and then loses awareness.
Medications:	None Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Extended, 40-60 min
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1-hour EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
