History:	41 yo female reported sz 1 year ago, recently pt has periods of passing out for 2 - 3
min followed by loss of memory and 2 - 3 min to "snap out of it " back to
baseline._'sz vs passing out cause of anemia".
Medications:	tramadol, abilify, zoloft, ambien
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low voltage 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  There is an artifact in a single EKG lead despite several attempts by the
technologist to fix the issue.  Heart rate appears to be <60 but the information provided by that
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Other, faulty EKG lead
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute awake and drowsy EEG. No epileptiform discharges are present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.  Due to continuous artifact in the EKG, information provided by the
EKG lead is not fully reliable.
