REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old right-handed female who presents with a history of seizures as a child at age 8 to 12 and then became seizure free.  Recently with breast cancer in 2008 and started treatment in 2009 radiation and chemo.  Had a seizure during sleep with tongue biting.  Seizures are now more frequent about 4 in 1 week.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which appears to react to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Please note that there is a very prominent rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness occurring multiple times through the recording.
Abnormal discharges: None.
Seizures: None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
Heart rate is 114.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note the frequent prominent rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness described above.
