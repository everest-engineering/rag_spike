CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old right handed male admitted with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are performed.  The patient was very confused.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized.  In addition, the patient has difficulty sitting still in wakefulness.  There is a slow alpha rhythm of approximately 6 Hz.   Shifting arrhythmic delta was observed.
Occasional discrete sharp waves or spikes were noted including left frontal, F1 and F3 more than F7.  In addition, there were sharp waves noted in the right frontal region with focal slowing.  Head rocking artifact was noted on the right.  Features of drowsiness including increase in delta.  There were a handful of triphasic waves noted in the background and rare vertex waves, but the patient arouses readily.  Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing and disorganization.
A handful of triphasic waves.
Sharp waves noted from the right frontal and temporal region, but also some from the right frontotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  Epileptiform activity has been identified from the right frontal and left temporal regions in the past, similar to today's study.  No seizures were recorded today.
