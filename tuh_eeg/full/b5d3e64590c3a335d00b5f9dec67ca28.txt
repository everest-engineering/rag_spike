CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed woman, with history of recurrent
syncope and head trauma, status post pacemaker.

MEDICATIONS: Celexa, Midodrine.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-2Q
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation was performed. This Is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the patient exhibited a 10Hz alpha
rhythm with 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm. The record appeared normal. Also of
note, the patient exhibited lateral rectus spike waves. The patient also exhibited, in
stage 2 sleep, a twitch artifact, as well as K-complexes. The patient also exhibited
spindles and POSTS in the stage 2 sleep. The record was overall normal study with
some increased amplitude during hyperventilation and some swelling. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving, although the patient is drifting off to sleep.

HR: 54bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this
record. The lateral rectus artifact and the twitch artifact in stage 2 sleep are normal
findings.
