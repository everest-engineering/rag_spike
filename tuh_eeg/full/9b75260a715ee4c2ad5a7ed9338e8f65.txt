History:	26 YO MALE WITH FALL IN SHOWER AND HIT HEAD. UNCLEAR TO HOW LONG
PT WAS UNCONSCIOUS. HAD THREE EVENTS SINCE FALL 3 WEEKS AGO. POOR
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves.  Some of the vertex waves have a pronounced asymmetric after going
slow wave.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
