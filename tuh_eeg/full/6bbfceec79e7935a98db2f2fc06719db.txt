DATE OF STUDY:  March 7 to March  8, 2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old with cerebral palsy, status post VP shunts, previous preterm infant, left VP shunt and skull defect.  Admitted after multiple generalized tonic clonic seizures on the 7th now in the ICU obtunded.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, propofol drip, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was somnolent but was moving about.  No clinical seizures were observed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow.  There are occasional sharp waves noted in the left posterotemporal or occipital scalp region.  There is a suggestion of a breached rhythm with accentuation of faster frequency activities in the left scalp electrodes.
As the overnight recording continues, there is a bit more beta.  The left occipital sharp waves or spikes are a bit more discreet and sometimes have a field in the bioccipital region.
At 10:49, there is a brief train of left occipital spikes and a more prominent breach rhythm with beta in the left hemisphere, particularly the posterior quadrant.
Heart rate:  78 to 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Absence of the normal wave forms for an adult of this age.
Left occipital sharp waves or spikes seen a little bit more prominently briefly around 10 a.m. on the morning of the 8th but not sustained.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient was a bit arousable in the later hours of the EEG.  No clinical seizures were recorded.  If additional information is needed, EEG recording when the patient has recovered to his baseline may be of value.
