History:	27 year old man with a history of seizures.
Medications:	Depakote, Dilantin, Lexapro,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the entire recording.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  There is continuous eye blinking and eye flutter artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, other, eye blinking and eye flutter
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 25 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Continuous eye blinking and eye flutter artifact limits interpretation of the
recording in the anterior quadrants and subtle anterior slowing might have been missed.
