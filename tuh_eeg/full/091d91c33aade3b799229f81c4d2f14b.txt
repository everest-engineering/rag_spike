PMHX ESRD, DM, HLD, HTN.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. There is no normal cerebral activity seen.  Background
activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  There is continuous low voltage beta activity
seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  There is rhythmic head-rocking artifact (due to ventilator) seen during the
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21 minute EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse
