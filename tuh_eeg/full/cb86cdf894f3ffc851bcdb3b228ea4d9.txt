History:	22 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES VS NON EPILEPTIC.  TREMOR OF
HANDS AND WEIRD FEELING IN HEAD.  ONSET POST ANAPHYLACTIC EPISODE
IN OSH THAT RESULTED IN PEA CODE.  PT WITH INFECTION OF SCOLIOSIS
EQUIP IN BACK RESULT 21 SURGERIES.
Medications:	BENADRYL (RECD PRIOR EEG), LORAZEPAM, ZOLOFT, GABAPENTIN,
OXYCODONE, BUSPIRONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation
Description:
Excessive Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
Background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular 4-7Hz activity with over ridding beta.
Some state change can be seen as well as some vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  74
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ambulatory EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absence alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
