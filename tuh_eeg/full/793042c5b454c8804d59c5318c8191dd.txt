CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old woman with 2 seizures on February 16 at home and
3 more on the way to the hospital. Seizures are characterized by loss of consciousness
with right arm shaking. She received Ativan in the field. Evaluate for nonconvulsive
status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, relatively
slow. Superimposed upon this is an asymmetry with a bit higher amplitude activity from
the left compared to the right. In wakefulness there is a bit more sharply contoured
slowing noted from the left. There are some subtle sharp waves at T3. As the patient
becomes drowsy, however, the asymmetry is less prominent and in drowsiness there is
more of a slow lower voltage delta pattern. A handful of these subtle left temporal sharp
waves are maximum at C3 rather than T3. Photic stimulation is performed while the
patient is relatively drowsy and does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right
compared to the left.
3. Subtle sharp wave and sharply contoured slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. In addition, it suggests a focal mechanism for seizures in this individual.
