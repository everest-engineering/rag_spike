History:	58 year old man with a history of HIV now presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	zosyn, ativan during intubation
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Asleep only, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
There is no PDR, no AP gradient and no reactivity.  The background consists of attenuated slow
polymorphic delta activity and intermittent eye-blink-like deflections that correlate with brief
abdominal jerks that are seen on the video.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was minimal reactivity to
auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute portable EEG due to severe diffuse background slowing and lack
of reactivity. These findings are indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.
