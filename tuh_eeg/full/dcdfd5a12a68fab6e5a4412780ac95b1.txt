CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed female with rue twitching and change of mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Zofran, Keppra, Lopressor, Metoprolol, Dilaudid, Zosyn, Dextrose, Glucose.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz, which is somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  In addition, there are intermittent bursts of anterior predominant slowing at times with a triphasic morphology seen intermittently.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Triphasics at 3-4 Hz with anterior predominance.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology; however, the presence of triphasics suggests at least the possibility of a metabolic encephalopathy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
