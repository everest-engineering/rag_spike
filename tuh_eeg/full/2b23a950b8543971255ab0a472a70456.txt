WHILE ON THE FLOOR. PMHX SIG FOR CHF, AORTIC STENOSIS, HTN, HLD,
DM, COPD, A-FIB
Medications:	HEPARIN, MILRINONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, lethargic
Description:
The waking background reveals a PDR that at best reaches 6Hz.  In wakefulness the background
activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage theta activity with absence of the expected anterior
to posterior gradient of frequencies.  At times there are intermittent central predominant waveforms
with a triphasic and at times sharply contoured morphology.  Some stage 1 sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was some reactivity to auditory
and tactile stimuli.  HR is 66, irregular and with PVC's
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  moderate to severe diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
