CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old woman with epilepsy and multiple other medical problems, epilepsy since 2006, HIV, depression and asthma.  Most seizure 1 week ago out of sleep.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, trazodone, lithium, oxycodone, Atripla.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The background includes theta.  There is a slight asymmetry noted with a bit of a lower voltage pattern on the left compared to the right.  The patient is drifting in and out of sleep stage during hyperventilation and, in fact, there is some spindle activity noted.  The technologist notes that the patient is quite sleepy during hyperventilation.  In the transition in and out of stage 2 sleep, there are rare bursts of slowing on the left.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 50 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is abnormal and differs from previous studies in that:
The patient seems to be hypersomnolent.
In maximal wakefulness there is some background slowing.
There is an amplitude asymmetry with a higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right.
Following hyperventilation into transition to sleep, there is some sharply contoured slowing with a single sharp wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the fourth EEG for this individual.  This is the first EEG with the background slowing described above or with a hypersomnolent pattern.  Left temporal sharp waves were noted on only 1 previous EEG.
