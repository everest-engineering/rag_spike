CLINICAL HISTORY:	31 year old man with history of generalized tonic clonic activity during sleep with post ictal unresponsiveness x 3-5 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a very drowsy study. The patient drifts in and out of sleep during the entirety of the study. He does have a background alpha rhythm of 11 Hz. There is also the presence of POSTS, and slow rolling eye movements. During photic stimulation, there is a mild driving response until the patient falls asleep.  Hyperventilation creates an increased amplitude.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There is no epileptiform activity. This was an otherwise normal EEG. Drowsiness may be related to sleep-deprived EEG, however the sleep is not sustained. This may be related to a sleep disorder. Normal EEG's do not exclude epilepsy. Based on clinical correlation, a repeat EEG may be warranted to find focal
features.
