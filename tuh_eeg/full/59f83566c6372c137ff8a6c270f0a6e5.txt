CLINICAL HISTORY:  88 year old right handed man with a history of a syncopal event, transferred from an outside hospital.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncopal episode.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 8 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures, which included photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Mild generalized slowing at 5 to 7 Hz at an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing and sharp waves.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region as well as diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regard
to etiology.  No seizures were captured.  These findings were reported to the consulting so they could be reported to the primary team after the findings were noted.
