History:	58 year old female with recent seizure and now episode of unresponsiveness,
Medications:	Baclofen
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, lethargic,
obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  There are intermittent bifrontal triphasic waves seen throughout the
record.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Triphasic waves, frequent, bilateral frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing, absent alpha rhythm, and
intermittent triphasic waves.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Triphasic waves may be seen in metabolic encephalopathies
including hepatic and renal failure.
