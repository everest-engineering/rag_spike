INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. â•–
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well-.
organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling
eye movements. There is a single burst of sharply contoured slowing which shifts
from the right to the left during hyperventilation.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION; This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A single burst as described above cannot be considered
pathological as it may be artifactual. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a
follow-up, sleep-deprived EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in
characterizing an underlying epileptiform process. Medication review may also be
helpful in search of medications that can lower the seizure threshold.
