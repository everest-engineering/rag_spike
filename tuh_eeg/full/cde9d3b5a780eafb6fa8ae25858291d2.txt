History:	27 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP EEG PMHX SIG FOR 2
EPISODES OF SZ ON 9/1/12 NEW ONSET,LAST SZ X 1 1/2 WEEKS AGO WITH
Medications:	KEPPRA 1000MG 2X A DAY
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
60, sudden changes in frequency are noted form bradycardia to tachycardia.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. No electrographic seizures are present.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
