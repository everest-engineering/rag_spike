CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed woman with mental retardation, recurrent tonic-colonic seizures, recurrent evaluations for brief spells, which were thought to be non epileptic seizures, now a nursing home resident. .
MEDICATIONS:  Colace, Dilantin, Keppra, Lipitor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is poorly organized with an mixture of theta at 5 Hz, 3-4 Hz activity and on rare occasions a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There are paroxysmal bursts and there is some prominent shift shifting slowing. Features of drowsiness include some hypersynchronous slowing. The overall background is sharply contoured particularly in the left central region. In sleep, there is frontal muscle sleep artifact. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:   96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and poor organization.
Shifting slowing.
Discrete left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.  The discrete left frontocentral discharges are quite small and may represent discrete spikes. No seizures were noted. The background slowing was previously discussed.
