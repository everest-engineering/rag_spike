CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male with right hemiparesis, change in mental status, seizure. Past history of 2 strokes.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Plavix, Dilantin, Metoprolol, Pravachol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very drowsy. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is quite slow with a mixture of theta and delta. Stimulation of the patient produces vertex waves and then the patient transitions into stage II sleep. The overall pattern is relatively low voltage. In this relatively low voltage background, there are no significant asymmetries. Stimulation of the patient produces a glimpse of an alpha rhythm and some theta activity. The alpha rhythm when present is 8. 7 Hz and then the patient transitions back into a sleep pattern.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Very limited wakefulness.
2. Mild background slowing when the patient is stimulated.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features noted in this record. A followup study when the patient is more alert is suggested to help evaluate the background. Additional recording may also be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity in this individual.
