CLINICAL HISTORY: A 38-year-old male. status post traumatic brain Injury more than a decade ago with gunshot wound to the face and orbit, the patient has had difficult to control seizures with a facial abrasion 1 month ago.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Xanax, others.
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 1D-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This was a 1-hour EEG. It was a technically satisfactory study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Breach rhythm is noted with artifacts noted in the right frontotemporal region. Sharply contoured slowing is noted as the patient becomes drowsy.
Hyperventilation clearly accentuates focal slowing In the right hemisphere with sharply contoured slowing, primarily seen from the right, and rare sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase In background slowing and of course accentuation of the focal slowing. There is disruption of faster frequency activity noted in the right frontal region in sleep. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent focal slowing noted In the right hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal region
accentuated by hyperventilation and sleep.
2. Sharply contoured slowing and rare sharp waves maximum F8/T4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with a past history of traumatic brain injury, and a focal mechanism for epilepsy.
