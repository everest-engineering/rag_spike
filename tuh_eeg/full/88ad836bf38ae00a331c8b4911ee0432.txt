CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 21-year-old male with staring spells lasting 30 seconds, associated with Wellbutrin. Evaluate for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by vertex waves with K complexes, spindles observed in stage II of sleep. Abundant stage II sleep is recorded. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
