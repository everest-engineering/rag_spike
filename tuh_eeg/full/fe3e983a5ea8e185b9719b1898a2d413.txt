History:	71 year old male with anterior MCA infarct recently discharged to rehab found to be
somnolent. Re-admitted with complete right MCA infarct. EEG to r/o sub clinical
Medications:	Heparin, Protonix
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
Background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7 Hz alpha rhythm in both hemispheres.  Background
activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present predominantly in the right fronto-temporal region.
No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory or
tactile stimuli.  HR was 84.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  There is
continuous moderate focal slowing in the right fronto-temporal region. This finding is indicative of
a focal structural lesion in this region.
