CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old right handed male with a previous left occipital hemorrhage followed by bifrontal embolic strokes this past summer. Dementia with waxing and waning mental status, but no clinical seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, many blood pressure medications.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Some sections of the record demonstrate great organization with a 10 hertz 50 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is occasional shifting slowing including left frontal, right frontal, right mid temporal. The left occipital region was relatively unaffected. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at intermediate flash frequencies.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent shifting slowing superimposed upon a relatively normal background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. Overall, given the previous infarcts, the EEG is relatively unremarkable. In comparison to a previous EEG a year ago, the focal features in the left hemisphere have significantly improved.
