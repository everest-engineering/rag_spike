CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman status post aneurysm coil July 2012.  The patient subsequently developed epilepsy 1 month later with repetitive tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and confusion. Currently seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, Zyrtec, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is a technically acceptable routine 20-minute EEG aside from T1 to 2 electrode impedances which were slightly higher than 5 kiloOhms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  The patient quickly drops into stage 2 sleep with vertex waves and spindles.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs are not available for comparison at this time. No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this record. This is patients second normal EEG.
