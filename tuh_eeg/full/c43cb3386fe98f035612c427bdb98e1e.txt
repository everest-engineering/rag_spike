CLINICAL HISTORY: A 69-year-old gentleman, who had tonic-clonic seizures 2 weeks ago, coronary artery disease, TIA, Ml.
MEDICINES:  Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed. Hyperventilation was deferred. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in background rhythmic slowing. Intermittent mixed rhythmic, arrhythmic delta activity is noted. These bursts are more sustained on the left, but are also seen intermittently on the right. The left is slightly higher amplitude than the right.
Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to intermittent focal slowing, temporal maxima, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG for this adult without epileptiform activity.  Of note, the previous EEG demonstrated a bit more focal slowing on the right in comparison to the left. These findings may be correlated with imaging.
