CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with epilepsy since age 8, admitted on the 19th with chest pain. The patient subsequently had a seizure on presentation to the ED.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate.
I NTRODUCTION: A 22-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable record with most impedances below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 hertz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta followed by POSTs and spindles in stage 2 sleep. Snore artifact was sometimes noted. Nor may also have disrupted the patient's sleep.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient had been in stage 2 sleep and minimal activates the record.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. No previous EEGs are available at this time for comparison. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be of use.
