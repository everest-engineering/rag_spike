History:	44 year old woman presents with a second convulsion.
Medications:	Asthma meds
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic


Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed   by symmetric vertex waves.

Occasional subtle polymorphic theta activity is noted over the left temporal region. It becomes more pronounced during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 22-minute EEG, awake and drowsy, due to subtle occasional mild left temporal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
