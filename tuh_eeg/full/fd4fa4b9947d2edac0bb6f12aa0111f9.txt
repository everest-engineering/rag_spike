History:	72 YO MALE WITH PACE MAKER AND DX WITH CARDIAC AMYLOID, PRESENTED
TO ED WITH SOB AND CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  There is diffuse muscle artifact almost throughout the recording.  There is excess diffuse 7
Hz theta activity during wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz
slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Beta diffuse
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Artifact, EMG diffuse
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is an abnormal and technically limited EEG due to  diffuse background slowing
and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG artifact.  If clinically indicated, suggest
repeat EEG.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present. Note the patient is tachycardic.
