CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 41-year-old woman with history of febrile convulsions, family history of epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and migraine headache.  Now with episodic feelings of disconnection, feeling hot with brief loss of consciousness, convulsive activity followed by tongue biting and incontinence.

MEDICATIONS:  Ambien, Percocet, Toprol, Zanaflex, and others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep, 24-minute EEG with impedance under 5 kilohms, with the exception of the T1 and T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak was noted.  The patient is quite drowsy transitioning to stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with rhythmic central theta followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTs.

Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response despite the fact that the patient is transitioning through stage 2 sleep.

Heart rate 72 bpm.

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study may be considered.
