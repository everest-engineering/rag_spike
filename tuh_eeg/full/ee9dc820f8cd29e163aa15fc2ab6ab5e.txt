History:	47 year old man with a history of seizures.  Patient with reportedly 6 seizures over ~
2.5 years.  Last seizure occurred about 1 year ago.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a  very low amplitude 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Low voltage
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 28-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and briefly asleep. The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
