CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old male with bilateral basal ganglia intracerebral hemorrhage with a history of atrial fibrillation on Pradaxa, hypertension, CHF, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, Diltiazem, Clonidine, Zosyn, Lovenox, Hydralazine Labetalol, Lantus
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG study shows there is a low background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Patient had no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts seen continually throughout the recording.  At times there is a frontal predominant alpha discharge at 8-10 Hz.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The frontal alpha may be seen in alpha coma due to a differentiation which suggest a moderate prognosis since there is no history of hypoxia  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
