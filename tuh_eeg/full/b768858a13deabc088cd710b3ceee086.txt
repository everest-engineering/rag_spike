History:	47 YR FEMALE WITH SZ ,SAH, MULTI ANEURYSMS CLIP RIGHT MCA AND LEFT
MCA.NOW FOR FOLLOW UP PT DENIES ANY RECENT SZ ACTIVITY.  SURGERY
6/2013.
Medications:	Keppra, Amlodipine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior and midtemporal region (F7
and T3) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. There is also an associated increased
amplitude and faster frequencies seen consistent with a breach.  At times the focal slowing is sharply
contoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left mid
and anterior temporal region.  This finding is consistent with the known surgery.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
