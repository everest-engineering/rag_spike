CLINICAL HISTORY:  61 year old right handed female, childhood epilepsy at age 6 or age 9 with extraordinarily strong positive family history of epilepsy.  Currently seizure-free for several years.  She occasionally has myoclonus in either arm and left leg weakness.  Her family has a strong family history of epilepsy, but most individuals either have absence epilepsy or have outgrown their epilepsy.  The patient has left mesial temporal sclerosis.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Zoloft, HCTZ, Actonel, Zantac, Calcium
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces rhythmic frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    90 bpm with rare APCs.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Today's EEG did not identify epileptiform features.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Comparison with this patient's previous EEGs is suggested.
