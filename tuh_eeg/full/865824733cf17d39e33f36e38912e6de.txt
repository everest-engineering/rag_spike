CLINICAL HISTORY:  76 year old female with a history of PEA code on 02/18/2012, down for 20 to 30 minutes, noted to have myoclonic jerking, recently discharged for CHF exacerbation with complaints of shortness of breath and chest tightness.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post PEA code with myoclonic jerks.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep was captured.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely low amplitude background with no clear posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is an overlying muscle artifact throughout the whole recording, making it very difficult to establish if there is any underlying electrocerebral activity.  Over the posterior electrodes there seems to be no normal cerebral activity.  After the patient is stimulated, there appears to be no change in the record.  Of note, the heart rate is about 120 beats per minute with a very wide QRS interval.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As above.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals a lack of normal electrocerebral activity; however, there is a marked amount of multi-electrode artifact which makes it difficult to
make any certain conclusions about the underlying electrical patterns.  No seizures or overt epileptiform activity were seen.
