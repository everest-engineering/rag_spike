REASON FOR STUDY: Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION OF EEG: The EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes as well as anterior temporal electrode. The recording was performed during awake and stage I sleep. Photic activation procedures including photic stimulation was performed, but no hyperventilation was performed.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan.
CLINICAL PROBLEMS: Frequent muscle artifact and mouth and tongue movement artifact.
HISTORY: A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cirrhosis, and right stroke in 2010, who presents with change in mental status and confusion, transferred for recent seizures.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: This record opens to a well-fanned 9 Hz BDR, which is reactive to eye opening and closing and some increased frontal central beta as well as some diffuse beta. Sleep is seen for a short amount of time, stage I. Activation procedures with photic stimulation did not reveal any abnormal discharges. Heart rate was 52.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow wave seen at T4 at 2 to 4Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts seen occasionally.
SEIZURES: None seen.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to bitemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is limited EEG with increased muscle artifact and movement artifact reveals evidence of right temporal cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with no known strokes. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
