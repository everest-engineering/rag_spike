CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old woman with previous left temporal bleed, tonic-clonic seizures.  Baseline left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal, Ativan, trazodone.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with generous diffuse beta.  Supra harmonic alpha rhythm is noted on some occasions at twice the frequency of the baseline alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude.
Photic stimulation produces vigorous bilateral driving.  During photic stimulation, there is a slight amplitude asymmetry, slightly higher amplitude on the left.  There also seems to be an accentuation of faster frequency activity from the left during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an unusual, but not pathological EEG.  It is considered within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The alpha harmonic, present bilaterally is a normal variant.  The prominent driving response is again a normal phenomenon as is the beta frequency activity.
The slightly more vigorous supra harmonic driving noted on the left, ipsilateral to the heterotopic tissue is not necessarily pathological and may be considered within the broad range of normal possibilities of photic response.
Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  No sharp waves or spikes were noted today.
