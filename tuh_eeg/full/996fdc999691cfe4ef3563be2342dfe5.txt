REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-woman with stroke in 2008, hypertension, seizures since 1983, status post motor vehicle accident.  She has a seizure 2 months ago, approximately every 6 to 7 months has a seizure described as loss of consciousness with generalized tonic-clonic shaking and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Motrin, Depakote, phenobarbital, atorvastatin, ranitidine, hydrochlorothiazide and mirtazapine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F8/T4 and at times at T4 while awake and sleep.  They are seen occasionally.
Focal slow waves are seen at F7-T3 and at times at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts occasionally.
Focal slow waves seen also occasionally at F8/T4 and at times at T4.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right anterior and mid temporal sharp waves with additional focal slowing in the left anterior and mid temporal region as well as in the right anterior temporal and mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right mid to anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal and mid temporal lobes, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
