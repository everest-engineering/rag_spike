History:	83 year old woman admitted with a stroke.  Patient was noted to have behaviors
concerning for seizures.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude theta>delta activity.  During arousals, there is significant diffuse EMG artifact that
obscures majority of the recording.  There is continuous paucity of faster frequencies over the right
frontotemporal region.  Sleep spindles are captured.  They are better formed over the left.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Technically limited
Artifact, EMG, frequent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal
No electrographic seizures
Asynchrony, sleep spindles, better over the left
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable technically limited (due to large amount of EMG
artifact) 22 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, continuous focal right frontotemporal
slowing and asymmetry of sleep architecture, with sleep architecture better visualized over the left.
Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the right
frontotemporal region.  Asymmetry of sleep architecture over the right suggests disruption of right
thalamocortical connections.  Due to large amount of EMG artifact, subtle abnormalities, such as
epileptiform discharges, could have been missed.  No electrographic seizures are captured.  These
findings were conveyed to the primary team.
