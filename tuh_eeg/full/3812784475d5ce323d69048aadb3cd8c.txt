HISTORY:
A 53-year-old gentleman admitted after a prolonged, 20-minute seizure with a second 10 to 15 minute seizure in the emergency room_ He received Ativan and was diagnosed in nonconvulsive status epileptic us. Features of the status epilepticus included nystagmus and right-sided weakness. Known prior stroke, epilepsy, right-sided weakness. The patient remains aphasic.
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin and others.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In apparent wakefulness, the background EEG is bilaterally slow. The left hemisphere is significantly slower than the right and Includes arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity. The right hemisphere in wakefulness is more of a low-voltage pattern w1th scant alpha and theta background. Intermittent, sharply contoured arrhythmic delta activity is identified from the left hemisphere maximum at T1 There are intermittent sharp waves noted in the record, which demonstrate variable maximum including T1, F7 and T5_ There are also some left frontal discrete spike waves, some of which appear as pairs.
Photic stimulation serves to alert the patient and elicits scant driving on the right.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Arrhythmic delta from the left hemisphere.
2. Sharp waves in the left hemisphere with variable maximum including left temporal, posterior temporal or parietal and left frontal central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The focal slowing and sharp waves are congruent with the past stroke history. The background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. There is more than one area of epileptiform activity for this subject.
