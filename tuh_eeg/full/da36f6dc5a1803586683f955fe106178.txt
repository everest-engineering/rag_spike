CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old right handed male with right-sided hemorrhage status post motor vehicle accident, presents with left-sided leg twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone, ASA, Klor-Con, Lasix, Digoxin, Cozaar, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Possible seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  This patient achieved stage 1, stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves intermittently seen at F8/T4 with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts and a frequency of 2-4 Hz.
HR:   66 bpm and at times there is a wide morphology to the complex.
SEIZURES:
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Intermittent right anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but is consistent with a known lesion.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
