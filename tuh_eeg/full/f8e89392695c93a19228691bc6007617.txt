CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old male with significant dementia, epilepsy attributed to
alcohol abuse, head trauma when the patient experienced a seizure on admission to
prison this past summer. Recent status epilepticus treated at
outpatient.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. Hyperventilation was not completed, but photic stimulation
was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
rhythmically slow pattern with an alpha rhythm of approximately 8 hertz. Features of
drowsiness include an increase in beta. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an
asymmetry with dropout of rhythmic theta frequency activity observed in the right
temporal region. Photic stimulation elicits driving, better identified on the left. The driving
response is subtle.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Superimposed intermittent subtle focal slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The subtle focal
features are congruent with the imaging findings. The rhythmic background slowing may
be part of his underlying cognitive impairment.
