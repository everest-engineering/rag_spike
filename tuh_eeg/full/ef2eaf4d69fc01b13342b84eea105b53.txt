CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old female with past medical history of end-stage renal disease, hypertension, anemia, right MCA decompression and craniotomy, who presented with slurred speech upon waking up.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Insulin, Heparin, Metoprolol, Zocor, Colace, Vancomycin.

REASON FOR EEG: Seizures.

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was unresponsive during the EEG. No activating procedures were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The records opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm, normal frontocentral beta or normal sleep architecture. No activating procedures were performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:

1. There is generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV and an asymmetry between the right and left hemisphere. There are faster frequencies noted over the left hemisphere, at best 5-7 Hz, however, this is not seen over the right hemisphere.
2. There are focal sharp waves at F3 / C3. During the recording they appear more prominent in wakefulness. After the first 2 hours they become more blunted and less sharp, later they almost disappear leaving focal slow waves.

SEIZURES: None.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slow waves.
2. Focal sharp waves in the left frontal region, later becoming blunted; but continues to become prominent during wakefulness.
3. Focal slower waves in the left centro-frontal region.
4. Lack of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.
