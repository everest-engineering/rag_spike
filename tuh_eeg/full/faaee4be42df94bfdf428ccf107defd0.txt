PMH: ASTHMA, HTN
Medications:	ELAVIL, TORADOL, ADVAIR, REGLAN, PROTONIX

electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Ambulatory EEG
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 19 hours from 01/02/14 to 01/03/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	1
Description of pushbutton events
The patient became unresponsive to verbal and motor commands for about 13 minutes while in
the bathroom. The camera was not on the patient as the event started but later at one point she is
placed on camera. She has her head down with eyes closed and appears unresponsive. The EEG
during the event remained normal.
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The episode of unresponsiveness had no EEG
correlate and likely represents a psychogenic non-epileptic event.

sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
