CLINICAL HISTORY : A 46-year-old woman with refractory complex partial epilepsy, mesiotemporal sclerosis, Prior status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS : DIVALPROEX, PHENYTOIN,ZONISAMIDE , ACETAMINOPHEN
CODEINE 3. Diazepam, Risperidone
INTRODUCTION : Video EEG was performed standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG . Photic stimulation was completed in this 20 minute routine study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:	Wakefulness included a symmetric 7.5 Hz PDR which is reactive . There is mild excess theta in the background.	Drowsiness includes an increase in theta, particularly in the temporal regions.	There is also accentuated of frontocentral beta.	Occasional Left TIRDA was noted.	Stage II sleep was characterized by by spindles
Epileptiform activity : F8 sharp waves can be identified in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep. Rare TS-01 spikes were noted in sleep and photic
Photic stimulation was completed while the patient was drifting into stage II sleep it did not substantially activate the record
Seizures:	None.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:	This technically challenging EEG was remarkable for;

Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
Excess theta
Somewhat slow alpha rhythm
Rare left posterior temporal sharp waves
CLINICAL CORRELATION:		These findings may be correlated with previous imaging and	EEG recordings, but this study supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy.
