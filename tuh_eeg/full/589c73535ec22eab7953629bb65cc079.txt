CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed woman with mental retardation, complex partial epilepsy, and gingival hyperplasia, seizure-free for the last 3 years.  This is the patient's third EEG.

MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is primarily a sleep EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low-voltage EEG but symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is abundant stage II sleep with K-complexes, spindles, posts, and vertex waves.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third normal EEG for this individual who has been seizure-free for the last 4 years.  Of note, she was previously evaluated for staring spells.  If these behaviors recur and are thought to be seizures, an ambulatory EEG recording could be considered at that time.
