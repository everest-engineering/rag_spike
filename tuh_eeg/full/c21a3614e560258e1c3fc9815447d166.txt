CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old man with a history of sudden polydipsia, polyuria after eating Thanksgiving dinner.  Found to have change of mental status and tonic-clonic seizures.  In the ER, he was found to have a glucose of 1200.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan in the ED and Keppra.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was comatose to obtunded during the recording.  Activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 2-4 Hz.  No normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta seen.  No normal sleep architecture was seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and 20-70 microvolts amplitude.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
During the recording, the patient was stimulated with noxious stimuli and there is actual improvement in the frequency to one of the theta frequency and marred muscle movement during the stimulation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The improvement in frequency during stimulation forbodes a favorable prognosis.  No seizure or epileptiform activity was seen.
