History:	46 year old man with a known seizure disorder, now presents after several
Medications:	Amitriptyline, Citalopram,  Depakote,   Ativan, Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
lethargic
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of low amplitude diffuse fast
activity.  Patient appears awake throughout the study.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 31 minute portable EEG because the normal background has
been replaced by diffuse fast activity. This could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
