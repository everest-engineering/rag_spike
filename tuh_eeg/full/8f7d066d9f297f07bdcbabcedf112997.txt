History:	77 year female with chief complaint of weakness, confusion and slurred speech.  Per
granddaughter, patient has intermittent episodes of confusion.
Medications:	Sedation recorded 7/1 total 6 MG Ativan, 75 MG Fentanyl, Tramadol, Solumedrol,
Plavix, Crestor, Insulin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
The background consists of 8 Hz theta activity posteriorly with weak AP gradient and excess diffuse
polymorphic theta and delta activity.  Patient rapidly transitions between drowsiness and arousals.
Drowsiness is characterized by poorly formed vertex waves, increase in diffuse delta activity and
period of background discontinuity.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding
is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this
patient is at least partially related to excessive drowsiness.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
