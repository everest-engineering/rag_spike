EEG LENGTH:  Almost 29 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old woman who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.  Episodes are described as onset of headache on the left side of her head followed by loss of consciousness and left-sided shaking with post-event confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications: Cardizem, venlafaxine, Xanax, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During sleep prominent POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)  symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Step photic stimulation does not result in any abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate fewer than 60 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
Heart rate less than 60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  Heart rate fewer than 60 beats a minute is noted on the single EKG lead.
