REASON FOR STUDY:  Hypoxic injury.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old man found unresponsive with carbon monoxide poisoning on December 1st, with a history of hypertension and alcohol abuse, left foot ischemia, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, bacteremia and pneumonia.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, aspirin, Lovenox, vitamins, Coreg, thiamine, vancomycin, Lipitor.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the patient's background is mainly in the theta frequently at 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  The patient does appear to be reactive to commands and there is variability in the EEG upon stimulation.  The patient did have photic stimulation which revealed no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 84.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Diffuse slow waves seen at 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but is likely related to the carbon monoxide/hypoxic injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
