CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old woman with right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage, diffuse blood in the ventricles, status post EVD.  Prior left hemispheric stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient was described as unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  The EEG opens with disorganized and slow record with shifting slowing.  There are bursts of frontal delta with left hemisphere demonstrating more irregular delta or sharply contoured delta than the right.  Although, the patient is described as unresponsive, the EEG pattern suggests that she is intermittently awake with a medium amplitude pattern and a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
Tactile stimulation was performed while the patient was in the faster frequency pattern with alpha frequency activity, and tactile stimulation produced some bursts of frontal, somewhat irregular delta.  There is some sharply contoured slowing with sharply contoured delta and potentially an underlying left frontal sharp waves noted in some of the bursts of delta.
Heart rate 102 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to
Intermittent bursts of mixed irregular and rhythmic delta.
Intermittent asymmetry with more significant focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere including sharply contoured slowing.
Intermittent arousal pattern in the patient who does not seem to be responsive.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The bihemispheric pathology may contribute to some of the features described above.  The bursts of delta noted with tactile stimulation may be part of a metabolic encephalopathy.  No seizures were recorded.  EEG suggests more awake patient than otherwise recognized.
