CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old male with episodes of bilateral hand shaking and
loss of awareness. These episodes stopped after the patient began Depakote therapy.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were preformed. This was a 1 hour sleep-deprived study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing and anterior
spread of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces a small degree of background
slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified in this
EEG nor in the previous EEG. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
