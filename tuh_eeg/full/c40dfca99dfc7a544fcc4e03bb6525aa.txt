History:	76 year old man status post right basal ganglia, requiring craniotomy, now presents
with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower
waveforms over the right.  The background over the left hemisphere consists of a mixture low-to-
moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with underriding subtle faster frequencies and frequent
EMG artifact.  The background over the right hemisphere consists of a mixture of polymorphic low
amplitude (attenuated) delta>theta activity with delta activity most prominent over the right
frontotemporal region.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is subtle increase in underriding
faster frequencies bilaterally when  visual, auditory, tactile, and noxious stimuli are applied.
Patient moves his right leg throughout the recording.  A single EKG lead demonstrates frequent
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, most pronounced over the
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 32 -minute portable EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and continuous
focal moderate-to-severe right hemispheric slowing that is most pronounced over the right
frontotemporal region. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis
of epilepsy.  Patient moves his right leg throughout the recording.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
frequent premature QRS complexes.
