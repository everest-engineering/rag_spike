CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed gentleman with refractory tonic clonic
seizures with fecal incontinence. As may as 4-5 seizures per week, sometimes
clustering.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11.7 hertz
alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is a
small amount of theta noted in the background. Hyperventilation produces an increase
in rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features observed today. Right
occipital head rocking artifact was noted. If further characterization of this individual's
epilepsy is important, a follow-up study is suggested.
