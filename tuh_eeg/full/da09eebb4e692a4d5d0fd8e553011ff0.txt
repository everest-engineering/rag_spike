INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is awake and drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is diffusely slow.  Initially, the technologist has trouble getting the patient to hold still and then the patient falls asleep with some vertex waves and spindles.  He intermittently arouses.  FIRDA is noted.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a metabolic encephalopathy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study is suggested.
