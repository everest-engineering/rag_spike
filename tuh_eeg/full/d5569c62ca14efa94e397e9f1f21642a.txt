CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right-handed woman with seizures for the last 5
years. The patient reports an aura of feeling hot then tonic/clonic seizures with loss of
consciousness, last seizure 2 weeks ago. Patient says she buys Xanax off the streets.
MEDICATIONS: Xanax.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz, 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm in a background rich in beta frequency activity. Drowsiness
is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta. Deeper
stages of sleep are not achieved. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the
record. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response with harmonic and super
harmonic driving. In addition, the patient starts to be just a bit sleepier with some
rhythmic theta at the beginning of photic stimulation.
HR: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL There are no epileptiform features. The generous beta
may be due to this patient's medications. The vigorous driving response is a normal
phenomenon.
