CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed male with epilepsy, seizure free for 20 years, now hoping to get his driver's license.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are occasional shifting asymmetries including shifting asymmetries in the alpha rhythm.  There is also some shifting, irregular delta, a bit more on the right than the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is additional shifting slowing on the left with a T1 sharp wave.  Wicket activity is also noted. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilaterally driving.
HR:    78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting asymmetries.
Left temporal focal slowing and a handful of sharp waves in this sharply contoured record noted in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  There is prominent wicket, but there are some focal temporal features noted during hyperventilation only.
