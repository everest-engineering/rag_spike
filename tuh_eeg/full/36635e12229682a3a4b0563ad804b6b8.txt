LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of an unresponsive episode associated with slurred speech.  This episode lasted approximately 15 to 20 minutes and subsequently the patient appeared disoriented.  She slowly then returned to her baseline.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, CHF, stroke, chronic renal insufficiency.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, atorvastatin, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz theta activity with a weak anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background primarily consists of a mixture of diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
Intermittent moderate right temporal slowing.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization and intermittent moderate right temporal slowing.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal right temporal slowing could be secondary to an underlying structural lesion and indicates focal cerebral dysfunction.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured.
