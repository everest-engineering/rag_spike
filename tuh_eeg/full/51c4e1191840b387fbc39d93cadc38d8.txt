CLINICAL HISTORY:á 58 year old male with cirrhosis; shortness of breath, pleural
effusion, alcoholism, withdrawal seizures, and syncope.
MEDICATIONS: Zosyn, Fentanyl, Ativan, pantoprazole, Thiamine, Folate Acid,
Tylenol, Lorazepam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is variable, but quite slow with a mixture of theta and delta. There is shifting asymmetries noted and the activity seems to be a lower voltage and a bit slower on the right, although this is an intermittent finding. With stimulation there is a bit more theta of the left. There may also be accentuation of beta activity and/or potentially a skull deformity or skull change at C3. Vertex waves are noted in sleep. There are a handful of triphasic waves.

HR: 100 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing
2. Shifting requiring clinical correlation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. This EEG supports a severe disturbance in cerebral in cerebral function as can be seen in the context of toxic or metabolic encephalopathy and/or cirrhosis.
