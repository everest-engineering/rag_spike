CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed man with history of refractory epilepsy who was seizure free for some time with a past medical history of CHF, cellulitis, diabetes, seizures, polycythemia vera, hypothyroid, prostate cancer, gout.
MEDICATIONS:  Levothyroxine, Omeprazole, Oxycodone, Acetaminophen, Heparin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep was recorded.   Photic stimulation are performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a disorganized EEG with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best is seen at 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no frontocentral beta.  Sleep characterized by stage 1.  Photic stimulation did not produce any no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at T4/T6 frequently seen in runs.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 seen frequently at 2-4 Hz and 20-60 mV amplitude.
Focal slow waves seen T4 seen occasionally.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen frequently in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves.
independent bitemporal focal slow waves.
generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy, seizures likely arising from the right posterotemporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of  independent bitemporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is not specific with regard to etiology.  Lastly, there is note of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is also not specific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
