History:	60 year old woman with a history of strokes, now scheduled to undergo right carotid
stenting.
Medications:	Insulin, Methimazole, Protonix, Coumadin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates
with eyes opening and is better formed over the right.  AP gradient is present.  During drowsiness,
the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and
the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Paucity is faster frequencies is observed over the left hemisphere.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  EMG artifact is frequent and more
prominent over the right hemisphere.  That limits interpretation of the recording over that region.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left hemispheric
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy portable 21-minute EEG due to continuous mild
left hemispheric slowing. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  EMG
artifact is frequent and more prominent over the right hemisphere.  That limits interpretation of the
recording over that region.
