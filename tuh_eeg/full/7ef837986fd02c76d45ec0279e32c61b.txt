CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old left handed woman status post resection of meningioma and craniectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Keppra, Lopressor, Levothyroxine. Norvasc, Zosyn, Fergon
REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post meningioma removal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta, although sometimes slightly increased over the right central region.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  Sleep is characterized by limited stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen very rarely over the C4/F4 region with a mild increasing amplitude associated breach.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild focal cerebral dysfunction and associated breach over the right central frontal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal central region, which is consistent with a known surgery.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
