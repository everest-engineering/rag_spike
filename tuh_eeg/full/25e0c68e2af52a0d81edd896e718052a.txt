CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old gentleman with a single Xanax withdrawal related seizure in 2009.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Xanax, Risperdal, Diastat,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. Hyperventilation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well organized, 7.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with a 7.8 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features identified in this EEG nor the prior EEG in 2009, although there is one EEG recorded in close proximity to the Xanax withdrawal that is more irritative. The characteristic features are more compatible with an Alzheimer's type dementia, left posterior temporal and parietal sharp
waves which have not been identified in the last 2 EEGs.
