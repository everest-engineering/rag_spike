CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old female with multiple seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, ASA, Ciprofloxacin
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Due to refractory status epilepticus the patient receives multiple medications, including versed drip, followed by phenobarbital. She develops hypotension with the use of versed. She is intubated and poor1y response.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG monitor continues to demonstrate repetitive spike and polyspike activity in the right posterior quadrant, including C4, T6, with spread to T4. The activity can occur in brief bursts and runs. There is some volume conduction to the left. Intermittently the pattern includes a burst suppression pattern. The activity is reviewed up until 2:00p.m. and again the polyspike activity and burst suppression pattern is noted.
Of note, although the pattern persists, by the overnight recording, with medications employed there is a much clear transition to a burst suppression pattern, particularly on the right. The left hemisphere clearly demonstrates the impact of the anesthetic medications by 2:00 p.m. with a much slower pattern.
HR: 60-104 bpm
IMPRESSION: There is no conclusion because we are still recording, but the interval impression is ongoing, refractory focal status epilepticus with a burst suppression background.
LONG TERM MONITORING TO 03/1412011
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and essentially comatose.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Keppra, Lacosamide, Vimpat
