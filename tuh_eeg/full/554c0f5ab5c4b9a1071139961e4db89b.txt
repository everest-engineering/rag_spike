ROOM NO:  785.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old male, transferred from an outside hospital for a small right intracerebral hemorrhage with midline shift.  Now, with increasing episodes of confusion and agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lipitor, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient was moving around during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG on wakefulness demonstrates a continuous pattern with rhythmic theta and delta.  Despite the muscle and eye movement artifact, there is an asymmetry and the record is somewhat slower in the right hemisphere.  There are handful of frontal sharp waves seen primarily in the left frontal region with typical morphology of a triphasic wave.  These are not as apparent on the right.
Very brief drowsiness was characterized by a decrease in movement and an increase in a more of rhythmic background.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Superimposed asymmetry with a somewhat slow pattern on the right.
A handful of left frontal sharp waves with triphasic morphology.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter in addition to a structural or functional process in the right hemisphere, which involves both gray and white matter.  The findings from the left hemisphere may represent an asymmetric triphasic waves or a frontal sharp waves.  Clinical correlation is suggested.
