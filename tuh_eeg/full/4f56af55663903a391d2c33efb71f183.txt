CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 40-year-old, right-handed woman with new onset seizures as of new year's Eve with loss of consciousness, incontinent, eyes rolling back, shaking and then a burst of heat through her body.  Past history of anxiety and depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Vistaril, Remeron, and lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20 minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement 1 channel without EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with an increase in beta.  The patient was relatively drowsy during photic stimulation, which did not activate the record.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of background slowing, EKG N/A.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG, wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
