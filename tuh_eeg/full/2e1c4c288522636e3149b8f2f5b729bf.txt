History:	78 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SYNCOPE EPISODE WITH LOC/ FALL, HIT FACE
AND HEAD. PMHX: DM, THYROID DS
Medications:	LISINOPRIL, SYNTHROID, METFORMIN, NEURONTIN, PRILOSEC, FOSAMAX,
AMARYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region (left more than
right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse, Theta
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal region (left more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition to mild  diffuse background slowing.
This finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
