CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 63-year-old gentleman with seizures associated with a fall down the stairs, loss of consciousness, and a seizure on 1/21/03.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, folate, Haldol, Depakote, Midazolam.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. This is primarily a drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, there is a 9 Hz, 30 V posterior dominant rhythm.  The background EEG is diffusely slow with excess background theta.  There is higher amplitude seen on the right as compared to the left.  As the patient becomes drowsy, a frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity is seen (FIRDA), as well as R focal slowing.
HR:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for a subject of this age due to:
Excess background theta.
Amplitude asymmetry and intermittent rhythmic slowing, right hemisphere more than left.
Occasional FIRDA as the patient becomes drowsy.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing is essentially the same as that done before and supports a diffuse disorder of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were seen.
