CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old male with dementia and 3 tonic clonic seizures in December of 2012.  Patient is still confused and has difficulty sitting still throughout the EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, Ambien, Keppra, metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was unable to cooperate with hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this EEG is remarkable for a relatively low voltage, featureless pattern in a patient who had great difficulty sitting still, was moving about and had significant chew artifact.  The tech worked diligently to console the patient in an attempt to get a better quality record and at times, there is a lower voltage, mixture of rhythmic, mixed theta delta with 2 to 6 Hz activity primarily really 2 to 4 Hz background.  There was a brief section of the record with more of a theta pattern.  The patient was unable to cooperate with photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  54 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to a previous study in December.  Neither EEG demonstrated epileptiform activity, however, epileptiform activity may not always be seen in a patient with seizures, epilepsy and Alzheimer disease.   The background is overall unchanged.
