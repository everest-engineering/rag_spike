CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 29-year-old woman with new-onset seizures occurring September 3 out of sleep with convulsions and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This EEG captured wakefulness through brief stage II of sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-defined alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Features of drowsiness include rhythmic central theta with spindles noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drowsy but did elicit a driving response.  Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if additional information is needed, an additional EEG recording may be of value.
