CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old male with a history of herpes encephalitis in October
2009.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. It,
at times, is slightly higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. The frequency is
identical, but the amplitude is approximately 25% higher on the left. Features of
drowsiness include attenuation of the background. Hyperventilation produces an
increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral
driving.

HR: 56 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG demonstrates a dramatic improvement in
comparison to the 2009 study demonstrating epileptiform activity in the right temporal
region, marked background slowing, and right temporal delta.
