REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old woman found to have confusion, slurring of her words, generalized weakness, and treated for bacterial meningitis as well as possible generalized anoxic/hypoxic injury.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, the background is consistent with delta slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times there is some intermittent intermixed theta frequencies and there are frequent periodic discharges most consistent with anterior predominant symmetric triphasic waves.  The patient was stimulated but there appears to be no clear change or __________ in the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow wave 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Periodic discharges consistent with anterior predominant symmetric triphasic waves.
Lack of reactivity to stimulation.
Seizures:  None.

Heart rate:  90 with a very elevated ST segment but regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing as well as triphasics.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology but the presence of triphasics may suggest the possibility of metabolic encephalopathy although sometimes they can be seen with hypoxic injury.  No seizures were seen.
