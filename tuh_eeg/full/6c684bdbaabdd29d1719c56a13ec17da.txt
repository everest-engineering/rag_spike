History:	49 year old man who presents after a seizure.  Patient remains confused.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  During arousals the background consists of very low
amplitude excessive fast activity and bifrontal EMG.  Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the
recording with fragmented K-complexes captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates
premature QRS complexes.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and mostly asleep 20 minute EEG due to lack of normal background
organization.  This finding is indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
