CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed gentleman, past history of bilateral craniotomies in 1980, with alcohol abuse at that time, currently in good health until this morning when had repetitive seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated.  He is moving his right side better than his left.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with a prominent breach rhythm.  There is shifting arrhythmic delta activity, which is more sharply contoured on the right compared to the left.  The right seems to have more of a breach rhythm, the left more of a lower voltage slow pattern.  With breach rhythm on the right, there was accentuation of beta frequency activity.  There was also EKG artifact, but there appeared to be some sharp waves noted from the right as well.  The patient's transitions in and out of sleep state.  When he seems to be a little sleepy, there is a bit more beta.  Stimulation of the patient produces eye movement in an each recent faster frequency activity on the left.
HR:    110 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Prominent breach rhythm with prominent beta asymmetry.
Sharp waves from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric pattern with a breach on the right more than the left and sharp waves on the right.  No seizures were identified.
