HISTORY: A 31-year-old woman with recent eclampsia/PRES syndrome and seizures, now seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS: ? Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm which is reasonably high amplitude exceeding 100 mcV at times but
averaging 70 to 100 mcV. There is a small amount of underlying stages noted in the background. The amplitude of EEG is somewhat higher on the left compared to the right.
Features of drowsiness including an increase in beta followed by vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
IMPRESSION:

This EEG is remarkable for mild excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:

There is rare shifting slowing in sleep compatible with movement during arousal. overall, the background theta has markedly improved. No FIRDA was noted. No epileptiform features were observed. overall, for this individual who may be on Tegretol,
this EEG demonstrates an improving pattern.
