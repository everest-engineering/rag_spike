History:	24 year old woman with a history of seizures since 10 years old.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is briefly performed and stopped at the patient's request, producing no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces a minimal symmetric photic
driving response.  HR is 60.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 41-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
