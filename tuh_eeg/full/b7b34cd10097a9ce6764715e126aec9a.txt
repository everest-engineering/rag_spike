CLINICAL HISTORY:  32 year old right handed woman with adult onset epilepsy, long history of depression with a past suicide attempt, now increasingly depressed.  Occasional tonic clonic seizures and rare daily space-out spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient seemed to be very drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The vast majority of the EEG includes stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Brief wakefulness includes a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous low voltage frontal central beta activity.  The patient was falling asleep during hyperventilation.  She was asleep during photic stimulation, but a scant, photic driving response was noted.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG primarily in stage II sleep.
CLINICAL COURSE:  This is the second normal EEG for this young adult.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  With 2 normal EEGs, consideration for long term EEG session capturing one of her spells is suggested.
