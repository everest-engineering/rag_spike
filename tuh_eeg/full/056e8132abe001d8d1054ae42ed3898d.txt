INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic frontal central theta, followed by vertex waves.  K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS in stage II sleep.  The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation was not performed.
HR:    66 bpm
