CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 41-year-old woman with new-onset seizures, September 2014, characterized by screaming, shaking, tongue biting, and amnesia. This event followed alcohol and cocaine ingestion, and Xanax use.
MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Singulair, Flonase, Prilosec, and others.
INTRODUCTION: One-hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Mu activity was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this. There is a small amount of underlying theta in the posterior regions bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta as well as attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness appears in the transition in and out of sleep. Stage 2 sleep was characterized by spindles. There may be underlying snore arousals. Hyperventilation produced an increase in theta.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was falling asleep. There was a photic driving response noted.  In addition, rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness with a characteristic 5 Hz activity was noted during photic stimulation.
Heart rate 60 to 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and a brief stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness is a normal variant.  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  The patient appears to be quite drowsy with frequent arousals and snoring. Clinical evaluation may be of value.
