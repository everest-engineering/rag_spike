CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old woman with extensive past medical history who had seizures with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion, last had seizures in 2010.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Methadone, Fosamax, ASA, Colace, Coumadin, Tapazole, Multi-vitamin, Prilosec, Zocor, Motrin, Advair.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient. During drowsiness shifting bitemporal independent, synchronous theta, and delta activity are captured.  No stage II sleep is recorded. Hyperventilation is not performed. During photic stimulation symmetrical occipital driving is observed.  Irregular heart rate is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Cardiac arrhythmia.
Shifting bitemporal slowing during drowsiness.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG.  Shifting bitemporal slowing during drowsiness is not considered abnormal in patient's of this age.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical suspicion for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Cardiac arrhythmia is captured on a single EKG lead.
