LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.
HISTORY:  Patient is a 31-year-old woman who had a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion approximately 1 week ago.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, iron, vitamin D, birth control.
INTRODUCTION:  Conditions of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  EEG was performed in the laboratory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-1/2 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with fluctuating effort since patient is falling asleep despite EEG technologist's effort.
Hyperventilation produces no significant change in the background.   Step photic stimulation is performed while patient is asleep and results in no occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on the routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
