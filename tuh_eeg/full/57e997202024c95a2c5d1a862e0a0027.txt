CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old male, found down on the 14th with profound hypoglycemia, areas of skin breakdown, rhabdomyolysis, and persistently unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat, lisinopril, vancomycin, Zosyn, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
TECHNICAL:  This patient was in isolation due to fomites.  Consequently, the EEG machine was placed some distance from the patient and gloving and gowning was necessary to stimulate the patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes rhythmic delta with FIRDA.  There are occasional triphasic waves noted in the EEG as well as shifting slowing.  Intermittent attenuations were noted.
Tactile stimulation of the patient on some occasions produced an alerting response with eye movement.  On some but not all occasions, tactile stimulation clearly reduced the FIRDA.  There is a handful of left frontal sharp waves noted in the record.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a markedly slow pattern.
FIRDA.
Triphasic waves.
Intermittent attenuations.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  A toxic or metabolic process or a deep brain stem process may contribute to this.  No clinical seizures were noted.  In contrast to the previous EEG, this patient was
not as responsive to tactile stimulation, but there was certainly evidence of responsivity and variability.
