CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed woman with previous craniotomy, brain tumor surgery, headaches, skull defect. A prominent craniotomy defect is noted.
MEDICATIONS: Namenda, Xanax, Ambien, Prozac, Dilantin, Percocet, Metformin, Phenylephrine (?), Simvastatin, Tricor, Warfarin, Digoxin, Metoprolol, Diovan, Furosemide, Atenolol, ISOSORBIDE, Spironolactone, Prilosec, Percocet
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm identified which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. In the transition from drowsiness to wakefulness, there is some shifting asymmetry and, at times, some of the rhythmic frontal theta may be a bit more prominent in the left frontal region or the right.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess frontal slowing when maximally awake.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The focal features described above may be correlated with imaging. The patient's bilateral craniotomy may mitigate the amplitude of the features described above.
