Medications:	KEPPRA,LASIX,MIRTAZAPINE,HEPARIN,INSULIN ZOFRAN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry of the amplitude with attenuation over the
right hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 60  Technical difficulties: The
impedances were elevated over the right hemisphere electrodes and could not be fixed by the
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right frontal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin. The
attenuation may imply cortical damage or a fluid collection in the region. Please note however
that the impedances were high over the region. In addition,  there is diffuse background slowing
and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
