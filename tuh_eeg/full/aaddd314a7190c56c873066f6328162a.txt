CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old lady with a history of 2 seizures 5 years ago.  She also has left-sided weakness.  She has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and a stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz frequency in the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  The background is symmetric.  Intermittently, there is left temporal focal slowing with a mixture of theta and delta activity, sharply contoured at times, lasting less than 3 seconds in duration.
Drowsiness is characterized by diffuse slowing and an increase in the left temporal slowing.
Hyperventilation accentuates the left temporal focal slowing.
Photic stimulation elicits mild driving.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to intermittent left temporal focal slowing, sharply contoured at times.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the left temporal lobe.
