History:	53 year old woman with new onset episodes of right arm shaking.
Medications:	Lorazepam, Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours. Nursing-initiated event buttons were
correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG was available at the
bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by trained nurses and EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the ICU monitoring technician or clinical neurophysiology fellow and the
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
The background is generally attenuated but there is a low amplitude 8-9Hz posterior dominant
rhythm.  Stage II and III sleep were seen.
On several occasions e.g., 8:38PM, 8:45PM, 8:53PM, there is a rhythmic and rapid buildup of
spikes over the left hemisphere, maximal at F3-C3, spreading to the entire left hemisphere,
culminating in an electrographic seizure lasting 50-60 seconds.  During each seizure, the patient is
seen to look around aimlessly and there is subtle shaking of the right hand.  There are intermittent
spikes seen over the left frontotemporal region.
Summary of Findings:
Seizure, occasional, left frontotemporal
Spikes, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24 hour video EEG due to recurrent seizures emanating from the left fronto-
temporal region. The seizure suggest a highly irritative focus, likely associated with a structural brain
lesion in the left frontotemporal region.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
