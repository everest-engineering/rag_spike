HISTORY: 54 YR OLD MALE  PRESENTS WITH H/0 ETOH ABUSE FOUND DOWN, ASYSTOLE TO V-FIB SHOCKED AND INTUBATED IN FIELD. PMHX SIG FOR ETOH DRUG ABUSE. BIPOLAR
MEDICATIONS:
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
TECHNIQUE: international 10-20 System: standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There Is a diffuse burst suppression pattern characterized by severe amplitude suppression interposed with bursts of high amplitude generalized sharp waves. There is also intermittent rhythmic muscle artifact suggestive of myoclonus . There is no normal background activity. There is no normal sleep activity. No focal abnormalities. Bursts of high amplitude sharp waves are seen in the frontocentral regions. There is no response to activation procedures. Burst-suppression pattern, intermittent Sharp waves, bilateral frontal.
INTERPRETATION: This is a markedly ABNORMAL baseline EEG exhibiting attenuation and a burst suppression pattern. Burst-suppression is seen in severe diffuse structural brain injury. The repetitive bursts of muscle activity likely correspond to myoclonic jerks seen in this patient. The patient will be connected to longÂ·
Need longterm EEG monitoring for further evaluation.
