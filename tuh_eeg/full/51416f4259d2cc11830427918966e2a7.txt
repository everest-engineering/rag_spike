CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 57-year-old right-handed woman who was admitted for left posterior parietal ischemic stroke on 1/12/14..  The patient continues having episodes of confusion and blurry vision.  Evaluated for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, oxycodone, insulin and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel.  Seizure and spike detection software was used.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were identified.  This was a technically acceptable EEG capturing in wakefulness and sleep.
In wakefulness, it is characterized by a dynamic pattern.  Some sections are very well organized and are notable for continuous focal slowing in the left posterior quadrant and left occipital sharp waves.  Evidence of an alpha rhythm was noted on the right and the right is well organized.
In addition, in apparent wakefulness there was frontal predominant delta   FIRDA were noted.
Sleep was characterized by vertex waves and spindles.  In sleep, the epileptiform activities persistent and the sharp waves are more polyphasic and roundly contoured.  Sleep was not sustained.  Fast activity was noted in the left occipital region in sleep and  Hz activity in the left occipital region in sleep, following sharp waves.
Seizures:  None.
Epileptiform activity:  Left occipital sharp waves, polyspikes and 10 Hz activity.
Heart rate 78 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal 24-hour EEG monitor due to:
Left focal slowing.
Sharp waves mainly in the left posterior quadrant.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  Epileptiform activity was decreasing at the end of the monitoring session and no seizures were recorded. FIRDA is a nonspecific finding, noted in  many conditions including metabolic encephalopathy
