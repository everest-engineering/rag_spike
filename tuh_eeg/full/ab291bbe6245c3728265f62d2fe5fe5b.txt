CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed woman with complex partial epilepsy
and learning disability. Currently she has no major seizures but sometimes has
episodes when she wakes up in the morning, stares briefly and may be a bit tremulous.
Events last seconds. They only occur when she gets up too quickly.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal, Paxil, Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of frontal theta and
there is a subtle asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic, left frontotemporal theta on the left
compared to the right. Hyperventilation produces an increase in bilateral slowing and
slightly accentuates the asymmetry in the frontocentral frontotemporal region.
Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in
beta. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 66 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing from the left frontocentral frontotemporal region.
2. A small amount of excess frontotemporal and frontocentral theta.
CORRELATION: These findings were seen in a previous EEG. No left
temporal sharp waves were noted in today's study, however.
