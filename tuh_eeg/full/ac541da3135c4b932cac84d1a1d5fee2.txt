CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed female with seizure disorder. Seizure free for 25 years. Breast cancer 6 years ago. Now requiring full check up.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10
Hz alpha rhythm. On rare occasions there is a small amount of rhythmic slowing in the
left or right temporal region. This may be identified independently or bilaterally.
Hyperventilation produces an Increase in amplitude, as well as occasional bursts of
sharply contoured slowing from the right or left temporal region. Features of drowsiness include a spread of the alpha rhythm, followed by occasional bursts of frontally
predominantly delta, and then vertex waves. Photic stimulation is remarkable for some twitch artifacts, as well as a driving response. The patient starts to drift into stage I and II sleep with photic stimulation with K-complexes and posts.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
I. Occasional bursts of right or left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features are identified. Background
slowing described as above is a nonspecific fin ding and can be seen in the context of ischemic cerebrovascular disease or in individuals that have history of epilepsy.
