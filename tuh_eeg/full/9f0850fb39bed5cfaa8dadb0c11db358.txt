CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 93-year-old woman with recurrent episodes of word finding difficulties.
MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, lisinopril, and Zocor.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is a technically acceptable routine EEG with impedances under 20 kilos with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is occasional, shifting right or left temporal theta or delta.  Deeper stages of sleep include vertex waves.  K complexes were noted in stage 2 sleep.
In maximal wakefulness, the EEG is unremarkable for age.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep.  Scant driving response was noted.
Heart rate irregular 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted.  A subject of this age is permitted a small amount of theta-delta in the transition to sleep. This is similar to the patientâ€™s recent (also normal) EEG
