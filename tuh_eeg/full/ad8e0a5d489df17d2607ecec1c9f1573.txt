INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a brief sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha is reactive with eye closure.  Abundant frontocentral beta is noted in relaxed wakefulness and early drowsiness.  She goes into stage I sleep.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Photic stimulation causes supraharmonic driving.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG for this adult with a history of epilepsy.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
