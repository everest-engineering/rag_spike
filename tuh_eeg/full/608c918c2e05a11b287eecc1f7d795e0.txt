CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old male with polysubstance abuse found unresponsive with 3 seizures on February 4, HIV positive, deaf, unable to follow commands.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, ampicillin and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow and lacks some of the developmental milestones of an awake adult, including alpha rhythm.  It is more of a lower voltage featureless pattern.  Stimulation of the patient produces beta and theta.  THERE IS A HIGH AMPLITUDE SHARP WAVE IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE.  Sometimes this has the typical morphology of a higher amplitude sharp wave.  On other occasions it appears more as a periodic complex with variable maximum in the right hemisphere and can be maximum mid temporal, anterior temporal or occasionally posterior.  The patient wakes up and is talking, at which point there is a bit fore beta noted in the background.  On some occasions there is almost a positivity within the lateral temporal chain.  All of the epileptiform discharges clearly involve T4 and T2, however.
Heart rate 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG primarily in drowsiness, but wakefulness and drowsiness due to:
Marked background slowing.
A relatively featureless pattern.
Periodic complex in the right hemisphere with some sharp waves or periodic discharges noted in wakefulness and sleep without frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG suggests of focal mechanism for seizures, as well as a relatively irritative process for a patient 2 days following repetitive seizures. No clinical seizures were recorded.  If additional information is needed, a follow-up study in the lab may be considered.
