CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old woman, right handed woman, with diabetes, who presented to the emergency room with gastroenteritis and lightheadedness, and then went on to have right arm twitching.  Sometimes the patient experienced right arm numbness, head rocking, and right arm shaking.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, pravastatin, metformin, others.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of an awake and drowsy state, 14 and 6, 14, and 6 was noted symmetrically in the frontal regions on rare occasions in that transition.

The technologist performed testing for the patient to make sure that the patient was able to be awake and alert.  With cognitive testing, a normal awake EEG pattern was noted.

The patient has an episode of hand tremulousness.  The patient remains awake, alert, conversant with the technologist.  In addition, the EEG pattern during this twitch demonstrates a well organized, well defined normal awake pattern.

Very brief epochs of stage II sleep were recorded.  The patient was not observed to have any involuntary movements in sleep.

At 1:40 p.m. the patient had an episode of head rocking from side to side.  This was not associated with a change in the EEG, although it did produce some tremulousness.

Heart rate:  90 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake through brief stage II sleep





CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient demonstrated 2 motor behaviors during the EEG.  The first was tremulousness of the hand, the second was head rocking from side to side.  Neither of these carried an EEG signature.  Correlation with this patient's clinical picture and imaging is suggested.
