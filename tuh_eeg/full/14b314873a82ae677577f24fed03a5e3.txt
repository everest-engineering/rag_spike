CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 8. Tonic clonic seizures with postictal confusion, depression and asthma.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Seroquel, Xanax, Losepine, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness produces an increase in beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record also accentuating beta as well as some theta. Deeper states of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response particularly of faster flash frequency.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG for this adult. If additional information is needed to characterize this individual's epilepsy, a follow-up study is suggested.
