CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old male presents ascending aortic dissection, global ischemia, encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: Clonazepam, Lamictal, Flomax, ASA, Flagyl, Zosyn, Vanco.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency slow pattern with a mixture of theta, delta, and theta frequency activity. Acceptable auditory and tactile stimulation for this critical care patient were not performed.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Moderately severe generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, however, to appropriate prognostic implications adequate auditory and tactile stimulation should be performed.
