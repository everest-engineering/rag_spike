CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old gentleman with recurrent syncope episodes for the
last 2 years, past history of gunshot wound to the face in 1973 and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lovenox, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation is performed.
This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hertz 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. There is prominent frontal beta and only a small amount of
rhythmic frontal theta left more so than the right. As the patient becomes drowsy,
arrhythmic delta activity is observed with some shifting slowing but the arrhythmic delta
activity is a bit more prominent in the right as the patient becomes drowsy and then later
on there is lower voltage rhythmic delta in the left anterior temporal region. In
drowsiness there are rare right anterior temporal sharp waves. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm with a broad QRS complex noted in a single lead EKG.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Arrhythmic delta activity in the right temporal region.
2. Rhythmic delta from the left temporal region.
3. Rare (2) right anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. No
seizures were recorded. This EEG supports a bi-hemispheric process and may be
compatible with pathophysiology of this individual's head trauma.
