CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old right handed woman with a history of motor vehicle accident and right hip fracture with bone fusion with loss of consciousness, had 2 stimuli episodes since 1989, hypertension, bacteriuria, and asthma.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, Metoprolol, Bromide, Levothyroxine, Vancomycin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta. Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Intermittent focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
