:
History:	36 year old female with a history of epilepsy since age 12 years. Last seizure was
generalized and occurred on 5/26/14.  PMH of hydrocephalus, restless leg
syndrome, ADHD, migraine.  Patient is currently pregnant.
Medications:	Keppra, Levothyroxine, Strattera, Adderall
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  Patient remains awake throughout
No clear focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at various flash rates.  Frequent movement is noted throughout
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, movement, frequent
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only EEG.  No clear epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. There is frequent movement artifact, so subtle changes/ abnormalities
might have been missed.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
