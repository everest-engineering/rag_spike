History:	91 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Now that she is off her AEDs, she
reportedly has daily nocturnal convulsions.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Additional polymorphic delta activity is noted over the right temporal
region during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate <60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 24 minute EEG due to intermittent moderate focal left
temporal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The degree of right temporal slowing that is captured
during drowsiness is considered normal in patients over the age of 65 years old  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate
