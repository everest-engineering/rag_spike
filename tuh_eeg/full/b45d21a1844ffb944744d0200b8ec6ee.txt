CLINICAL HISTORY:  30 year old left handed man with history of HIV and hypertension, presents with right ear pain, episode of shaking, bladder incontinence as well as headache, found to have meningitis and ocular pressure.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Labetalol, Amphotericin, Keppra, Percocet, Lidocaine and Flucytosine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of shaking and bladder incontinent and having meningitis, concern for seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is some continuous movement artifact and eye movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7-8 Hz.  There is some frontocentral beta that can be seen.  No sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.  In general, the backgrounds consists of delta more than theta frequencies seen diffusely throughout the recording during wakefulness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz and at times 2-4 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild-to-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  It may be due at least in part to medication or a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
