CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old well woman of unknown handedness, status post lapchole, past history of hemorrhagic stroke with craniectomy and EVD, history of right frontal subdural hematoma, left frontal ventriculostomy, pneumatocele, large intra-axial right frontal hematoma with vasogenic edema and shift of 11 mm.   Cholecystectomy was August 2nd.  The patient admitted on August 24th for above complaints.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Reglan, Lipitor, phenytoin, mannitol, and hydralazine.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a markedly abnormal pattern within intra-hemispheric asymmetry.  From the right hemisphere, the EEG is medium amplitude with a mixture of theta and smaller amounts of beta frequency activity.  It is somewhat slower in the right frontal central region and there is clear attenuation of faster activity in the right frontal central region.  The left hemisphere demonstrates a higher amplitude pattern, congruent with the breach rhythm.  There are sharply contoured slowing.  In addition to the breach rhythm, there is a T1/F7phase reversal and occasional left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves and some FP1 and F7 as well.  There is intermittent exaggeration of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere, but no definitive seizures.
Heart rate:  110.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A slower pattern noted on the right with right frontal slowing.
Sharply contoured slowing with sharp waves noted in the left frontal and temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, congruent with neuroimaging.  There are sharp waves in this record for a comatose patient, EEG monitoring may be of value.
