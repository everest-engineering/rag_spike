History: 61 YR MALE WITH CC OF EPISODE OF CONFUSION AND SHAKING. EYES ROLLED BACK NOT FOLLOW COMMANDS. POST CONFUSION AND DISORIENTATION
HEAD 59 CM. PMHX: CABG, HTN, OM, PVD, GOUT
Medications: Insulin, Labetalol, ASA, Amiodipine
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine. awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake , photic
DESCRIPTION:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. During drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent. and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes Intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region (F7/T3 z FSIT4) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. There are two sharp transients seen over the right anterior temporal region which are suspicious.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate bilateral temporal Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse Interpretation.
This EEG reveals evidence of independent focal cerebral dysfunction In the bilateral anterior temporal region, which is non-specific with regards to etiology. In addition there Is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which Is also non-specific with regards to etiology. The sharp transients are suspicious for an epileptic foci of irritability. Repeated EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep may help in clarifying the diagnosis.
