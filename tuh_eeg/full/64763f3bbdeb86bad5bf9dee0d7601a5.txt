CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old woman with COPD, renal failure, respiratory difficulty, difficult speaking, and tachycardia.

MEDICATIONS: ASA, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is sitting up, uncomfortable. She has an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of 8 Hz activity. Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm. She has brief vertex waves and then spontaneous arousals. Photic stimulation elicits: Scant driving. The patient transitions in and out from wakefulness, or stage 2 sleep, throughout the record.
HR: 120-150 and irregular
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Small amount of 8 Hz activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In view of the patient's respiratory distress, the findings described above are quite unremarkable. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat test may be obtained when the patient is more comfortable. In addition, given the respiratory difficulties, evaluation for either sleep deprivation or obstructive sleep apnea may be important.
