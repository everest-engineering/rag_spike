History: 73 YR OLD MALE WITH PRIOR EEG PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP. PT LAST SZ X 2
WEEKS AGO w/Loc LASTING 15-20 MIN HEN BACK TO BASELINE. PMHX SIG FOR
OLD HEAD TRAUMA X 10-20 YRS AGO.
Medications: Lamictal
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine. awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically
with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity Is present. Maximal over bilateral frontal regions.
During drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness.
Increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. HR 54with some PVCs
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal
region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but
possibly structural in origin.
