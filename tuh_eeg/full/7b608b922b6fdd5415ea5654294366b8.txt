CLINICAL HISTORY: A 43-year-old male with teenage onset, refractory tonic-clonic seizures with recent severe tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal 600 mg per day, Keppra on hold.
INTRODUCTION:  EEG monitoring continuous using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  No seizures were noted by the patient, computer or clinical team.  Some sections of this record includes single electrode artifact in the left frontocentral region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is at times a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but at other times excessive, diffuse background theta was noted.  The theta is typically 6-7 hertz in frequency.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  Sleep was fragmented.
In the overnight section of the record, although there are some electrode issues, there is a slight suggestion of shifting asymmetry with perhaps some disruption of theta from the left frontocentral region relative to the right.
Epileptiform Detections:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate: 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This section of the record was remarkable for excess theta, but no epileptiform features were identified.
