CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old woman with Churg-Strauss syndrome, recent diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures with recurrent hospitalizations at multiple institutions, repetitive convulsive activity today without postictal impairment of awareness.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, topiramate, levetiracetam, Solu-Medrol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm of 30 microvolts, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a fair amount of frontocentral beta as well as muscle.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.
EKG lead N/A.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Long term video EEG was planned, but the family withdrew consent, and the patient was discharged.
