CLINICAL HISTORY:  96 year old female found to have an episode of starting and body twitching with loss of consciousness with a history of pacemaker and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril.
REASON FOR EEG:  Episode of loss of consciousness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures with photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5-9 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 50 mV.  There is a slight asymmetry over the faster frequencies that are seen over the left hemisphere, than the right hemisphere.  Wakefulness in stage I and stage II were captured.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen infrequently at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal region seen infrequently.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
