History:	70 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF CVA LEFT 10 YRS AGO. PT STATES SHE HAS
AUDIBLE SZS  SHE HEARS NOISES HAPPENING ALMOST EVERY DAY.  SHE
STATES SHE CAN STILL COMMUNICATE DURING THESE EVENTS.
Medications:	Topiramate, Divalproex, Xanax
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior and midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At times it became monomorphic consistent with
TIRDA.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal
slowing in the left anterior and midtemporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes
per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left frontotemporal
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior and midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically non-specific.  The left TIRDA has an high correlation with epileptiform activity
arising from that region.  No seizures were seen.
