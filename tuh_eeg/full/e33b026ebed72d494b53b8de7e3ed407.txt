REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures, change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 78-year-old woman who has a history of small bowel obstruction, history of Parkinsonism, hypertension, diabetes, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, ropinirole, guaifenesin, heparin, lisinopril, trihexyphenidyl, primidone, famotidine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while mildly responsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches, at best, 7 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures are not performed.  No normal sleep architecture can be seen.
Heart rate 66.
Abnormal discharges:  Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz while awake, seen continuously throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
