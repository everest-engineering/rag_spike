PATIENT PUSH BUTTON â€“ TIME 23:19:13: The patient pushes the alarm.  The video is interpretable, pre and post. The EEG shows an awake pattern.  No epileptiform activity is seen in association with the activity. There is no poly spike and slow wave activity and in reviewing the video there is no myoclonus.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  K complexes and spindles are seen in stage II sleep.
The major epileptiform activity is identified in stage II sleep with frontally predominant poly spike and slow wave activity.  This activity can be reviewed with multiple montages and appears in the frontocentral regions.  On the whole, it is symmetric in the frontal regions with the onset essentially equivalent in the frontal regions without evidence of lateralization.  The epileptiform activity can be reviewed at a slow paper speed, with an average montage but again appears to be symmetric.  Although the patient is under the covers, no motor activity is seen in association with this activity.
No seizures were recorded during this 24-hour period.
