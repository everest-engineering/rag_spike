22 YO MALE W/ HX OF SZ IN CHILDHOOD CONTROLLED WITH LUMINAL. SZ WENT AWAY UNTIL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE EVENTS CAME BACK AS GTC LASTING 5 - 8 MIN.
LUMINAL
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background  is characterized  by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy . No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
