CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right handed woman with two seizures since the age of 17. Her last seizure was October 6 after ingestion of beer.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Head rocking artifact is noted. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at faster flash frequencies. Brief drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of alpha rhythm.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
