CLINICAL HISTORY: 65-year-old male with history of seizures, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, CAD had seizures two weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, aspirin, Coreg, Tricor, Zocor, and meclizine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the record is well organized with alpha of 8 to 11 Hz. Later on there is bilateral paroxysmal slowing and some bursts of shifting slowing which could be a feature of early drowsiness. Also in early drowsiness, it becomes quite disorganized. As the patient gets more drowsy, there is generalized slowing. Photic stimulation shows some scant driving.
Heart rate 80 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing and some paroxysmal slowing and shifting slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The background slowing and disorganized pattern is nonspecific and appears as a feature of early drowsiness in a 65-year-old man.
