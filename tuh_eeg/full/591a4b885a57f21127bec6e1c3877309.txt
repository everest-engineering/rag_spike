CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed man, assaulted with a history of alcohol abuse and also change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Lorazepam, Serax, Thiamine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The record includes the patient awake and during drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG is characterized by an overall well organized symmetric background of around 11 Hz with some bursts of beta activity, more in the left. As the record continues, there is generous beta activity. During drowsiness, there is the presence of excess beta. As the patient transitions to sleep there is the presence of POSTS in addition to beta spindles. Photic stimulation generates activity driving response to 10 Hz.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta, mostly in sleep pattern.
2.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The alpha rhythm and the generous beta may be associated with medications. If epilepsy is a concern, perhaps a follow-up study is recommended.
