Medications:	KEPPRA,LISINOPRIL,ZOSYN, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE METOPROLOL, VANCO.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
medium voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient
of frequencies.  There were occasional bursts of frontally intermittent rhythmic delta activity
(FIRDA), 1.5 -2 Hz in frequency lasting 1-2 seconds.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontotemporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), occasional
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing, absent alpha rhythm, and
occasional bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  FIRDA bursts could
also be seen in increased intracranial pressure or diencephalic midline brain mass. Clinical
correlation is recommended.  Intermittent focal slowing in the right frontotemporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
