EEG REPORT
CLINICAL 26 year old right handed woman with epilepsy following MVA and
craniotomy. last seizure: November 10th. This Is her 3rd EEG.
Keppra
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz of identified
bilaterally. There is an asymmetry noted on the right compared to the left. on the right is
a higher amplitude in comparison to the left and there is some slowing from the right including
disruption of after-frequency activity and the presence of theta. Hyperventilation is performed
ear1y on in the record producing an increase in theta bilaterally.  As the patient
becomes drowsy, the asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres become a bit more prominent with
drop out of faster frequent activity on the right and a bit more right-sided theta. There Is also
some subtle sharply contoured waveforms but no definitive centrotemporal region. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR;. 60 bpm
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with both disruption of faster frequent and some
rhythmic theta.
2. There are some sharply contoured waveforms but no definitive spikes.
CLINICAL This is the patient's third EEG. The first EEG in 2007
demonstrated anterior temporal sharp waves. This EEG some subtle abnormal lies but no
definitive sharp waves or spikes in terms of epileptiform activity.
