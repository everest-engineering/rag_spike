CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old woman admitted on 11/9 with delirium, hypoxic respiratory failure, confusion. Now with posturing following intubation.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Fentanyl, Aspirin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and somewhat responsive.

OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a diffusely slow, mixed frequency pattern. There is generous beta activity. There is also some alpha frequency activity. There is intermittent, arrhythmic delta activity with shifting slowing noted from either hemisphere. The arrhythmic delta activity is relatively prominent in the posterior regions.

HR: 120 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing particularly in the temporal regions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes including underlying ischemic white matter disease and/or metabolic process. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be performed.
