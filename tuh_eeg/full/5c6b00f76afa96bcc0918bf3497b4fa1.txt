DURATION OF STUDY:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 59-year-old woman with past medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, HIV, hepatitis C, who presents to the hospital having visual and auditory hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Nifedipine, glipizide, metformin, Cymbalta, Plavix, Bactrim, HIV medications, lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During very brief drowsiness, intrusions of theta and delta activity is captured.
Hyperventilation produces no change in the background.
Photic stimulation results in minimal symmetrical occipital driving at higher flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 21-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
