History:	35 year old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 12 yo.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm is weak and reaches 8-9 Hz polymorphic low-to-moderate amplitude
activity.  AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess theta and beta activity is present.  During drowsiness,
EMG attenuates, and bursts of diffuse delta activity are captured.
Bilateral, right>left, nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity, at times rhythmic, is captured over
the bitemporal regions.  Frequent moderate right anterior temporal sharp waves are present.  These
are 80 millisecond, 100-150 uV sharp waves with a stereotyped diphasic morphology, seen
maximally over F8/T2 leads.  Occasional independent left anterior temporal, T3 maximal, sharp
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Beta, excessive
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, moderate, right temporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, left temporal
Sharp waves, frequent, right temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, occasional, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22-minute portable EEG due to (1) mild diffuse slowing
and disorganization; (2) bilateral, right>left, focal temporal slowing and (3) bilateral independent
anterior temporal epileptiform discharges, right>>>left. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Bilateral bitemporal slowing and
independent anterior temporal epileptiform discharges, right>>left, indicate focal structural
abnormalities over the bitemporal regions with increased epileptogenic potential.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
