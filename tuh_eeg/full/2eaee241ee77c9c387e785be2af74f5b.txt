History:	31 year old man with seizures
Medications:	Klonopin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
During maximal arousal the posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 9.5-10 Hz alpha
activity that attenuates symmetrically with eye closing.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep,
the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles appear.
Patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness to drowsiness and sleep.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute awake and mostly asleep EEG. Patient rapidly transitions from
wakefulness to drowsiness and sleep.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does
not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
