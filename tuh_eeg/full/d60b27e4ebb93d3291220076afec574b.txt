DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen diffusely.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Sleep was recorded in stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
