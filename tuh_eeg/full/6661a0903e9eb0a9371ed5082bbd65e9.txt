History:	51 year old man who presents with multiple generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.
Glucose was close to 800 at the time of presentation.
Medications:	Ativan 2 mg.  Propofol drip
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR and no AP gradient.  With maximal stimulation the background consists of diffuse
polymorphic slow delta activity with underriding low amplitude fast activity.  During periods of
quiescence, the background consists of bursts of polymorphic theta and delta admixed with frequent
periods of discontinuity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, right frontal
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 27 minute EEG due to severe diffuse slowing, periods of discontinuity and
continuous severe right frontal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but in this patient is at least partially related to the
medication effect.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin and could represent post-ictal
