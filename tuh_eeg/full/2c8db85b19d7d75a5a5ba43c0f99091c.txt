CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed woman with a tonic clonic seizure after Benadryl ingestion.
MEDICATIONS: Prozac, Lamictal, Abilify, Wellbutrin, Adderall, Fentanyl patch, Motrin, Caffeine, Loratadine, B12, Vitamin C.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.7 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of excess background theta. There is a slight amplitude asymmetry noted in the left parietal occipital region. Hyperventilation produces generous background rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing followed by vertex waves and then POSTS and stage I sleep.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. A suggestion of an amplitude asymmetry noted in the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. The excess theta may be due to this patient's medication. The amplitude asymmetry with a bit of head rocking in the left posterior quadrant may be correlated with imaging.
