CLINICAL HISTORY:  82 year old woman with glioma versus encephalitis, patient found on the floor on the 12th.  The patient with a baseline poor mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is confused at baseline.  She is frequently taking off her EEG electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow.  There is arrhythmic delta from the left temporal region.  The left temporal region demonstrates sharp waves or spikes at F7, FT1, T3, or T1. There are some points with some periodic sharp waves.
Although this is challenging data to interpret, there are 2 seizures at approximately 1:00 p.m. and then 3:00 p.m. on the 13th.  All of these occur while the patient seems to be without any clinical signs or symptoms and both are brief.  They have characteristic frequency evolution.  No motor activity is seen in association with these.
The possibility of additional seizure in the early morning hours on the 14th cannot be excluded, given the nature of the EEG data.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal long-term video EEG monitoring session due to:
Two seizures recorded on the afternoon of the 13th.
Left temporal focal slowing.
Left temporal sharp waves and some periodic sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is diagnostic of a focal mechanism for seizures.  In this fragile elderly adult, it was very difficult to obtain good quality EEG recording without sedating the patient.
