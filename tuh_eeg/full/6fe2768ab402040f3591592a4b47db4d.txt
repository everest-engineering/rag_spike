History:	55 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Last reported event occurred ~3 days
Medications:	KEPPRA, NEURONTIN, ELAVIL, FLEXERIL, VALIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently observed.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During very brief drowsiness, the
alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Alpha variant, fast
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 21-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
