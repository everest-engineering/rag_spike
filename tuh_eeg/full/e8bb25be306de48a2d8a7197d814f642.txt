CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 85-year-old woman with epilepsy.  The patient was identified by her sister 1 week ago sitting, drooling, eyes rolling up and incontinent.  Patient is amnestic for the event.
MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Keppra, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred but photic stimulation was completed.  This is a routine, 20-minute EEG. It was technically satisfactory with impedances under 5 KOhms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a scant amount of 7-8 Hz activity admixed in with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is prominent eye blink artifact.  There is intermittent, subtle slowing from the left hemisphere without disruption of faster frequency activity.  Features of drowsiness include a decrease in eye movement and muscle.
The patient appears to the technologist a little confused but answers all questions appropriately.
Photic stimulation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 100 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Mild background disorganization.
Intermittent focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison.  This EEG, in the context of this individual's age,  supports a mild disturbance of cerebral function, as well as an underlying structural or functional disturbance in the left hemisphere.
