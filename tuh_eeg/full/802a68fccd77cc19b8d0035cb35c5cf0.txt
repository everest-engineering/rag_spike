CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old female 20 weeks pregnant with diabetes, history of coma during this pregnancy with blunt trauma to the head followed by 4 seizures on March 31 with tongue biting but no loss of consciousness or incontinence.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, (Lamictal)?

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The technologist is assisted by an aid, but the patient is not cooperative.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a small amount of low voltage central beta activity near 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm. The patient does not cooperate, particularly with testing, but in the awake record there is no epileptiform activity.

HR: 110 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is one of many EEGs for this young adult during this pregnancy. Over time, the focal features and the epileptiform features have resolved. The patient's poor cooperation would prohibit additional testing and additional testing to be deferred until such time that the patient can cooperate.
