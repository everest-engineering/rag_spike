HISTORY:  A 23-year-old right-handed woman, with intermittent right-sided weakness, occurring during relaxation, past history of headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A 24-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in backup theta followed by posts, vertex waves, K complexes were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Abundant stage 2 sleep was noted with frequent transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep.
Hyperventilation elicits an increase in higher amplitude rhythmic sign.  Photic stimulation is performed, although the patient is drifting off to sleep and elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features are identified in sleep.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study when the patient is experiencing, her typical symptoms may be of value.
