PMHX: BIPOLAR DISORDER
Medications:	KLONOPIN, TRAZODONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present.
