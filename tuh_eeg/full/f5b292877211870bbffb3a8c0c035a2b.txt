MEMORY LOSS THAT'S BECOMING WORSE. PMHX SIG FOR MVA AUTO VS
PED IN 1988 WITH LOC, CHEST PAIN DM 2, HEADACHES, ASTHMA.
Medications:	CYMBALTA, ULTRAM, CELEXA, XANAX, ALTACE, BYSTOLIC, ZYRTEC, PROAIR,
PRILOSEC, METFORMIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 15-25, 8.5-9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  No sleep architecture is present.
There is occasional independent bitemporal slowing during wakefulness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Beta diffuse
Focal slowing, rhythmic, occasional, bilateral temporal, independent
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is an abnormal EEG due to  occasional independent focal slowing in the
bitemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
