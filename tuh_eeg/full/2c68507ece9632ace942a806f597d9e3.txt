History:	53 year old female status post being struck by car with cervical fracture and orbital
fracture.
Medications:	Propofol, Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, lethargic, obtunded
Description:
Waking background is attenuated and characterized by a fragmented 9Hz alpha rhythm.  A
moderate amount of symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal
regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present but there is attenuation over the left hemisphere compared with the
right.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, discontinuous, bilateral diffuse
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to diffuse amplitude attenuation as well a focal
attenuation over the left hemisphere. No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
Attenuation may result from a structural abnormality between the brain the recording electrode
(hematoma or contusion), but may also reflect a medication effect.
