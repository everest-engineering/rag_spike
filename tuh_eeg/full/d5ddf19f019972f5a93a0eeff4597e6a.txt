CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old male with new onset of seizures, 8 months ago, seizure free for the last 2-3 months.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal and central beta.  Mu was identified in the central regions.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm with slow rolling eye movements.  The beta spindles were noted, but sleep is not sustained.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort, producing an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate is 50-70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat test may be of use.
