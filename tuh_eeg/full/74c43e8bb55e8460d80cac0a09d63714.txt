CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 65-year-old male with nocturnal epilepsy and increasing convulsions, occurring in March.  In May, he had 3.  The patient  typically has only 1 every several months.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, metformin, glipizide, ciprofloxacin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
TECHNICAL:  Despite acceptable impedance, there were some electrode problems and artifacts.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  There are occasional bursts of frontal slowing which are delta or theta frequency, relatively symmetric.  Some of these seem to be notched.  With the use of an average reference, there seems to be a discrete, left frontal sharp wave which may have been accentuated by faster frequency photic stimulation.  At the close of the record, as the patient becomes drowsy, __________ symmetry is identified in the section of the record without artifact with a little bit of left frontal focal slowing.
Heart rate:  78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Discrete left frontal sharp waves.
Focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal or frontocentral regions noted despite the artifact described above.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of a focal mechanism for seizures.  There is some subtle underlying focality in the record.  Correlation with imaging is suggested.
