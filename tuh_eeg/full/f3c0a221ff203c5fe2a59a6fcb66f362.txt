CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 31-year-old woman with a history of childhood seizures that resolved approximately 12 years of age, now with new onset generalized tonic clonic convulsions for approximately 1 year.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra 250 mg in the morning and in the evening, Lamotrigine 25 mg in the evening, trazodone and Seroquel.

CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was reviewed at least once in a 24 hour period.  Seizure detector and spike detector software were activated.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.  The patient was equipped with an event button.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated 9.5 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, slow wave sleep, and several epochs of REM sleep are captured.  Occasional bursts of polymorphic theta and delta are captured over the left anterior temporal region.  These are most pronounced during drowsiness.  No typical events were captured.

FINDINGS:
1. Occasional mild left anterior temporal slowing.
2. No typical events.

IMPRESSION:  This is mildly abnormal 24 hour continuous audio video EEG monitoring due to occasional mild left anterior temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No typical events were captured.
