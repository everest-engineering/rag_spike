CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed woman with a history of head trauma 17 years ago, subsequently developing small and big seizures, now with tonic clonic seizures in sleep, small seizures were hands and right leg tremor.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage, but there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta, followed by POSTS and vertex waves.  K-complexes and spindles are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response, despite the fact that the patient is transitioning into stage II sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
HR:    80 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
