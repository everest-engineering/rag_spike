CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old right handed female with history of migraines and blackout episodes questionable for seizures.



MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Naproxen, Depakote.



REASON FOR STUDY:  Questionable seizures.



INTRODUCTION:  Digital video  EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.



TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.



DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz with an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  There is a slightly increased amount of frontocentral beta seen more diffusely.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.



ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.



SEIZURES:    None



IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
