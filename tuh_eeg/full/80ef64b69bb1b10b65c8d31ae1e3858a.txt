History:	59 YR MALE SIP CODE 11/14 UNKNOWN TIME  HYPOTHERMIA PROTOCOL.  BODY TEMP NOW 99 '. RIO ECS
Medications: Seddon:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpatient), 24 hrs
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present The normal anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies is not seen. There is no spontaneous state change during the recording and no change.with visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. There is no electrocerebral activity over 2uV during the recording. The last hour of the EEG were performed according to the guidelines of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society for the determination of electrocerebral. No normal architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 120 There was an intermittent artifact that appeared to be related to the ventilator.
Summary of Findings:
Electrocerebral inactivity
Interpretation:
This is an isoelectric EEG performed according the the ACNS guidelines for the determination of electrocerebral inactivity. This EEG is consistent but not diagnostic of, cerebral death.
