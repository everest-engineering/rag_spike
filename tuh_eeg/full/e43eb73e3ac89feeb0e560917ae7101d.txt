History:	PRIOR EEG//PT PRESENTS WITH H/O RECENT SZ X 1 WEEK AGO; LOC
W/FALL, RT ARM SHAKING FOR A FEW MIN. AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION.
Medications:	Gabapentin, Keppra, Zonisamide
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the temporal region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness (TIRDA)
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent, left
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is an ABNORMAL EEG due to bursts of TIRDA in left hemisphere. There
presence of TIRDA activity places this patient at higher risk for seizures. Clinical correlation is
recommended.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
