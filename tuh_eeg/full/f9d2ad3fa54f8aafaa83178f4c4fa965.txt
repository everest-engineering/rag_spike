CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old male, presented with SOB then passing out. This was witnessed by wife.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Versed
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and comatose.  He has rare eye movement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a low voltage flow mixed delta and theta pattern.  There are occasional sharply contoured discharges including some bilateral GPEDs and a handful that area bit more remarkable on the right or left.  There is a scant degree of variability in the EEG, although there is a fair amount of muscle. In wakefulness background.  Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR:    80 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Frontally predominant generalized periodic complexes.
A handful of sharply contoured bursts which may be in the right or left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Given the clinical history, this is a much more vigorous EEG pattern than expected.  No seizures were recorded.
