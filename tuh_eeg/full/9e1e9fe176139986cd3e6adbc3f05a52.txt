REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old man with refractory epilepsy, left frontal heterotopia, kidney stones, breakthrough seizures due to noncompliance with medications.  Last seizure during sleep per wife.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Frequent sharp waves seen at F7/T3, at times at T3 and at times at T5 while in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen over the left hemisphere intermittently at T3 and sometimes at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
Heart rate:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent left anterior temporal, mid temporal and posterior temporal focal sharp waves as well as focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the same region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
