51 y.o. female who was referred for routine EEG for LOC. History of epilepsy and HIV. Found down. Prominent left frontal scalp, nondepressed fracture with extension to the orbital roof and associated extraconal hematoma and acute fracture of the left frontal bone .
Medications: Keppra, Ativan , Fentanyl, Versed Technique:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record performed at bedside and included a single channel of EKG. The patient was in a hard collar and moving about at the end of the study.
EEG Background:
The	background was characteristic beta. Beta is asymmetric, more prominent on the right. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle artifact and more theta activity.
Characterized by replacement of normal background with a mixed frequency slow pattern . Initially, there is lower voltage delta with bursts of Paroxysmal Activity (non-epileptiform) :
None
Epileptiform Activity:
No epileptiform activity was present. Activation Procedures:
Tactile stimulation elicited an increase in theta activity Clinical Events :
There were no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
Heart Rate:
A heart rate of 150 bpm was captured on a single EKG lead.
Impression:Abnormal bedside portable EEG due to: Marked background slowing.
An asymmetry with more prominent fast activity on the left.
Clinical Correlation:
This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. The asymmetry described above is ipsilateral to the skull fracture and large scalp hematoma. The presence of reactivity is a good prognostic indicator.	The scalp hematoma may attenuate EEG activity on the left.	No seizures were recorded.
