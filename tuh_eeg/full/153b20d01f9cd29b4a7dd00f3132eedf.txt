Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 01/08/2014 to 01/09/2014.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical representation of the EEG
was available at the bedside and over the hospital network for continuous review by EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
The waking background has improved and is mainly characterized by a 25-40 uV, 10 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm, which attenuate symmetrically with eye opening.  During drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Almost continuous F8/T4 focal slowing is present.  Frequent sharp waves are present in the F8/T4
region.  No seizures were noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent right anterior temporal sharp waves which are
indicative of a highly potentially epileptogenic acute focal destructive lesion in that region. Lastly
there has been improvement in the background slowing.  These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
