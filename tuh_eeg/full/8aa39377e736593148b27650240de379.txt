CLINICAL HISTORY:   55 year old right handed male with head trauma in the 1970s, seizures began in the 1980s when the patient was treated with Haldol.  Seizures described as shaking with loss of consciousness.  Hepatitis C.
MEDICATIONS:   Lisinopril, Cogentin, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with an alpha rhythm of 8.3 Hz.  The activity is slightly higher in the left hemisphere than the right. As the patient drifts off to sleep, the alpha rhythm drops out faster on the right than the left and at that point there is a bit of a breech in the right frontal central region. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta with a subtle asymmetry with a little theta in the left frontal central region. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The drop out of faster frequency activity on the right as the patient transitions sometimes into drowsiness suggests a right hemisphere process.  On other occasions there is a bit of focal slowing in the left frontal central region.  No
epileptiform features were identified.  These findings may be correlated with imaging and make carry some correlation with a history of bihemispheric head trauma.
