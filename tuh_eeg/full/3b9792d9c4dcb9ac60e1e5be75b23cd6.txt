CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed woman with onset of generalized tonic
clonic seizures. The last seizure was in August last year, 2010.

MEDICATIONS: None.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.Â· Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. The EEG contains features of wakefulness and drowsiness.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is well organized background
of alpha rhythm with a 8.5 hertz. In addition, there are some right temporal slowing,
more specifically at T4. This study has significant amount of artifact. However, during
hyperventilation, the patient has right temporal slowing at T4. Photic stimulation
generates photic driving from 7 to 21 hertz.

HR: 68 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These features are suggestive of a right temporal
abnormality. This EEG is very similar to prior study.
