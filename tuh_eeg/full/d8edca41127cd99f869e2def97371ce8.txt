CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old male with epilepsy and last seizures November 2010, the
previous year. History of epilepsy and cerebellar atrophy as well as cerebral palsy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Depakote, Omeprazole
Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This Is an awake record for a patient who was able
to cooperate. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes continuous
eye blink. There is 13 Hz activity noted in the occipital regions but it is not possible to assess for
an alpha rhythm, although it does look as if there is a 13 Hz alpha rhythm. There is generous
diffuse faster frequency beta activity and continuous eye blink. Hyperventilation produces an
increase in background slowing. photic stimulation does appear to elicit a driving response
more so on the left than on the right. There is a suggestion of rhythmic right frontal theta
confounded by the patient's continuous eye blinking.
84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
2. Paucity of some of the normal wave forms anticipated for an adult.
3. Question rhythmic right frontotemporal theta.
CLINICAL This is one of many EEGs for this individual dating to 2003. The
features described above are similar to previous studies. Only the 2006 study, Identified right
anterior temporal sharp waves. Of note, this patient has 3 other medical record numbers
