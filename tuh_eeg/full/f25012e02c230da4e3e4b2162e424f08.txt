CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old left handed male with a past history of epilepsy,
thought to be seizure-free since 2005 but now with episodes of incontinence.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Carbatrol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.


DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is very low voltage and includes primarily a lower voltage 5 Hz to 6 Hz beta frequency pattern with
scant amounts of delta in drowsiness and scant amounts of alpha frequency activity.
Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response which can be identified using the
software.


HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Low voltage theta pattern.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a previous study from 2006,
with a low voltage pattern with prominent eye blink. The ability to identify the theta in the background may be due to the use of newer technologies. No epileptiform features
were seen in the last 2EEGs. Consideration for a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function is appropriate.
