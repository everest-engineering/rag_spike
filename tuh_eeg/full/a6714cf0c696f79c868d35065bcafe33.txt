History:	66 YO FEMALE  WITNESSED BY CARE GIVER WITH DANGLING HANDS ARMS AND HEAD, UNRESPONSIVE WITH TWISTED MOUTH AND EYES OPEN X2 PREVIOUS DAY. PT CLAIMS NEVER TO HAVE LOC JUST COULD NOT RESPOND.PMHX: HTN, GLAUCOMA, DM2, OSA?, CVA 2013. PT CLAIMS NO HEAD TRAUMA
Medications:	HEPARIN, INSULIN, NIFEDIPINE, PRAVASTATIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV alpha rhythm at best reaching 8.5Hz, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz activity.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear. Intermittent polymorphic delta activity at times sharply contoured is present in the left anterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
HR is 78.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, left temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, continuous, mild
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. There is also  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild-moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
