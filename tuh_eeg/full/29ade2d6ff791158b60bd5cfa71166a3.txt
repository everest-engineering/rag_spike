CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old male with severe traumatic head injury.
MEDICATIONS: Propofol, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using
standard 10-20 system or electrode placement with 1 channel or EKG. The patient is
intubated and comatose. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous
mixed frequency slow pattern. Occasional sharp waves are observed most of which are
at C3 but with some variability in terms of spread to the left frontocentral or
centrotemporal region. Shifting asymmetries are noted and in this section of the record
the activity is actually slower on the right at times than the left. Intermittent discontinuity
is observed and there are brief bursts or sharp waves at C3.
HR: 70bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowly.
2. Left central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were noted in the previous first 24 hours of
the record. No seizures were recorded. Correlation with clinical history is suggested.
