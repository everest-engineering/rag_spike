History:	72 YR FEMALE FOUND STARING WITH  NOT RESPONDING. PMHX: COPD,
SCLC. CT. GEN ATROPHY.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Intermittent bursts of diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology
at 1 hz are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior
phase lag and vary with stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 108
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
