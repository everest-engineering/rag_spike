History:	74 YR MALE WITH CC OF HEADACHE FOUND TO HAVE LARGE LEFT
POSTERIOR PARIETAL/TEMPORAL LOBAR HEMATOMA WITH EXTENSIVE
VASOGENIC EDEMA/ WITH 7MM SHIFT  PT WITH INCREASE IN SLEEPINESS.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PROTONIX, ATORVASTATIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present in the left frontal region,
with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F3.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, left frontal
Triphasic waves, continuous, moderate
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of continuous focal slowing and occasional sharp waves in the
left frontal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability, which is
consistent with the known hemorrhage and it is indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region. In addition there is  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
