CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old woman with Down syndrome, anxiety, crying spells, and 2 recent events which may have been seizures versus startle events.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is the patient's 5th EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG includes a dynamic pattern. At some point there is more of a 6.5 to 6.8 Hz theta frequency pattern. There is an underlying 8 to 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm observed in the background. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. In the transition to sleep, there is an increase in background slowing with a small amount of shifting slowing.
HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent rhythmic theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. This is the 5th EEG for this individual. Only a single EEG has ever identified epileptiform activity and that EEG identifies only a solitary right central sharp wave.
