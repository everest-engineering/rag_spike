CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old right-handed woman with ruptured subarachnoid hemorrhage after crack cocaine ingestion.  Status post ventriculostomy and coil.  History of drug abuse and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, morphine, Keppra, gentamicin, and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Impedances were generally under 5 kilo ohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.  The patient was awake and arousable, but sometimes confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates continuous pattern with rhythmic theta noted from the left.  Arrhythmic delta activity was noted from the right hemisphere, particularly right posterior quadrant.  The patient is described as having a ventriculostomy at the midline, but amplitudes are somewhat increased on the right relative to the left.  This is a dynamic record and when the patient is awake, a well-defined alpha rhythm, which is reactive to eye opening is identified.  It ranges from 7.8 to 8.3 Hz and is sometimes disrupted on the right compared to the left.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere noted intermittently with a mixture of rhythmic mixed theta delta and arrhythmic delta activity particularly right posterior quadrant, but generous field of spread.
Modest background slowing from both hemispheres with slowing of the alpha rhythm when present, bilaterally.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the right. It may be correlated with imaging and exam.  No epileptiform features were identified.  There were sections of the record when the patient was able to follow commands well.  If this individual is thought to have seizures, additional studies may be considered.
