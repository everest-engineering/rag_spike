CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed male with tonic clonic seizure,
abnormal MRI, hippocampal pathology and Eaton-Lambert's syndrome.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, HCTZ.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The waking background is somewhat disorganized
with an 8.5 Hz posterior dominate rhythm and an excess amount of background theta.
There is shifting temporal slowing, more so on the left. In hyperventilation there is left
temporal sharply contour slowing. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: N/A
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity, primarily in the left hemisphere and in fact, primarily in the
left temporal region.
3. Subtle, underlying sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the previous studies,
February 23, 2009, December 16, 2008. The epileptiform activity is less prominent in
this study .
