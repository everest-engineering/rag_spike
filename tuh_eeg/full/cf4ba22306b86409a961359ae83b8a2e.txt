History:	60 year old man undergoing thromboendarterectomy.

INCISION: 11:09A
HEPARIN: 33000 UNITS 11:23A
COOLING :11:41A  with complete burst-suppression 12:53P
WARM:  2:12P        BASELINE: symmetrical

CARDIAC ARREST 11:56A
CIRCULATORY ARREST 1:04P
Medications:	Fentanyl, Versed, Vecuronium, isoflurane, heparin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, comatose
Description:
Patient is awake early in the recording.  The background consists of low amplitude 10 Hz PDR with
normal AP gradient.  Patient is intubated and by ~10:15 am the background consists of a mixture of
frequencies without the PDR or AP gradient present.  Incision takes place at ~ 11:09 AM.  Cooling
starts at ~ 11:41 AM.  As cooling progresses, there is progressive slowing of the background with
complete burst-suppression achieved at ~12:53 PM.  Circulatory arrest starts at ~1:09 PM and ends
at ~ 1:23 PM.  Rewarming starts at ~ 2:12 PM with bursts of cerebral activity noted at ~2:32 PM.
Return of QRS complexes is noted at 2:24 PM.  By the end of the case, patient is normothermic
Summary of Findings:
Other, unremarkable study
Interpretation:
This was an unremarkable ~5.5 hours remote intraoperative continuous EEG monitoring.  Out of
those hours, ~ 3.5 hours was spent monitoring patient live, out of the OR, remotely.
