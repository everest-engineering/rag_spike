History:	64 year old woman with a history of a renal transplant and seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, vancomycin, meropenem, fentanyl
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower
waveforms and attenuation over the left.  The background over the right consists of a mixture of
polymorphic theta and delta activity with attenuation of the background posteriorly.  The
background over the left consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta anteriorly with
attenuation of the background in the middle and posterior quadrants.  Frequent periods of diffuse
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  With stimulation, there is subtle
increase in the degree of theta activity and decrease in the background discontinuity.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Attenuation, right posterior and left middle and posterior quadrants
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 22 minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing, voltage
attenuation over the right posterior quadrant and left middle and posterior quadrants as well as
focal left hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing and attenuation is
indicative of a focal structural lesion over the left.  Voltage attenuation could indicate a fluid
collection between a skull and the brain (such as SDH).  When compared to the EEG from
2/11/2015, there is new focal left hemispheric slowing - please correlate clinically.
