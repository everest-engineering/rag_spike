LENGTH OF ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM:  Nearly 24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 35-year-old man with history of HIV and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Include Neurontin, Lamictal, HIV medications and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Occasional MU rhythm is captured.
During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation produces mild symmetrical diffuse background slowing.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple/frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep nearly 24-minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
