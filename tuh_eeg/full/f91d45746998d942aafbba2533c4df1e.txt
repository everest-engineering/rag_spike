CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old male with end-stage renal disease on dialysis and hypertension, with the last seizure in December 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zocor.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Independent F7/T3 and much more than F8/T4 slow waves seen intermittently at 2-4 Hz in an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:    None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
