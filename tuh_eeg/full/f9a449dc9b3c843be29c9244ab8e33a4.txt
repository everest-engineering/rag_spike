REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, anxiety and a pacemaker, who presents with 30% burns over his body due to a house fire.  He was noted to have worsening of right facial droop.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, vecuronium, vancomycin, morphine, Zosyn, dopamine, Levophed, Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely suppressed background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There was no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Generalized attenuation seen diffusely through the EEG with no clear electrocerebral activity seen.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized attenuation and lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific or regressed etiology.  Although no clear electrocerebral activity could be seen, no final conclusions can be made about this as
the patient was not recorded in a brain death protocol.  This could be due in a large part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
