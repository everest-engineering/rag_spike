History:	64 yo male p/w bilateral shaking of the arms and confusion. postictal agitation.
pmhx: HTN, DM, HLD, MI, Cocaine abuse, neuropathy, epilepsy, infarction L
occipital, prostate cancer.
Medications:	Trileptal, Depakote, Amantadine, Lasix, Metformin, Plavix, Coreg, Lisinopril
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present but state changes could be seen.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at F7.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Sharp waves, frequent, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the left anterior
temporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region,
and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization-
related epilepsy. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
