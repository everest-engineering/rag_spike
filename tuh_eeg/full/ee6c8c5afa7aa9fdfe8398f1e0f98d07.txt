Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, -Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present at T3 during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  At times it was sharply contoured.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 HR awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent focal slowing in
the left mid-temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
