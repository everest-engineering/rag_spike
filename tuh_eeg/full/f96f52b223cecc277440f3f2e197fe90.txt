History:	50 YEAR OLD MALE RIGHT HANDED. WITH AN EPISODE OF DIZZINESS AND
NAUSEA AND LOST OF CONSCIOUSNESS,NO INCONTINENCE OR TONGUE
BITING. HISTORY OF DB TYPE 2 RODS IN LOWER PART OF BACK. PT TAKES
A LOT OF PAIN MEDICATION.
Medications:	COMPAZINE,MECLIZINE,PERCOCET,ZOCOR,PRILOSEC,TYLENOL,LIORESAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, continuous, mild, bilateral diffuse
Other, Mild slowing of PDR
Interpretation:
This is a mildly abnormal EEG, awake and drowsy due to diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction and may be secondary to medication side effects.
