History:	28 YO MAN HX GTC SZ SINCE CHILDHOOD, MOST RECENT LAST MONTH:
EYES ROLL BACK, HEAD BACK, BREATHES HEAVY, SHAKES, LOC LASTING 1-
2 MIN; SLEEP AFTERWARDS; DX: AUTISM, CARD ARRHYTHMIA, AFIB?11-9-15 PT
HAS NOT HAD SZ. SINCE FEB PER GRANDMOTHER
Medications:	DIVALPROATE, DILTIAZEM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also
seen.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the frontal region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
