KEPPRA,  FLEXERIL

Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1-2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.

No focal slowing is present.  Occasional brief bursts (2-3 seconds) of generalized frontally-maximal  spike? and-wave discharges occur with a regular repetition rate of 4-4.5 Hz.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps} does not produce any effect. HR was 66

Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast, intermittent

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of bifrontal synchronous spike-and-wave,  which are potentially epileptogenic and consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. In addition there is mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.
