HISTORY: 32 year old left handed male with Klinefelter syndrome, childhood epilepsy, right temple lobectomy, incompletely controlled seizures, and seizures within the last 2 months.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is the fourth EEG for this individual. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background is somewhat slow with a mixture of alpha and theta frequency activity. There is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm but there is some 6 Hz, 4.5 Hz activity and some very subtle delta. There is intermittent rhythmic or sharply contoured slowing in the right temporal region and some simple right temporal sharp waves. Skull defect and head rocking artifact are noted on the right. Vertex waves are observed In stage I sleep. During photic stimulation, occasional right anterior temporal high amplitude or median amplitude well defined spike and wave discharges are noted. There is also a single sharp wave noted at F4. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the focal slowing.
HR 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right anterior temporal focal slowing.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Modest background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
There has been some slowing of the background over time for this Individual. The focal slowing and epileptiform activity may be correlated with imaging, particularly if the temporal lobectomy was a right temporal lobectomy.
