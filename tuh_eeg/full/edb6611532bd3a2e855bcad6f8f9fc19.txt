History:	85 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P CODE APPROX 45 MIN. NOW ON HYPERTHERMIA  PROTOCOL
Medications:	EPINEPHRINE, FENTANYL Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by almost complete attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies . No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present. Intermittent short bursts of generalized frontally-maximal spikes are present followed by muscle artifact. During this the patient exhibits mouth movements
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli. HR was 66. Technical difficulties: There was a continuous ventilator and diffuse
myogenic artifact during the entire record.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, severe
Spikes, intermittent generalized, frontal predominant
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse attenuation of background activity, absent alpha rhythm with intermittent frontal predominant spikes. These findings are consistent (in the absence of sedatives) with severe diffuse cortical damage and irritability, respectively. The mouth movement seen are clinically consistent with myoclonus. Altogether this findings are suggestive of a poor prognosis for functional neurological recovery. These findings were conveyed	e primary team.
