Medications:	KEPPRA, MOTRIN, DECADRON, FOLVITE,  BACTRIM, COLACE, ATRIPLA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the left frontal region at F7/F3 during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is an asymmetry in the amplitude seen higher on the left
consistent with a breach.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
frontal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region, which is consistent
with the known lesion and surgery.
