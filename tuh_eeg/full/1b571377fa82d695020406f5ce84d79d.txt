DATES OF RECORDING:  01/15/2013 through 01/16/2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Epilepsy
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient wore her CPAP mask at night.  The awake EEG was remarkable for a great deal of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness the background EEG was well organized.  Occasionally in wakefulness and as the patient is sitting up and transitioning to sleep, there are bursts of shifting and slowing a little bit more prominent in the left temporal region but, unfortunately, this section of the record is always compromised by artifact.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
No sharp waves or spikes were noted in sleep.
