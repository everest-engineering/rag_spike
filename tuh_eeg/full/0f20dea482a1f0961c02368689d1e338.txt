History:	19 YO MALE PMHX GSW S/P EX - LAP 2 WKS AGO. PT FEELING WEAK,
WALKING WITH CAIN. PT FELL DOWN STAIRS, WAS ASYSTOLE IN FIELD, PEA
TRANSIENT, VFIB, SHOCKED IN FIELD, BAGGED, EPI DRIP TITRATED OFF, 20
Medications:	FENTANYL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
attenuation with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal
sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.  On the video the patient appears to be twitching intermittently a movement
artifact can be seen on the EEG but no cortical electrographic correlate is seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR is 102
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background attenuation and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The
twitching had no EEG correlate and likely represents a subcortical myoclonus. The findings in this
EEG suggest a poor prognosis.
