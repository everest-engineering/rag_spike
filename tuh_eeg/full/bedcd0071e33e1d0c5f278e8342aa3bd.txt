History:	31 YR OLD FEMALE WITH PRIOR EEG, UNCONTROLLED SZ, PRESENTS FOR
FOLLOW UP EEG, DENIES ANY RECENT SZ SINCE DC'D.
Medications:	KEPPRA, DILANTIN, ZONISAMIDE, PROTONIX, ZOFRAN, PREDNISONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
POSTS and symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces a strong symmetric harmonic and supraharmonic photic driving response.  HR is 96.  There
is F3 electrode artifact throughout much of the recording, limiting evaluation of focal features in
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Compared to prior EEGs, this record is
markedly improved with absence of left centroparietal epileptiform features. No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.  Nonetheless, the lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine
EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG.
