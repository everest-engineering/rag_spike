CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 67-year-old woman status post left temporal lobectomy in 1971 for refractory epilepsy with significant improvement.  The patient has been seizure free for 1 year. Seizures occur without warning and appear to be tonic-clonic in nature.  The patient previously evaluated during this hospitalization for delirium.
MEDICATIONS:  Ancef, gabapentin, phenobarbital, Tegretol, vitamin D, phenytoin, levetiracetam, others.
INTRODUCTION: Twenty-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG. The patient is noted to have a left cranial scar. Impedances are below 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm of 6 to 7 hertz, at best 7.3 Hz.  Intermittent bursts of rhythmic frontal delta were noted. In addition, there is an intermittent asymmetry noted with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity noted in the left mid to posterior temporal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in the rhythmic frontal delta.
Heart rate: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
FIRDA.
Intermittent left temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified.  The rhythmic frontal delta and the bilateral slowing may be part of a metabolic encephalopathy. A follow up study as the patient recovers from her surgery is suggested.
