History:	54 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O DM, ESRD W/ LE TINGLING AND
WEAKNESS, FOUND TO HAVE C3-CS CERVICAL CORD COMPRESSION, S/P
LAMINECTOMY. POST COURSE- HYPOTENSIVE, ? SZ AND
Medications:	KEPPRA, AZACTAM, PHENYLEPHRINE, NOREPINEPHRINE, VASOPRESSIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  At times there is diffuse attenuation of the background for 5-10 seconds.  Diffuse,
frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.
These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  Some state changes.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 90
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
