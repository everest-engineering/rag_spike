CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old male with 4 year history of epilepsy, with clusters of seizures now increasing.  Typically has nocturnal clusters with body tensing and generalized shaking, lasting 20-25 minutes.  Postictal confusion with aggression.  Heterotopic brain tissue.
INTRODUCTION:  A 40-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized for an adult of this age.  The alpha rhythm is typically 9.7 Hz, and more consistently slow on the right compared to the left, but demonstrates significant variability and there is a small amount of background disorganization.  In some portions of the record, the alpha rhythm is 7.5 on the left 9.7 on the right.  Hyperventilation produces rhythmic slowing, more so on the left than the right.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved, but as the patient transitions towards sleep, rare subtle sharp waves were noted towards the end in hyperventilation and in drowsiness.
Heart rate 60-84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing noted from the left hemisphere characterized by intermittent slowing of the alpha rhythm on the left relevant to the right and a focal hyperventilation response.
Subtle background disorganization for an adult of this age.
There were 2 sharp waves from the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance, but impacting the left hemisphere more significantly than the right.
