History:	51 YO MALE, DX. PEA ARREST, SEIZURE DISORDER, HYPOTHERMIA, NOW
REWARMING,  CURRENTLY ON DIALYSIS. RENAL FAILURE
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Asleep only
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with intermittent suppression of the EEG.  There was diffuse muscle
and ICU artifact.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, intermittent
Discontinuous background
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing with intermittent attenuation .
These findings are indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction consistent with the history of
anoxic brain injury.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
