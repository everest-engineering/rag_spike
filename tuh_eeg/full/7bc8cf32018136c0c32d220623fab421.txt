CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old male with bilateral carotid stenosis, 90% left carotid disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Vecuronium, fentanyl, and propofol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 3.5 hour digital EEG was recorded in the operating room using standard CEA montage with 1 channel of EKG.  One-on-one physician observation of the EEG was completed for 1 hour with remote physician back up for the remainder.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the patient was awake, slightly drowsy with 9 hertz posterior dominant rhythm.  Induction of anesthesia at 11:17 produced an intermittently discontinuous pattern.
As medications were adjusted, the EEG pattern became more continuous.  Mild shifting asymmetries were noted in the baseline prior to the placement of the clamp.  In addition, when the EEG was discontinuous, it tended to be slightly more discontinuous on the right compared to the left.  Intermittent head rocking artifact was noted.
Anesthetic medications were adjusted to ensure more continuous EEG pattern.  The patient demonstrated blood pressure fluctuations, at times as slow was 90/40 and the EEG tended to be a little bit more discontinuous or attenuated when the blood pressure fell.
The left common and internal carotid artery were clamped at 12:24.  No significant focal features were noted.  As the operative study continued, over time, the EEG was increasingly continuous, particularly after 1 o'clock.
Patency was confirmed by Doppler at 1:40:29.  Recording concluded at 230.
Heart rate: 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG monitoring during this left carotid endarterectomy was remarkable for a bit more discontinuity with a lower blood pressure, but no significant focal features with clamp.
