History:	62 year old woman who has a history of seizures.  Patient was admitted with a
stroke.  On 10/27/2015 she was observed to have an episode concerning for a
Medications:	Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening. Fast alpha variant is seen.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is
present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
There is continuous paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  It is especially
pronounced over the left temporal region (continuous polymorphic theta-delta activity).  No clear
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only portable 22-minute EEG due to continuous moderate focal
slowing in the left temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
