CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman with right internal carotid artery stenosis with bilateral MCA infarcts.
MEDICATIONS:  Include fentanyl, propofol, desflurane, vecuronium, nitroglycerin.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed in the operating room using standard CEA montage.  This was 2 hours, 12 minutes EEG recording with approximately 1 hour intraoperative physician attendance.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Before tracing began, the patient received sedative medications.  The recording was rich in beta with smaller amount of theta.  There was asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres with intermittent slowing in the left hemisphere relevant to the right.  As the level fluctuates, there is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity noted in the posterior regions bilaterally, but at times, it is bit more prominent on the left in comparison to the right.  Additionally, as the levels of anesthesia fluctuate, the degree of the background slowing increases or decreases.  The waxing and waning pattern with variability of the degree of focal slowing was reported to the surgical team prior to the placement of the clamps.  The first clamp was placed at 11:33 a.m. with an external and then internal carotid clamp.  This produced no changes in either of the hemispheres.  These findings were reported to the surgeon.  A change in the anesthesia produced an increasing degree of background slowing, voltage attenuation and increasing in degree of beta.  This was reported to Anesthesia and subsequently anesthetic agents were adjusted.  The artery was unclamped at 12:27 p.m. and the study was completed at 12:41:55 p.m.
IMPRESSION:  Clinical correlation, EEG monitoring during the right carotid endarterectomy did not produced any EEG changes with the placement of clamp.
