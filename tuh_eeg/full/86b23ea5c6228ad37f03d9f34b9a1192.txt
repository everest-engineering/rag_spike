CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old woman with renal failure, epilepsy, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, multiple amputations, admitted with head deviation to one side and impaired responsiveness.

MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Nifedipine, Depakote.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized.
There is at times an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, but at other times there is intermittent background slowing, slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm and posteriorly predominant 4-5 Hz activity. Occasional FIRDA is noted. The patient is awake and cooperative throughout the study. There is relaxed, wakefulness. There is a bit more arrhythmic delta in the right posterior region compared to the left and an occasional T6 sharp wave is observed.

HR: 78 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity, more remarkable in the posterior regions on the right.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. This may be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. There are focal features in the posterior temporal region suggesting a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
