History:	53 YR MALE WITH A HX OF POST-TRAUMATIC EPILEPSY. ADMITTED FOR
RECENT SEIZURE ACTIVITY.
SZ RIGHT EYE GAZE, RIGHT ARM EXTENSION.
Medications:	Dilantin, Phenobarb
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess beta 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the mid-temporal
region. There is also associated loss of faster frequencies in this region.  Intermittent polymorphic
delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 108
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right hemispheric, maximal mid-temporal, with
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Excessive fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right hemisphere maximal in the mid-temporal region with associated loss of faster frequencies.
This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region involving gray matter. In addition
there is  intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
