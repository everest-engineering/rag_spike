CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old female with mental retardation, cerebral palsy. The patient
developed epilepsy November 2009 with 5 episodes of unresponsiveness lasting 30 minutes.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol inhaler, Zantac, Ibuprofen
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 1 0·20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is quite low in.voltage. There is
some 6·8 Hz activity in the occipital regions, but it is not clear that this reacts to eye opening and eye closure. The overall background is accompanied by some lower voltage theta and delta with the lower voltage theta In the frontal regions. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. The adult remains awake throughout. Attempts to increase the sensitivity to look at the background cerebral activity is compromised by the very high amplitude. Some eye movement in this microcephalic adult. In the very last few seconds of the EEG, there is a burst of sharply contoured theta in the frontal regions.
HR: 114 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Paucity of normal waveforms for adult.
2. low voltage record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The burst of sharply contoured theta in the frontal regions seen In
the last second of the EEG may represent an epileptiform pattern for this individual. A small amount of theta was seen in the frontal regions and other sections of the record. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged sleep study would be necessary. Similar bursts of frontal theta were seen independently in the right or left frontal regions in other portions of the record, but without this paroxysmal and sharply contoured nature.
