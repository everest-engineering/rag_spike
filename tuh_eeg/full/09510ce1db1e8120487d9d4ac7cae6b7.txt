INTRODUCTION:
A routine EEG was performed using the 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG electrodes. Sleep was recorded with
stage 1 and no activation procedures were performed.
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin and Ativan.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:
C4 electrode artifact intermittently.
HISTORY:
A 33-year-old female with generalized tonic-clonic seizure in sleep followed by another generalized tonic-clonic seizure, given
Ativan.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to mixed theta/delta polymorphic background (frequency of 5 to 7 HZ and amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts ).
Posterior dominant rhythm is seen at best in with a frequency of 7Hz and 20-70 microvolts with some beta. Sleep stage 1 is
noted. No hyperventilation for the procedures were done. At one point during the recording, the patient is aroused, with
stimulation. She is able to speak and answer questions, the background changes slightly but remains in the theta and delta
frequency.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz and 20 to 70 microvolts in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG in awake and sleep due to generalized diffuse slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG reveals mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, Which is nonspecific with regard to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform
discharges were seen.
