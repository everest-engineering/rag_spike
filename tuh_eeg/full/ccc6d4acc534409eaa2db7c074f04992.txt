CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old male with an episode of left-sided weakness, followed by an episode of shaking.  Diabetes, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, metoprolol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory routine EEG with photic stimulation.  Hyperventilation was deferred.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep.  As the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep with K complexes, snore arousals were noted.  Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep, but brief driving was noted.
Heart rate 48 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep with snore arousals and bradycardia.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
