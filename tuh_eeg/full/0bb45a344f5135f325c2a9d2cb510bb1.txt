CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old female with past history of stroke, heart failure. Episode of confusion and agitation, right MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS: Acetaminophen, ASA, Celexa, Chlorthalidone, Claritin, Isoniazid, Norvasc, Oxycodone, Pyridoxine, Senna, Tegretol, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG
demonstrates an asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres. The left hemisphere is somewhat slow with an alpha rhythm of 8.3 hertz and a small amount of excess theta to the right hemisphere demonstrates significant disruption of faster frequency activity with scant alpha frequency activity. It is more of a lower voltage featureless delta and theta pattern. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response which is identified bilaterally.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere characterized by slower activity and disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Mild slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been noted on 2 previous EEGs. Of note there was a remote history of sharp waves noted on the left which were not seen for this patient today.
