HISTORY: A 44-year old male with 11 year history of epilepsy. Tonic-clonic seizures last minutes. Recent breakthrough seizure. (CP5)
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Inderal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and slow rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 60-90 bpm, increasing in hyperventilation.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. A low voltage record is not necessarily a pathological finding. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be considered.
