EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 78  Some technical issues with F7 and F8 electrodes
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
