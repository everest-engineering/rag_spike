CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 23-year-old woman with refractory tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal.
DATE OF STUDY:  March 5th through March 6th.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had a seizure the night before on the evening of the 4th.  She reported feeling quite drowsy on the morning of the 5th.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As this section of the record opens, there is a bit of background slowing.  The patient also is very sleepy transitioning in and out of stage II sleep with spindles, vertex waves, and posts.  Artifact at the C4 electrode was noted.  There is also a suggestion intermittently that she is about to transition into slow-wave sleep with higher amplitude 2 Hz delta.
By the early evening of the 5th, the patient is much more awake, watching TV with a normal background and lambda waves.  Over the course of the sleep recording March 5-March 6, abundant stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles were noted.  In addition, rare dyshormia was seen.  Slow wave sleep was also noted, although REM sleep was not identified.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
