CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old woman with a history of previous DVT, admitted with pulmonary embolus status post multiple cardiac arrests on 4/19/2010, and then more than 12 hours prior to this EEG on 4/20/2010. Inpatient EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Protonix, Bicarb.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 40 minute EEG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a technically, extremely challenging EEG for a patient on multiple drips, a ventilator and an I and 0 device. The background EEG is markedly suppressed but the heart rate is 130 to 140 beats per minute. Despite multiple attempts, although there are artifacts In the record, not all artifacts can be eliminated.
HR: 140 bpm
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:: Markedly suppressed EEG. There are, however, technical difficulties and this cannot be considered an ECS record. The possibility of scant cerebral activity must be considered given the pattern described above. In any case, however, the activity is very low voltage, not reactive to stimuli and quite attenuated.
