CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed male with multiple surgeries for cranioplasty, status post head trauma, episode of left facial twitching and left arm twitching.  Evaluate for postoperative lethargy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG in wakefulness includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Although both hemispheres are slow, the activity is a little bit lower voltage and more suppressed on the left compared to the right.  A prominent breach rhythm is noted.
HR:    72-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
An asymmetry with more lower voltage, more featureless pattern on the left.
Background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   This EEG supports a bihemispheric process.  The presence of reactivity also is a positive.
