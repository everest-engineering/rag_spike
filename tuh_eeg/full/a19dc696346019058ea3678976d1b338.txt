CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old male, found on the floor, seizing with multiple, recurrent seizures, transferred to the hospital after 4 tonic-clonic seizures with tongue biting.  Past history of alcohol dependence, asthma, hepatitis B.  Evaluate for status epilepticus.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, Tylenol, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was confused.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is poorly organized with shifting slowing.  Superimposed upon this, there is a left occipital sharp wave.  In the sections of the record where the left posterotemporal or occipital sharp wave is identified, there is disruption of faster frequency activity and prominent arrhythmic delta.  There is also some variability, some sharp waves maximum at O1, others T5 or P3 and a handful that are more left frontotemporal.  Vertex sharp waves are noted, shifting through right and left vertex region in wakefulness were noted as well.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase arrhythmic slowing, particularly in the occipital regions.  Stimulation of the patient produces artifact and an increase in faster flash frequencies.

HR:    72 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharp waves and spikes in the left posterior quadrant primarily O1, but sometimes T5.
2. Arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere, particularly in the occipital region.
3. Shifting slowing.
4. Vertex sharp waves identified in wakefulness, shifting from right or left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  The focal epileptiform activity and the prominent arrhythmic delta activity may be correlated with imaging.
