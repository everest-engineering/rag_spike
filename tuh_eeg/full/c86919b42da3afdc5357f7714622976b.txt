History:	68 year old man with a history of seizures and stroke.  Last seizure in 7/2014.
Medications:	Keppra and Neurontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7.5-8 Hz theta activity which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
No clear focal slowing is present.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Nearly continuous EMG artifact is present in bilateral anterior leads.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, EMG, nearly continuous, bilateral anterior
No stage 2 sleep
Posterior dominant rhythm, slow variant
Interpretation:
This is probably normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  Suspect that slow posterior dominant
rhythm is a variant (rather than an abnormality) since it is clearly reactive. No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  There is nearly continuous EMG artifact in
bilateral anterior leads.  So subtle anterior focal slowing and epileptiform discharges could have
