History:		52 YO MALE W/ INFECTED FOOT ULCER, HYPOTHERMIA  PROTOCOL, WAS JERKING CONTINUOUSLY  UNTIL GIVEN 10 MGS OF VEC,
Medications:		MIDAZOLAM, VECURONIUM, ATIVAN, DEPACON, CHLORHEXIDINE, ZOSYN, VANCOMYCIN, ASA, KLONOPIN,


Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:



Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes




Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse attenuation.  No normal sleep architecture was present.

No focal slowing is present. Generalized frontally-maximal polyspike-and-slow-wave discharges (GPEDs) occur with a regular repetition rate of 1 Hz. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 120

Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, severe diffuse
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous diffuse

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. In addition to GPEDs.  These findings are suggestive of marked diffuse cortical dysfunction and irritability, which in the setting of hypoxic injury portends a poor prognosis.
