History:	unknown male found down at the bottom on 8 steps severely intoxicated. Found to
have SAH/SDH, s/p craniectomy / evacuation of hematoma followed by drain
placement. 3/22- episode of generalized shaking for 15-20 mins.
Medications:	Keppra, Fentanyl, Desmopressin, Famotidine, Metoprolol, Ativan, Magnesium
Sulfate, Hydralazine, Dilaudid, Gentamicin, Tylenol, Lovenox, Vancomycin,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal midtemporal.
There is an asymmetry of beta activity, with increased amplitude on the left.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 90  Some electrode movement artifact seen over the left
Summary of Findings:
Breach artifact, continuous, left central
Attenuation, continuous central
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere and
breach.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and consistent with the
known subdural and craniotomy. In addition there is .  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Patient will go on to LTM.
