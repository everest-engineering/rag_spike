CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 99-year-old woman previously admitted in 2010 for an episode of unresponsiveness, followed by left sided weakness, and then in 2012 for an episode of aphasia.  Past history of stroke with chronic right hemiparesis.  The patient has now had 2 episodes of 5 seconds of screaming, followed by tonic extension, and then 1 hour of postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Keppra, glipizide, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized.  An alpha rhythm of 50 Hz 70 mV was identified.  As the patient becomes drowsy there is a small amount of shifting slowing.  Stage 1 sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 BPM, occasionally irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a minimally abnormal EEG for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a previous EEG in 2010 where both EEGs demonstrated 8 Hz alpha rhythm of 50-70 mV.  No epileptiform features were noted.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
Of note, in this individual with a stroke and hemiparesis, no focal features were noted.
