CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed gentleman admitted on the 6th with
acute change in mental status, TIA versus cortical stroke enrolled in the point study.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Plavix.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha
rhythm. As the patient becomes drowsy, there is shifting slowing in the right or left
temporal region. There is wicket which is a normal variant identified bilaterally and a
question of a single right anterior temporal sharp wave. Features of sleep include vertex
waves, occasional bursts of delta and rare spindles. Sleep is sustained. Photic
stimulation elicits an alerting response and scant driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional shifting slowing.
CLINICAL There are no definitive epileptiform features although
there is some wicket activity. This shifting slowing is a nonspecific finding in a subject of
this age and can be seen in the context of underlying cerebrovascular disease. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study is suggested.
