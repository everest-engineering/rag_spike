CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman with hypothyroidism, migraine headaches, previous history of fibromyalgia, admitted with pain, myalgias, dysphoria, and intermittent weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Toradol, tramadol, topiramate.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is a technically acceptable record with impedances generally under 5 kilo ohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.  Brief stage 2 sleep with spindles were noted.
There is a subtle abnormality noted with subtle disruption of faster frequency activity from the left frontotemporal regions noted as the patient transitions towards drowsiness.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due to a subtle asymmetry with subtle focal features in the left hemisphere noted only in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The findings described above may be correlated with imaging and clinical history.
