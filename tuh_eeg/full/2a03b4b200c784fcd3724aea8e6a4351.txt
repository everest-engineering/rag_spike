CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed woman with orthostatic hypotension, insomnia, and a left carotid aneurysm.  The patient has now developed multiple episodes of loss of consciousness without shaking, but with eye twitching.  The patient may demonstrate strange behavior during these spells.  The patient can be aggressive during these spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm and generous, low voltage, frontal central beta.
During hyperventilation the patient reported feeling that her left side felt heavy and her left face was drooping, but the EEG demonstrated a normal awake pattern.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The event in the lab was not associated with clinical symptoms that were apparent to the tech.  No EEG changes were observed.  If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study may be obtained.
