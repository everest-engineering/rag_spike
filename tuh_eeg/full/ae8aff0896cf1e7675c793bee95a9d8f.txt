CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 30-year-old gentleman status post cranioplasty, who presents with shaking and suspected seizures.  He has a history of TBI on 10/26/2012.  His last seizure was on 03/21/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with additional single-lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There are almost continuous left temporal slowing at F7/T3 during wakefulness and sleep, consisting of 2-3 Hz delta frequency.  There are also focal slow waves seen independently in the bilateral frontal regions almost continuously throughout the recording at 3-4 Hz.  Hyperventilation results in accentuation of slowing, most pronounced on the left side.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and resulted in a driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to bifrontal slowing and left temporal slowing.  No epileptiform activities or seizures are identified in this recording.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings are suggestive of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral frontal regions and left temporal regions, which is consistent with a known history of TBI.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen or captured.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
