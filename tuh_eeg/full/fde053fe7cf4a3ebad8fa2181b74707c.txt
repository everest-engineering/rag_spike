59 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ SINCE 1971 S/P HEAD INJURY, DX WITH HEP C 1980. EEG TO EVAL DUE TO MED CONFLICT FROM HEP C. PT LAST SZ X 1 YR AGO ( GRAND MAL)
DILANTIN
Routine, awake & drowsy
International  10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1!T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation , photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional
information.
