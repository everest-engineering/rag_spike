CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old male with a long history of epilepsy since childhood, paranoid schizophrenia, occasional convulsions. The patient had a seizure at the top of the stairs and had a severe C-spine injury, now in hard collar. He is right handed.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zofran, Seroquel, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized and includes a mixed frequency pattern, rich in 6Hz theta, some 10 Hz alpha frequency activity, small amount of delta and a moderate amount of beta. In this critically ill individual, as he drifts off to sleep, there is a prominent increase in background slowing as well as beta. There is the suggestion of an underlying frontally predominate spike and slow-wave complex as well as some shifting asymmetries from either hemisphere.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing, disorganized background.
2. Subtle, but underlying frontal spike and wave activity which may be unilateral or bilateral and is somewhat asymmetric.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: To more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a review of his pre-injury EEG is appropriate, or alternatively, a follow-up study after he leaves the ICU and his sedative hypnotic medications are discontinued.
