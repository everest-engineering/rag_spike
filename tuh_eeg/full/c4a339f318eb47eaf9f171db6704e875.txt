Medications:	ASPIRIN,TENOZMIN,CHOLECALCFEROL,KEPPRA,ANTIVERT
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral mid temporal
regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At times the left temporal slowing
appears to become monomorphic and a have increase in amplitude and slow down in frequency
for less than 10 seconds with no clinical correlate. However the patient not been tested at that point
in time.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 72
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing seen
independently in the bilateral midtemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural
lesions in those regions.  Please note that there were some slightly rhythmic left temporal
discharges with no clinical correlate. If concern remains a repeat EEG with testing may helpful in
