CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 28-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy.  The patient was reportedly abusing drugs on December 3 and had multiple seizures throughout the day and finally found by the boyfriend who found her in cardiac arrest, started chest compressions and called EMS.  Presented comatose.  Tox screen positive for cocaine and Xanax.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Digital EEG was performed after 11:00 AM on the 4th.  The was described as intubated, comatose with poorly reactive pupils.  No involuntary movements were noted during the video EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes some muscle artifact.  The patient appears to be tachypneic.  There is a suppressed pattern with ventilator artifact approximately every 15 seconds There are a bursts of high amplitude generalized activity with delta.  The bursts are typically 0.4 seconds in duration.  On most occasions there is an isolated burst every 15 to 30 seconds but on rare occasions there may be 2 or 3 of the bursts.
Tactile stimulation did not activate the record.
2 mg of Versed was given which did not alter the record.
Heart rate 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to
Burst suppression pattern with primarily a pattern of suppression.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG recorded more than 12 hours after anoxic injury and without the use of sedative hypnotic medications carries a worrisome prognosis.  These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
