CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old gentleman with epilepsy, seizures occur every 5 years, last occurring 8 years ago.  Patient falls back and awake, is able to speak several minutes after the seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, Mevacor, others.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was performed.  This is primarily in a awaken, drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a vigorous, 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Central Mu activity was noted, but testing was not performed to confirm this.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record significantly.
Photic stimulation did not elicit a significant driving response.
Heart rate 66 bpm, occasionally slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  This is the 2nd normal EEG for this individual.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat or more prolonged study may be of use.
