History:	54 year old woman who presents after Baclofen overdose.  She was observed to
have 2 episodes consisting of pelvic thrusting, thrashing on the bed.
Medications:	Ativan PRN episodes
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of burst-suppression with burst-to-
suppression ratio of ~ 1:1-1:2.  Bursts consists of moderate-to-high amplitude polymorphic delta
activity that sometimes has triphasic appearance.  Additionally, occasionally, generalized frontally
predominant spikes with aftergoing slow waves are captured within the bursts.  No normal sleep
architecture is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, occasional
Burst-suppression pattern, 1:1 to 1:2 ratio
Spikes, occasional generalized
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL comatose portable 28 minute EEG due to mild burst-suppression pattern
and occasional epileptiform discharges that are present within the bursts. Burst-suppression is
indicative of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive
of a metabolic origin.  There is generalized cortical excitability.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures are present.  A typical event was observed after the recording was stopped, therefore it was
not captured on this EEG.  Patient will be placed on continuous EEG monitoring.
