History:	69 YO FEMALE PRESENTS TO TUH BY EMS FOR AMS.PT HAS NO
RECOLLECTION OF WHY SHE IS IN HOSPITAL. PMHX: HTN, IDDMII, ETOH
Medications:	INSULIN, DILTIAZEM, FOLATE, ISOSORBIDE, LOVENOX, LISINOPRIL, COREG,
HYDRALAZINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse delta
and at times theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some of the waveforms have a triphasic morphology.  There is some variability to the
background.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
