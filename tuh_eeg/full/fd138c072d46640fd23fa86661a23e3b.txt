YR PERIOD OF SZ FREE. LAST SZ 11/24/13. PT HAS AURA OF DIZZINESS,SOB,
B/L TINGLING
Medications:	 DILANTIN, AMIODIPINE, PRAVASTATIN.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 20-30uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces minimal
effects.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic
driving at all flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
