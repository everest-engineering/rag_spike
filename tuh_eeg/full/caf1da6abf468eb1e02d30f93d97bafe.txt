History:	75 year old admitted with a transient left facial droop.
Medications:	No AEDs Sedation:
EEG Type: Technique:
Awake & asleep
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During brief stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal- frontocentral region. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left, mild-to-moderate, anterior temporal - frontocentral Cardiac arrhythmia
No epileptiform discharges Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly asleep 22 minute EEG due to occasional focal slowing in the
left anterior temporal- frontocentral region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of
epilepsy.
