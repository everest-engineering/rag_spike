CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left MCA aneurysm for craniotomy clip.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Versed, fentanyl, flurane.
INTRODUCTION:  Intraoperative monitoring was performed using an alternative montage.  Electrode placement was modified as this was a craniotomy study.  F3, C3, P3 were all moved down into the right in order to provide coverage.  This is a 3-hour and 21-minute EEG.
This recording was monitored with physician remote review as physician unavailable at all times.  Remote review included the 30 minutes during the placement of the clamp with 1 on 1 physician remote review as well as an additional 30 minutes prior to the interventionist.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates an anesthetic pattern, rich in faster frequency activities as well as smaller amounts of delta with intermittent attenuation.
The carotid is manipulated with clamps placed and readjusted from 10:20 to 11 a.m.  During this time, no changes are noted in the background EEG.  Electrode coverage is, however, most supported in the right hemisphere rather than the left given the operative limitations.
At 11 a.m., there is a change in anesthesia to isoflurane, which produces an increase in delta.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Intraoperative monitoring during this left MCA aneurysm clip demonstrated no significant focal features with placement of a clip.
