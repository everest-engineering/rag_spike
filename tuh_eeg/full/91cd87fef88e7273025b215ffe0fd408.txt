CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed woman with migraine and hypertension.
Evaluate for headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, HCTZ, Triamterene, Nasonex
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a 10.5 Hz, 30 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount
of low voltage frontal central beta activity. In relaxed wakefulness and in
hyperventilation there is occasional, isolated bursts, of arrhythmic 3-5 Hz activity in the left to right temporal region. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Occasional arrhythmic delta activity in the temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen, however, deeper
stages of sleep were not identified. These findings should be correlated with history
and imaging. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing sleep
is suggested.
