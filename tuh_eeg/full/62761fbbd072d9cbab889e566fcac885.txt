History:	44 YR FEMALE CC APHASIA/RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS. [PT WITH SEIZURE 3/28.).
METASTATIC BREAST CA, S/P CHEMO, DOUBLE MASTECTOMY, S/P WHOLE
BRAIN RX.  MULTI CNS LESIONS
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous attenuation of the left hemisphere is noted.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of left hemisphere continuous attenuation. This is consistent
with a cortical lesion involving this region or alternatively it may be seen with a fluid collection over
the region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
