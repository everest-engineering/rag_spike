History:	57 YR FEMALE WITH CC SEVERE HA AND WITNESSED GTC SZ IN ER. PT BECAME INCOHERENT AND HA, VOMITED. PMHX; CAD, CABG 02, AFIB, HTN, HLD,  CT. MULTI FOCAL VASOGENIC EDEMA  B/L SUPRATENTORIALLY AND MITRALTENTARIALLY (?) METS VS ABSCESS. LEFTWARD SHIFT.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  At time it appears to be slightly monomorphic but lacks any evolution.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, maximal midtemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere maximal in the midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
