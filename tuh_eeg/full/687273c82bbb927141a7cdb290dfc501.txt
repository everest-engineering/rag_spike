CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old woman with new onset seizures associated with
hyperglycemia.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Fentanyl, Vecuronium, Dilantin
Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very slow,
featureless record with primarily delta frequency activity. There is a significant amount
of EKG artifact. There is a slight asymmetry in the delta. There is a bit more higher
amplitude rhythmic delta activity in the left frontal region compared to the right. There is
some shifting asymmetries. The delta on the right is a bit slower. There is also an
amplitude asymmetry in this bedside recording. The activity is somewhat lower on the
right compared to the left. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 116 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. An asymmetry with somewhat higher amplitude delta activity on the left compared
to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of
cerebral function. Because of the asymmetry on the left frontal central region,
correlation imaging is suggested.
