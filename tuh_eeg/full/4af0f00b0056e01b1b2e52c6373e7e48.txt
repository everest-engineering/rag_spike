CLINICAL HISTORY: 7 4 year old with memory loss, head trauma, and epilepsy but
seizure-free for the last 24 years
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Pravastatin, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is observed to have a
significant bilateral frontal craniotomy defect.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is somewhat
drowsy with a low voltage pattern. The background in wakefulness includes a low
voltage pattern with an 8 Hz alpha rhythm. There is rhythmic frontal slowing and
occasional bursts of shifting slowing as well as significant electrode artifact. Despite the
artifacts, a bilateral photic driving response is noted.
HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. This is a low
voltage record, but that is not considered pathological in an adult of this age. If epilepsy
is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be
helpful. The background slowing may be due to his head trauma or underlying age related
memory problems.
