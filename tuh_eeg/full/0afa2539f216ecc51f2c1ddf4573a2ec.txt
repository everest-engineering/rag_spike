CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 72-year-old male with right carotid, posterior wall aneurysm, after the takeoff of the ophthalmic artery.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, sevoflurane, Heparin, Rocuronium, Aspirin, Fentanyl, Neuromuscular blockade, Phenylephrine, Versed, and ReoPro.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in the angiography suite using standard carotid montage with one channel of EKG.  This was a 2-hour EEG with initially awake patient with subsequently sedated.  This EEG had 1 hour 45 minutes physician remote review and 15 minutes physician review in the angiography suite.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient is awake with symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Anesthetic medications were initiated and by 9:24, the EEGs intermittently discontinuous.  Anesthetic medications were adjusted.  The patient was received propofol at 9:35.  The intermittent discontinuity was discussed with the clinical team.
ReoPro was given at 10:20.  The catheter was in place, but no intervention was utilized.  No changes in the EEG were noted with placement of the catheter or manipulation of the catheter.  The study concluded at 9:54.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION AND CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this right carotid angiogram was remarkable for transiently discontinuous pattern, but no significant focal slowing.
