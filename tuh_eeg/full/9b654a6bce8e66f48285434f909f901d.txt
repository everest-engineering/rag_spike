History:	44 year old man who had a convulsion and later was found to be unresponsive.  He
has a history of seizures and is generally non-compliant with Dilantin due to
Medications:	Depakote, tylenol #3
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-9.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
