CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed female with change in mental status, followed by tonic clonic seizures on October 16, 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, Keppra, ASA, Lovenox, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was declined, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a somewhat disorganized pattern with an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm, generous frontal beta, and a small amount of background theta. Bursts of FIRDA are noted. In the transition towards the sleep, there is a bit more rhythmic slowing in the left frontal region compared to the right. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR: 108 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Mild background slowing.
3. FIRDA.
4. Left frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Correlation with this patient's history and imaging may be helpful regarding the FIRDA and the focal features.
