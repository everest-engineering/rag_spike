CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed woman with schizophrenia with a recent seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Clozaril
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz, which appears to be more reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely throughout the recording throughout the anterior and posterior electrodes.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness.  Photic stimulation really produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves seen at 5 to 7 Hz frequently while in wakefulness, in addition to intermittent bursts of generalized sharply contoured delta intermixed with theta frequently seen throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
