CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old man found down unresponsive in the ER.  He was given dextrose in the emergency room. Patient is now intubated and unresponsive.  No past medical history.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan given, Dilaudid, Lovenox, Famotidine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and an excessive amount of diffuse beta throughout the recording.  There was no normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were  performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-30 microvolts were seen throughout the recording.  There was also an excessive amount of beta seen throughout the EEG and no clear focalities.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
