CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old gentleman with epilepsy, history of head trauma, history of brain tumor. The patient was admitted with mental status changes and left the hospital abruptly.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Depakote, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is quite abnormal and disorganized. In addition, there is an asymmetry. From the left hemisphere, the activity is slower with more disruption of faster frequency activity. Focal delta is noted throughout the left, which is sharply contoured at T1.
The right hemisphere demonstrates more of an alpha rhythm at 8-9 hertz, 40 to 50 microvolts.
As the patient becomes drowsy, more arrhythmic delta is noted from the left hemisphere.
Other features of drowsiness include bilateral delta. Generous beta is noted.
Photic stimulation does elicit scant driving from the right.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly frontal and temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this sharply contoured record, there are no definitive sharp waves.
In comparison to previous records, epileptiform activity, FIRDA and focal features are not as prominent.
