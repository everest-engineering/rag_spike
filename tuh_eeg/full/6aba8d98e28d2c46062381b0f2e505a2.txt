CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman with memory impairment and dizziness.
MEDICATIONS: Motrin, Simvastatin, Benadryl, Klonopin, Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed. The patient is quite anxious.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hertz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response. Hyperventilation increases the amplitude.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were noted. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
