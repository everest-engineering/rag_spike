History:	63 YR OLD FEMALE  R HANDED.TAKEN FROM HOME BY DAUGHTER FOR A
WITNESSED SZ. WHERE PT. WAS SHAKING. PT.WAS GETTING READY FOR A
DIALYSIS VISIT. PMHX. ESRD, HTN, CVA W/ RESIDUAL L LEG  WEAKNESS,
HEART FAILURE.58 CM HEAD
Medications:	HEPARIN, KEPPRA, DILANTIN.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by a very
disorganized diffuse high voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology
are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase
lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and
amplitude maximum at C4.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, occasional, right central
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Triphasic waves, intermittent generalized, frontal predominant
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  occasional epileptiform discharges in the right central
region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region. In addition
there is  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing and
disorganization.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  No clinical or electrographic
