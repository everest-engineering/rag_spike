CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unknown male found in respiratory distress following aspiration.  Patient suffered NSTEMI metabolic acidosis.  Patient was treated with an Ativan drip until 2 hours prior to this EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Levophed, Zosyn, thiamine, and vancomycin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was generally, a technically satisfactory record for an intubated unresponsive patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  Initially, the EEG is low voltage slow with delta, which is somewhat rhythmic.  This is intermittently interrupted by more rhythmic theta and beta pattern.  As the recording continues, spontaneous arousals are noted with the patient demonstrating eye movements and more of an alpha theta pattern.  On 1 brief occasion, an 8 hertz alpha rhythm is glimpsed.
Heart rate: 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal, but dynamic EEG due to,
Background slowing with intermittent delta.
Dynamic pattern with an overall slow pattern, but delta alternating with beta-theta pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  For this individual who was poorly responsive, this EEG demonstrates positive prognostic features with clear evidence of spontaneous arousal, eye movement, and a glimpse of alpha activity.  This EEG is most supportive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, although other diffuse brain dysfunction is a consideration.
