History:	60 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS ON 12/14/15 WITH H/O FOUND DOWN AND
ALTERED WITH SEVERE TRAUMATIC ICH AND SKULL FX. POD # 4 RT CRANI
AND LEFT FRONTAL EVD. PT WAS NOTED WITH RT UPPER GAZE
12/17- PRIOR EEG
12/21 - EEG TO R/O SZ PT CONT. TO HAVE RIGHT EYE GAZE
Medications:	INSULIN, ZOSYN, KEPPRA, FAMOTIDINE, VANCOMYCIN, TYLENOL, ATIVAN AT
604 AM ON 12/21 2 MG , PROPOFOL 5 MG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies. There is frequent intermittent diffuse attenuation seen.  No normal sleep architecture
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right frontal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  This is at times sharply countoured. There is an asymmetry with
increased amplitude over this region consistent with a breach.  No epileptiform discharges are
present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 102 irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontal,  associated breach.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right frontal region.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition there is severe  diffuse
background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
