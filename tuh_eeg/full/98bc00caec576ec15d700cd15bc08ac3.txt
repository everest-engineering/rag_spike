History:	49 YO FEMALE AMS, LETHARGIC AT HOME, MORE ASLEEP THAN AWAKE
PMHX: DM, PYODERMA, DEPRESSION
Medications:	PROTONIX, LABETOLOL, INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, drowsy, asleep, lethargic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, well-formed on the left
side, which attenuates with eye opening.  Beta activity is present, maximal in left frontotemporal
region.  Excess theta activity is noted during brief periods of wakefulness.  There are bursts of 2.5 Hz
frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Almost continuous polymorphic delta and theta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant
region maximum at T2 and F8 during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 100 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Asymmetry, beta, well-formed on the left
Alpha rhythm, well-formed on the left
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, Excess theta during wakefulness
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and bursts of frontal intermittent
rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).  These findings are indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
is etiologically nonspecific. FIRDA bursts could also be seen in increased intracranial pressure or
midline mass lesion of brain.  continuous focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant region.  This
finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.
