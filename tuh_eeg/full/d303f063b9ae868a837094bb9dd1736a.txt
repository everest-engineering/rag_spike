CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old right handed female who has a history of strokes in
2007 with subsequent seizures. She was complaining of lightheadedness. She denied any further seizure activity since 2007.

MEDICATIONS:  Citalopram, Enalapril, Atenolol, Lovastatin, Aggrenox, Roxicet, hydrochlorothiazide, Glipizide, Oxycodone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, but there is 9.5 hertz symmetric reactive alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Rare, isolated right or left temporal theta/delta is noted in drowsiness.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:	66 bpm


IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features were noted. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, but at present, the patient is symptom free off
seizure medications.
