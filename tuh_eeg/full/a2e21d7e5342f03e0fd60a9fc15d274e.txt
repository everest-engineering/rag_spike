CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed male with left sided weakness, right
frontal vasogenic edema.
MEDICATION: None listed in chart
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is drowsy. Photic
stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern
with a posterior dominant rhythm of 5-7 Hz. Vertex waves are observed in stage I
sleep. There is a small amount of shifting slowing and slightly higher amplitude delta in
the right frontal region. Some of this includes a triangular right frontal complex. On rare
occasions there is a right frontal polyspike component. Photic stimulation does no
activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Moderate generalized background slowing.
2. Rare right frontal delta, sharp waves, and polyspike activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. The subtle right frontal features may be correlated with imaging.
