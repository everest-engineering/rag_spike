HISTORY:
A 45-year-old woman with a stroke in February 2011, right-sided weakness now with episode to right sided coldness,
paroxysmal weakness, slurred speech, and eyes rolling back. The patient was treated with seizure medications, but
cannot identify them.
INTRODUCTION:
Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one-channel EKG.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. The overall EEG
is relatively low voltage Hyperventilation is performed earlier on the record and accentuates data from the central region
It also accentuates the overall amplitude of the background Photic stimulation elicits the scant driving.
Heart rate 70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:
This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due toÂ·
1. Mild slowing of the background
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No epileptiform features were identified. This is the second normal EEG for th1s patient If epilepsy is an important
consideration, e repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
