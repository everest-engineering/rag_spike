CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old woman, status post gastric bypass surgery, PTSD syndrome.  The patient has drop attacks sometimes with incontinence for which she is amnestic. Chronically hypersomnolent.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lasix, Coumadin, thyroid, Ativan 1 mg q.12 h., and Effexor
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG and seizure and spike detection software.  No clinical events were noted.  No electrographic seizures were identified by the software.  A practice push button was noted at 8 p.m.  This is a technically satisfactory study with appropriate impedances.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with generous beta, a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and lambda.  The patient is quite often sleepy and was sleeping, in stage 2 sleep during the day.
Possible REM sleep was noted at 136.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  The 1st 24 hours of EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
A very drowsy patient.
At least some suggestion of a disrupted sleep-wake cycle with the patient sleeping early during the day.
Additional EEG monitoring will continue.
