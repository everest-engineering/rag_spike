CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed female with history of seizures, noted to be having increased seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Topiramate
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed at bedside for 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system and additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact of T3 intermittently throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There appears to be stage changes, but the typical sleep architecture is seen.   No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Multifocal spikes are seen in multiple locations including T3, F3, C3 as well as P4, F4, T4 as well as intermittent burst of diffuse or generalized delta activity are seen throughout the recording, some with spikes in between, but some of them with just bursts of slowing.
Generalized slow waves, excessive theta in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.  The patient had reported 2 seizure events overnight, however, could not remember when.  The whole EEG was reviewed personally by me and I did not find any seizures in the recording.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Multifocal spikes.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from multiple foci.  No seizures were recorded.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.
