CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old male status post anaphylactic injury to shellfish ingestion on the 29th, intubated, multisystem injury, and MI x2.  The patient had seizure-like activity on presentation on the 29th.
MEDICATIONS:  Midazolam and propofol.  Previously treated with Decadron fentanyl and Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was comatose, unresponsive and was examined during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  The overall pattern is one of diffuse delta with slow delta and bursts of frontally predominant delta.  In addition, there is prominent beta noted in the background.  The patient was examined on 2 occasions.  On 1 occasion, there was a subtle increase in rhythmic delta which is a little bit faster, trending more towards 3 Hz was noted when the patient was  unstimulated.  Tactile stimulation at the very end of the EEG also produced a little bit of reactivity.
Heart rate 102 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Absence of the normal wave forms.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although reactivity to external stimuli was subtle it was present and this is a positive prognostic factor.  Of note, this patient's sedative hypnotic medications can play a role in the pattern described above.
