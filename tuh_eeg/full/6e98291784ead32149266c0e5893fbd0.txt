CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of multiple strokes with resultant left hemiparesis and spasticity with reported daily generalized tonoclonic convulsions.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Catapres, Lexapro.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient, with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep vertex waves,  sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  Frequent polymorphic theta and delta activity at lower amplitudes are captured over the right mid temporal region.  Hyperventilation is not performed. Photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent moderate right mid temporal slowing.
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform charges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 23 minute EEG due to intermittent moderate right mid temporal slowing.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction, likely structural, in  this patient is consistent with a prior history of a right MCA territory stroke.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.
