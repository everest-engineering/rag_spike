CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed female with renal failure, pancreatitis, asthma, epilepsy and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Nephrocaps, Zocor, Dilaudid, ASA, Advair, Dopamine, Norepinephrine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient appears to be quite ill. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing beings, the patient is cachectic with the neck hyperextended and eyes deviated slightly to the right. The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with slow, futureless delta, eye movement and some triphasic waves. Artifact is noted at T4 throughout the record. Single channel artifact in T4 and F4. As the patient becomes drowsy, there are increasing bursts of rhythmic delta and better quality sections of the record demonstrate shifting asymmetries but not prominent asymmetries.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
