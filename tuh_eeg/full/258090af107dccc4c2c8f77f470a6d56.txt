History:	52 YO FEMALE WITH BODY TWITCHING FROM HEAD, SHOULDERS, ARMS AND
LEGS W/O LOC. STAR IN JANUARY OF 2014 OCCURRING AT LEAST ONCE A
DAY
PMHX: HERNIA, HYSTERECTOMY. ASTHMA, HTN, GERD,
Medications:	VALIUM, PRINZIDE/ ZESTORETIC, ZOCOR, TRAMADOL, OTHERS
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
66  During the record the patient exhibits intermittent head jerking towards the left. On three
occasions the jerking to the left becomes rhythmic and last for 4-8 seconds.  The EEG only reveals a
myogenic correlate but no electrographic correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing
independently seen in the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  The episodes of head jerking had no EEG
correlate and as such may represent non-epileptic spells, however simple partial seizures may only
have an EEG correlate in 25% of the cases.
