CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old man with a history of dementia, stroke, with multiple lacunar infarcts, CAD, status post catheterization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, triple abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 1996, and now small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lorazepam, Morphine, Lovenox, Protonix, ASA, Nystatin, Zetia.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed, but only photic stimulation was able to be done.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz, which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen during the limited wakefulness.  The patient appears to go into stage I and stage II sleep during the recording.  He easily goes into sleep. Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen during limited wakefulness at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Intermittent T4 slowing seen at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral temporal slowing.
Mild generalized slowing in limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in both temporal lobes, in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
