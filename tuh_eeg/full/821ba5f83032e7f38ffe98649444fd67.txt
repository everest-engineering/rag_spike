CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old right handed male with a history of glaucoma, pericarditis, hypertension, anemia, pericardial effusion, and past medical history of seizures, had several seizures recently after stopping his seizure medication.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Lovastatin, Travoprost.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 to 11 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
mild focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
