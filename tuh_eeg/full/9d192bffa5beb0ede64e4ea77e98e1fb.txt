CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old woman, currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Lamictal, Lexapro, Prevacid.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz 40 mV alpha rhythm with generous low voltage, frontal central beta.  Wicket is noted.  In addition, in hyperventilation there is some additional focal slowing with 3-4 Hz activity, primarily in the left temporal region, but on rare occasions it is in the right temporal region.   Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and anterior spread of the alpha. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Isolated, left greater than right, temporal focal slowing which is a bit slower than wicket.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's 2007 EEG is available for comparison and did not identify epileptiform activity, but older EEGs in the data base have.  The
temporal features described above did not include sharp waves or spikes and a relatively nonspecific finding in an adult with epilepsy.
