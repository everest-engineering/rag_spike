History:	37 YR OLD  RH MAN. PT STATES HE HAS A 2 TUMORS IN HIS RIGHT SIDE
TEMPORAL AREA. 31 RADIATION TREATMENTS, ALSO GAMMA KNIFE.
TREATMENT IS EVERY 2 WEEKS. 56 CM HEAD
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal in the mid to
posterior temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, maximal in the mid to posterior
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right hemisphere maximal in the mid to posterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region, which is consistent with the known history of tumors in these
region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
