CLINICAL HISTORY:   36 year old male with HIV and diagnosis of cryptococcal infection in the CSF, as well as cystic lung disease, acute kidney insufficiency, and 2 episodes of unresponsiveness.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Oxacillin, Fluconazole, Amphotericin B.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic to obtunded.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Marked temporalis muscle artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a frequency of 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 mV.  This frequency does not appear to improve with stimulation.  There is no normal frontal central beta activity seen.  No normal sleep architecture is also seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:    None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  It may be seen due to bilateral white matter disease, toxic metabolic or infectious encephalopathies, or at times due to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
