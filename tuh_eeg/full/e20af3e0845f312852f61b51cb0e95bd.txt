History:	66 YR. OLD FEMALE R HANDED HUSBAND BROUGHT PT INTO ED. LETHARGIC
NOT ORIENTED PT HAD A SEIZURE.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 15-20uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Rapid eye movements can be seen along with saw tooth
waves consistent with REM sleep.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the C4 region.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and mainly in sleep EEG because of continuous focal
slowing in the right central region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
