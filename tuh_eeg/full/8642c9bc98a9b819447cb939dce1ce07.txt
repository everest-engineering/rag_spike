CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 75-year-old female, who was admitted with right-sided weakness of the right upper and lower extremities, and right side of the face.  Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, history of Parkinson's, and emphysema.
MEDICATIONS:  Ceftriaxone, Zocor, pantoprazole.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the background activity is characterized by diffuse slowing consisting of 6-7 Hz theta activity intermixed with 2-3 Hz delta activity with almost symmetrical distribution.  There is intermittent frontally predominant alpha activity with a frequency of 8 Hz.  There is spontaneous variability and reactivity to stimulation during physical examination of the patient by physician noted.  There is no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures noted during this recording.  Heart rate was 60-70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to diffuse slowing of the background with theta and delta activity seen in lethargic state.  There are no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The above findings could be due to metabolic, toxic, hypoxic, or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of sedating medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction or degenerative brain disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a repeat EEG or continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
