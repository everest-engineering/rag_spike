CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old male with a history of epilepsy since childhood.  He has been seizure-free and off of antiepileptic medication since age 15.  He was seizure-free until three years ago when he felt something that he described as a warm feeling on his forehead for about several seconds.  He may or may not have been confused, but he never lost consciousness.  He states that these events happen only whenever he drinks.  He usually drinks beer every other day, about 40 ounces.  His last use of cocaine was December 2002.  Past medical history of depression, epilepsy, and hepatitis C.
MEDICATIONS: Antidepressants including amitriptyline, Benztropine, and Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the Long-Term EEG Monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric with a lot of muscle artifact during the daytime.  There is a 9 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm. In random sleep, he went to bed at about 21:16 with lights off, but he went to sleep at about 01:10.  His sleeping structure was fragmented by frequent awakenings.  His sleeping was evidenced by vertex waves, slow rolling eye movements, a mixed frequency of brain waves, and a few spindles.  Occasional increased delta activity in stage III sleep was seen, but this was not sustained.
EVENTS:  No events or seizure activity was recorded during this period of the record.
HR:  102 BPM.
Long-Term Monitoring, 11/06/03 at 08:15 – 11/07/03 at 06:28
CLINICAL HISTORY: No events reported.
MEDICATIONS: Antidepressants including amitriptyline, Benztropine, and Zyprexa.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the Long-Term EEG Monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is symmetric with a 9 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm. During the day, there is a lot of muscle movement artifact.  Hyperventilation was performed early on for about four minutes, which was adequate.  Post hyperventilation, the patient complains of being dizzy, but no episodes, no seizure activity, or EEG changes were seen.  In random sleep, the patient slept better than the previous night.  Sleeping is evidenced by slow rolling eye movements, vertex waves, mixed frequency brain waves, spindles, and K complexes.  Stage III sleep occurred several times, but this was not sustained.
EVENTS:  No events, push button events, or seizure activity were recorded during this period of the record.
HR:  102 BPM.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the Long-Term EEG Monitoring unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is symmetric and low voltage. There is a 9 Hz, 20 V posterior dominant alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient did not sleep during this portion of the record.  No asymmetries or focal findings were seen during this period.
HR:  114 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal long-term EEG monitoring.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Over the last five days of this long-term EEG monitoring, no focal or epileptiform features were recorded.  As mentioned in the history, when we talked to the patient today, he stated that the episodes in question only happen when he drinks alcohol.  Therefore, his episodes are most likely secondary to alcohol ingestion and less likely epileptogenic.  The patient was advised to reduce or eliminate his alcohol use.  However, normal EEG does not exclude the possibility of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, a follow-up study may be helpful if the patient continues to have episodes even after stopping alcohol use.
