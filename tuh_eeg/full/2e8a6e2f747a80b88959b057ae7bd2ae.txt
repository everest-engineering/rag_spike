AGE: 67 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY : 10/06/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1466
HISTORY :
67 y.o. male who presented with loss of consciousness and was found to be dehydrated with pulmonary EMBOLI.
MEDICATIONS:
Heparin atorvastatin
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system . This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a low voltage mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 102 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected. A low voltage record is a normal variant in the adult population .
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
