History:	48 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF CVA X2 WITH SUBSEQUENT SZS, ANXIETY.
PRESENTS WITH SZS.  PMHS: SZS, CVA, ETOH ABUSE, ADM ETOH 230,
PHENOBARB 30.2, DILANTIN 10.6
Medications:	Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Lorazepam, Prozac
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess beta activity is present diffusely.  During drowsiness, the
background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the
alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further
to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 70
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. There is excess beta activity throughout the
study which is normal but can be seen with use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
