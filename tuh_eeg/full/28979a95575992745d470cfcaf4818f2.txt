CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  During this section of the EEG monitoring, the patient had episodes of disequilibrium, but none of her typical complex partial seizures or simple partial seizures with olfactory aura.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Seizures:  None.
Pushbuttons:  Only practice pushbutton detections.
Interictal epileptiform detections:  In the transition from wakefulness into stage 2 sleep, there are occasional independent right or left temporal sharp waves.  These stand out from the background although they are discrete.  They have a somewhat more generous field of spread than 1 might expect for a benign epileptiform variant.  It may occur in pairs.  They are overall, quite rare and are less remarkable than in the baseline.  In stage 2 sleep at times, there is a suggestion of a breach rhythm noted at the vertex.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  There is no impression or clinical correlation because EEG recording continues.
