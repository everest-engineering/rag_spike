History:	83 year woman with a history of stroke and atrial fibrillation, now presents with a first
seizure.

Patient is agitated and moves a lot throughout the study.  Please note that
impedances are high.
Medications:	Haldol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The background over the left does not have PDR or AP gradient and consists of a mixture of
polymorphic theta and Delta activity.  The background over the right consists of a very unstable 7-
7.5 Hz PDR, weak AP gradient, excess theta and delta activity and underriding fast frequencies over
the parietal region.  Patient remains awake throughout the study.
No clear seizures are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG demonstrates irregular
heart rate.  Patient is agitated and moves a lot throughout the study.  Please note that impedances
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric, moderate-to-severe
Breach artifact, right parietal
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake only 23-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and continuous
moderate-to-severe focal left hemispheric slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing is indicative of a
focal structural lesion in this region.  Suspect breach artifact in the right parietal region.  Breach
artifact indicates skull defect.  Patient is agitated and moves throughout the recording.  Subtle
findings could have been missed.
