History:	55 year old woman with a history of seizures since childhood and prior strokes.
Patient woke up confused.
Medications:	Ativan, benadryl
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm is very unstable and fragmented at ~ 8-10 Hz polymorphic activity.
AP gradient is weak.  Diffuse excess theta activity and frequent busts of diffuse frontally
predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) are captured.  Patient remains awake throughout the
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), frequent
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 23-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) could be seen in encephalopathy,
increased ICP, bilateral deep white matter lesions.
