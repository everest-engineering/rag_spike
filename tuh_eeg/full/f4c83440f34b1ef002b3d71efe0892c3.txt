CLINICAL HISTORY: 17 year old right handed female with onset of absence epilepsy
February 2010 with absence and tonic-clonic seizures, now seizure-free since February.
The patient is no longer having fevers, sweats or tics.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized
for a child of this age, but there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with excess theta, some shifting
slowing. Rhythmic temporal 5 Hz activity, characteristic of rhythmic mid temporal theta
of drowsiness is noted, but there are no definite epileptiform features. Photic stimulation
elicits a bilateral driving response. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the
amplitude of the background which is overall symmetric. Brief sleep includes vertex
waves followed by arousal.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mildly disorganized pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no prominent epileptiform features noted today.
Overall this represents an improvement compared to previous studies.
