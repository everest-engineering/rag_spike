CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old right-handed male, admitted in February to Temple Hospital for dizziness.  Has a past history of childhood traumatic brain injury and dysconjugate eye movements.
MEDICATIONS:  Claritin, Prilosec, Lyrica, and Reglan.
INTRODUCTION:  A 26-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is a technically acceptable EEG, although there were some asymmetries noted particularly with the eye movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS were noted in sleep.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited trivial driving response.
Heart rate: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  If paroxysmal vertigo is thought to be an epileptiform process, a more prolonged study may be of use.
