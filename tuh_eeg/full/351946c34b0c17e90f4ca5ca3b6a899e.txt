CLINICAL HISTORY: 	28 year old right handed male with paranoid schizophrenia, history of an
MVA, and cardiac pathology.


MEDICATIONS:  Valproic Acid, Zocor, Metoprolol, Protonix, Plavix, Lopid Gemfibrozil, Atarax, Loxapine, Zoloft, Seroquel

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are completed. This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is abnormal. There is pattern of theta frequency activity with theta frequency posterior dominant rhythm interrupted by bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude, frontal delta.  Some of this notched, but none of it  is associated with epileptiform activity. Occasional right temporal focal slowing is observed.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Hyperventilation accentuates the right temporal focal slowing. In addition, right temporal sharp waves are noted during hyperventilation.

HR:	72 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Background slowing and disorganization.
2.	Right focal slowing accompanied with right temporal sharp waves.
3. 	FIRDA.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The focal slowing and sharp waves support a localization related mechanism for seizures.  The background slowing and FIRDA are nonspecific and may be due to this patient's  medications or underlying CNS disturbance.
