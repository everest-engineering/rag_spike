CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old right handed female with posterior gliosis.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Depakote, Celexa.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 alpha rhythm.  There is a slight asymmetry with a higher amplitude alpha on the left compared to the right.  There are occasional areas with focal slowing with delta, including C3, P3, or T5.  There is some occasional slowing in the right posterior region. Hyperventilation seems to increase the amplitude, particularly on the left. As the patient transitions towards drowsiness, there is disruption of the alpha rhythm and some posterior slowing.
During photic stimulation the patient seems to be drifting off to sleep and focal delta is noted in the posterior regions, left more so than right.  Sustained sleep is limited, but there is again some focality, a bit more left posterior temporal parietal.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.

HR:    60 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal, but markedly improved, EEG due to:
1. Appearance of a normal alpha rhythm.
2. Isolated focal slowing more in the posterior quadrants, left greater than right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No left frontal sharp waves were seen.  No seizures were recorded.  An elective EEG monitoring session might be needed to characterize this
patient's typical seizures.  Seizures following status epilepticus this past fall were localized to the left frontal temporal region.
