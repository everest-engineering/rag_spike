CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 42-year-old male with right craniotomy, seizure free for the past 1 year.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was a technically acceptable EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms.  The patient had a prominent craniotomy defect. Photic stimulation was completed.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown, not provided by nursing home.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized from the left hemisphere with a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is a prominent asymmetry between the two hemispheres.  The right hemisphere demonstrates more significant arrhythmic delta with disruption of faster frequency activity and disruption of the alpha rhythm.  This is prominent in the central and temporal regions, really throughout the right hemisphere.  There is suggestion of a breach rhythm with slight accentuation of activity, particularly at T4.
Intermittent, sharply contoured delta is noted again with phase reversal at C4 and T4.
Photic stimulation elicited by driving response on the left.
Heart rate:  66-72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
Sharply contoured slowing in the right central and temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray and white matter.  The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding in that region, although there were no definitive sharp waves or spikes, there was clear sharply contoured waves of greater than 200 milliseconds in the region of the previous surgery.
