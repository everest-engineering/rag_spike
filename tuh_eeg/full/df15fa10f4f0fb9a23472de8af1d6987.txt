History:	71 Y.O. FEMALE PRESENTING WITH TONGUE PAIN FOR 4 MONTHS, EPISODIC,
LAST FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES, ABOUT 4-5 TIMES PER DAY. EXTENSIVE
PAST MEDICAL HX.
Medications:	Tegretol, Oxycodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 42 minute EEG for age while awake, drowsy, and asleep. There is intermittent
focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is normal for her age.
