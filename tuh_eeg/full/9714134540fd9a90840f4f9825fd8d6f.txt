CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed man with a history of hypertension and essential tremor, presents to the lab with episodes of all of a sudden becoming rigid and tremulous and dysarthric without loss of consciousness.

MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, Lisinopril, HCTZ, Avapro, Norvasc.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T3 and T4 independently at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times at those regions there appears to be some sharply contoured theta activity, but not clear epileptiform or consistent with wickets.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent bitemporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral midtemporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
