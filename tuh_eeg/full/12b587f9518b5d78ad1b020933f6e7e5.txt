History:	56 year old female presenting with right hand and forearm shaking for 3 years since
repair of ROTATOR cuff. EEG is being performed to rule out
Medications:	Sinemet
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves
appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves and POSTS (positive occipital sharp
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  Right arm/ hand tremors are noted
throughout the recording.  They are not associated with an abnormal ictal correlate.
Summary of Findings:
POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep)
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Other, Right arm/ hand tremors are not associated with an abnormal ictal correlate.
Interpretation:
This is a an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG due to occasional moderate left
anterior temporal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  Right arm/ hand tremors are not
associated with an abnormal ictal correlate.
