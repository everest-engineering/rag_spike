History:	56 year old who presents with new onset seizures and change in mental status.
Medications:	KEPPRA, 2MG ATIVAN IV PUSH
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 08/14/2014 to 08/15/2014.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description: There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the right.  The background over the left hemisphere consist of low-to-moderate amplitude well formed and regulated 10 Hz PDR with preserved AP gradient.  The background over the right hemisphere is attenuated, especially over the lateral leads; PDR is unstable and fragmented at 9-10 Hz with poor AP gradient.  Additional polymorphic delta activity is present over the right temporal and right occipital  regions.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are noted. Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right hemisphere maximal midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No seizures or  epileptiform discharges
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic
Attenuation
Alpha rhythm, absent, right hemispheric
Interpretation: This is a very abnormal awake and asleep 24 hours EEG due to right hemisphere focal slow, absent PDR and attenuation.  This finding is indicative of  focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin and involving gray and white matter.
