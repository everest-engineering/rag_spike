CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed woman who presented to the hospital as a transfer after an exploratory laparotomy, found to be septic, now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Serax and Colace.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  However, she was mainly agitated on the recording.  Activating procedures could not be performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Increased movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a slow and disorganized background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness and slight drowsiness.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T4 and sometimes at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV seen frequently.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bitemporal slowing.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in both mid temporal lobes, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is also not specific in regards to etiology.   No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
