DATE OF STUDY:  February 11 through February 12.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with episodes of generalized spotty tremulousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, opioids, Effexor, many others, and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record in an individual with fragmented sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient receives opioids during the EEG and that may be producing the intermittent slowing of the alpha to 8 Hz.  Lambda and TOSTS are seen in the appropriate states.  Multiple transitions between wakefulness and sleep were noted, but sustained deeper stages of sleep were not identified.
Heart rate 66.
IMPRESSION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring did not identify seizures or interictal epileptiform activity.  No events were recorded. Event time:  8:40 AM.  The patient was awake, she had been talking on the phone and had, by report, a conflict with someone.
The patient pushed the button at 8:34, then she laid down.  The nurses entered.  The patient had an episode of tremulousness of the body, lasting about 15 seconds, after which she was unresponsive to the nurses but the EEG demonstrated a normal awake pattern.  There was no background slowing.
Additional push buttons were recorded on the afternoon of February 12, including 3:40 PM.  The patient reported headaches and feeling nervous during these spells.
IMPRESSION:  This 24-hour video EEG monitoring session is remarkable for:
The absence of interictal epileptiform activity.
Recording one of the patient's typical events without EEG change.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings were discussed with the patient who understood that she had a diagnosis of emotionally linked, not electrical, epilepsy.  EEG monitoring was discontinued after that discussion.
