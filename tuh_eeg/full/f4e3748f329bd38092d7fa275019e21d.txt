CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman, found on October 16th with hyperglycemia, status post code at 15:24 p.m. for 16 minutes, HHNK.  Obstructive hydrocephalus with increased ICP effacement of the cisterns and tonsillar herniation.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, famotidine, and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient was intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  EEG pattern demonstrates a continuous, mixed frequency pattern with mixtures of theta and delta.  Shifting asymmetries were noted and there is a bit more posteriorly predominant delta.  Tactile stimulation of the patient did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Significant generalized background slowing.
Shifting delta posteriorly predominant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  These findings  of generalized slowing may be correlated with clinical history of marked hydrocephalus.
