CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with hypertension had a seizure disorder in his 20s but was put on Dilantin and was seizure-free for about 8 year, then on January 4 had a seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, ASA, Phenobarbital, Cholesterol medication.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  There is normal frontocentral beta and no sleep is captured.  The patient undergoes hyperventilation and photic stimulation with no abnormal discharge seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Excessive theta in wakefulness at a frequency of 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts.
During the recording there are small fragments of anterior predominant spike and wave which appear to be sometimes maximal over the left hemisphere and sometimes over the right hemisphere and on video appears to have an accompanying muscle jerk.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Fragmented general spike and wave with associated muscle jerk consistent with myoclonus.
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The fragmentary general spikes and waves may be representative of an atypical focal pattern due to the asymmetry seen on the EEG, or may be part of a fragment of a generalized spike and wave consistent with generalized epilepsy.  The fact that they have a muscle jerk is consistent with myoclonus and suggests the latter type of epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
