REASON FOR STUDY:  Preop for aortic arch replacement.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 80-year-old man with a history of triple bypass surgery in 1999, colon cancer status post surgery in 2012, hypertension, angina, and here for preop aortic arch replacement surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Protonix, Zocor, Cartia, Ecotrin, and lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
Heart rate 78 and irregular at times with PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
