CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed woman admitted on the 8th with status epilepticus and abnormal LFTs.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Cymbalta, Coreg, Ativan, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal and includes a very slow chaotic pattern with delta. High amplitude sharp waves are noted in the right occipital region with a generous field of spread. Some of these have a spread to C4 and at times there is C4 sharp waves which are independent of the right parietal occipital sharp waves. Although there are no definitive clinical seizures noted, there is some build up noted on 2 occasions with faster frequency activity emanating from the right occipital region. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous sharp waves noted from the right occipital region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG shows clinical seizures characterized by buildup of epileptiform, activity from the right, but with little in the way of clinical correlate.
