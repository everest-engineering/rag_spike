LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a past medical history of motor vehicle accident.  She now presents with chief complaint of headaches and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Flexeril, and Fioricet.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated lower amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is observed.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 22-minute electroencephalogram.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
