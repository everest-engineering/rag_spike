History:	76 YR OLD MALE R HANDED. CC OF NEAR SYNCOPE EVENT 58 CM HEAD PMHX STROKE ALCOHOL ABUSE, BP GERD, GI BLEED, GERD, HTN.
Medications:	Coumadin, Lasix, Lovenox.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
HR was 102
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild diffuse
Interpretation: This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The focal slowing can be a normal finding for age.
