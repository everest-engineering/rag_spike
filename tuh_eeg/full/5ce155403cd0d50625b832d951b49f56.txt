CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old gentleman with epilepsy, seizure free for the last 10 years but with inappropriate behavior, lower extremity weakness, and then a seizure in the Emergency Room waiting area.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lasix, Lisinopril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed for this very drowsy individual.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is asleep through almost the entire EEG. He awakens really only for photic stimulation at which point an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm is identified. The remainder of the drowsy record is a low voltage, slow pattern. In drowsiness, there is some occipital delta identified bilaterally but with a bit of shifting slowing in the occipital regions.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features. The excessive drowsiness may be correlated clinically.
