CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, rare early
morning or nocturnal tonic clonic seizures typically in the context of sleep deprivation.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG
demonstrates a well developed symmetric reactive 9 hertz alpha rhythm reaching 80
microvolts. Occasional, frontally predominant bursts of high amplitude, 3-5 hertz spike
and slow wave activity are identified in wakefulness. They are accentuated in early
drowsiness and by hyperventilation. Bursts are typically frontally predominant and
symmetrical although there are a handful that demonstrate shifting symmetry and rare
bursts that are occipitally predominant. Photic stimulation elicits driving, but does not
seem to accentuate the spike in wave activity.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3-5 hertz spike in wave activity.
2. Occasional spike in wave discharge which may be a little bit more asymmetric or
posteriorly predominant
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings have been identified in this patient's
previous EEGs. They are most supportive of a primary generalized mechanism for
epilepsy, but could be seen in a secondary generalized mechanism.
