History:	42 YR OLD MAN ADMITTED AFTER RECENT SZ WITNESSED AT HOME,
COMPLICATED HOSPITALIZATION, NOT WAKING UP. 16 MIN CARDIAC ARREST
OVER THE WEEKEND. HAS PRIOR EEGS.
Medications:	Phenobarbital
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 138.  There are frequent
intermittent eye movement and ventilator/breathing artifacts noted.  No reactivity to tactile stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation diffuse
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and
attenuation with an absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate to severe  diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  In the setting of anoxic brain injury and the
absence of sedating medications, the above findings may support a poor prognosis for full
