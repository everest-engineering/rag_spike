CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed woman admitted on the 8th with prolonged postictal state. Seizure free for 7 years until 3 seizures on the 6th.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is somewhat agitated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates excess 6 hertz theta, generous beta and significant muscle artifact. There is some shifting asymmetry with a bit more rhythmic delta seen intermittently in the left or right occipital region. As the recording continues, there is a glimpse of an 8 hertz alpha rhythm. There are occasional bursts of sharply contoured slowing at C3-T3. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. Following photic stimulation, the patient starts to become a bit drowsy with an increase in beta. Shifting asymmetries are noted with beta. In addition, as the patient starts to be become drowsy during the 21 hertz stimulation, there is an asymmetry with a bit more beta produced on the right and a single right parietal sharp wave.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Beta asymmetry and a photic driving asymmetry with decreased faster frequency noted on left.
3. Left central temporal sharply contoured delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function (the excess theta). Because of the degree of movement artifact, epileptiform activity may have been under recognized. When the patient is more cooperative, a follow-up study may be of use.
