Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background was characterized by a 25-40uV, 7Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Some state changes were seen.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity and lost of faster frequencies was seen over the left
hemisphere, maximally in the midtemporal region.  Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present
right central region with an associated increase in faster frequencies, consistent with a break
rhythm..  No epileptiform discharges were present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, bilateral
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, left hemispheric, with loss of faster frequencies
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, right central, with associated faster frequencies
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing which is an etiologically
nonspecific indicator of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In addition, there was  continuous
focal slowing in the left hemisphere, maximal in the temporal lobe which is consistent with the
known stroke. Lastly, there was  continuous focal slowing in the right central region which is
consistent with a focal structural lesion in this region.
