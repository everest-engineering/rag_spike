History:	46 year old woman status post severe SAH, now with plan to start pentobarbital drip
to control high ICPs.
Medications:	Propofol, versed, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~15 hours from 4/23/2015 till 4/24/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording the background consists of low amplitude
diffuse beta activity and moderate amplitude scant theta activity admixed with periods of
discontinuity.  As the recording progresses, frank burst-suppression is captured  with periods of
suppression increasing as the recording progresses.  No normal sleep architecture or reactivity are
Summary of Findings:
Burst-suppression pattern
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked
No reactivity
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous ~15-hour video EEG due to marked background slowing that
increases to burst-suppression pattern as the recording progresses. These findings indicate severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and, in the absence of escalation in general anesthetics doses, indicate
worsening cerebral dysfunction.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
