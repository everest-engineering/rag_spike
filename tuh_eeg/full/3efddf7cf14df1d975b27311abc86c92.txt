CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old woman transferred from Episcopal Hospital after seizures characterized by a blank stare then generalized shaking.  Complex medical history including alcohol abuse, DVT, IVC filter, antithrombin III deficiency, history of bilateral white matter and temporal lobe changes after previous prolonged seizures, and laryngeal pathology.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Ativan, phenytoin, phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was  performed in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the initial recording, after the patient has received these medications, there is an asymmetry.  There is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm with left hemisphere theta.
As the recording continues, the patient remains more awake.  There is an alpha rhythm which starts to emerge from the right before the left.  The alpha rhythm reaches 9 Hz.  Asymmetry persists with a more rhythmic theta noted on the left in comparison to the right.
A pushbutton event was noted at 7:14 p.m.   No seizures noted.
By 12:30 in the morning, well defined stage 2 sleep was identified.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This long-term video EEG monitoring was remarkable for:
An initially slow background.
Gradual improvement overall of the background, but with left hemispheric rhythmic slowing.
By the close of the record, intermittent left rhythmic slowing but overall improvement.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  There were 2 pushbuttons noted.  The patient was with someone at the bedside and there was clinical evidence of a seizure or other seizure-like behavior.
