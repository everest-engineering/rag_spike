CLINICAL HISTORY:  41 year old woman with history of gastroparesis, constipation, and unreadable low blood sugar, now with a seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lovenox, Famotidine, Zofran, Tylenol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, lethargy, and sleep.  No activating procedures per performed, but the patient was stimulated during the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background, which at best reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive.  At times with stimulation there appears to be a nice FIRDA or frontal intermittent rhythmic delta pattern that arises and disappears.  There is some normal sleep architecture seen at times.  At times there is also some bilateral frontal sharp transients, but not clearly epileptiform.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves.
FIRDA.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medications, a toxic metabolic encephalopathy, or bilateral white matter disease.  No seizure or epileptiform activity were clearly seen. The EEG is reactive which suggests a favorable prognosis.
