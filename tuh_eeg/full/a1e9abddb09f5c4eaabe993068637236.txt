TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

This posterior dominant rhythm has a low amplitude of about 20-30 microvolts.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharge.  However, photic stimulation does produce nice photic driving.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2.
