DATE OF STUDY:  12/09/2012 to 12/10/2012.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman with history of a right PCOM aneurysm which bled, was coiled and later on had to be clipped with recurrent episodes of staring and right sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, zonisamide and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed for 24 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal lead and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continue spike detection software as well as seizure detection software along with patient's notes, nurse's notes and patient's alarms were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Patient has no  activating procedures performed.  Patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously at F8/T4 and independently at T4 at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times there is slightly sharply contoured pattern to this and there appears to be a slight increased amplitude at times here consistent with a breached rhythm.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to right anterior temporal and mid temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the right anterior temporal and mid temporal regions, which is consistent with the known hemorrhage and surgery.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
