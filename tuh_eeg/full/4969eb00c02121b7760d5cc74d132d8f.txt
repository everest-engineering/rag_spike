RESPOND. WAXING AND WANING MENTAL STATUS, R/O SUBCLINICAL SZ.
Medications:	SINEMET, METOPROLOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
In maximal wakefulness there is a low amplitude, 7-8Hz alpha rhythm, which is poorly reactive to
eye opening.  Waking background consists of irregular 4-7Hz theta activity seen over the left
hemisphere. At times there are seconds of central beta seen over the left hemisphere.  As
drowsiness progresses, vertex waves appear.
Background activity shows lower amplitude and attenuation over the right hemisphere.  Continuous
polymorphic delta activity is present over the right hemisphere maximal in the anterior temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  One sharply contoured discharge is
present in the left anterior temporal region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 102 and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right hemispheric, maximal anterior temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing and
attenuation in the right hemisphere.  This finding is indicative of severe focal structural cerebral
dysfunction in this region, which is consistent with the known stroke. There is also  diffuse
background slowing. These findings are indicative of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  The single sharply contoured waveform is of unclear
