CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old female with left MCA stroke, right-sided hemiparesis, confusion, disoriented with a history of hypertension and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Zocor, Simvastatin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion, change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is best seen over the right hemisphere and not clearly seen and markedly slowed over the left hemisphere.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta best seen over the right hemisphere.  No activating procedures were performed.  Sleep architecture is seen, stage 1 and stage 2 with more spindles seen over the right hemisphere.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at T3.
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Loss of normal posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Left midtemporal sharp waves and left hemispheric slowing, maximal at T3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximum in the mid-temporal.  In addition, there is a focus of acute irritability in that region which has a high correlation with seizures arising from that area.  No seizures were seen.
