CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 45-year-old male with catatonia, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, and agitation.  Nonverbal for the past 3 years.  The patient recently treated on the inpatient neurology service.
MEDICATIONS:  Valium. Geodon, Sinequan
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta and a small amount of theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with brief attenuation of the alpha rhythm, but deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited symmetric bilateral driving.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of rhythmic slowing.

Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  WNL  EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. The mild excess theta may be due to medicines. The prior 4 EEGs were not available for comparison
