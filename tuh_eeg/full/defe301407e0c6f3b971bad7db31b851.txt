Medications: Versed, Zosyn, Hydralazine
Sedation:
EEG Type: Asleep only
Technique: International 1 0Â·20 System; standard 21 electrodes, comatose
Description:
Severe attenuation and slowing or the background activity with no spontaneous variability or stimulation reactivity. No posterior dominant rhythm is present.
No epileptiform discharges are present
There is no change in the background activity to noxious stimuli. HR is 90 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation
No reactivity
Voltage attenuation, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal EEG due to diffuse and severe attenuation and slowing of background activity. In the setting of anoxic brain injury, this pattern i s associated w"h poor cerebral functional prognosis.
Clinical correlation Is recommended. Repeat EEG when the patient is off sedatives may be helpful.
