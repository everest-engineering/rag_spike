History:	69 YO MALE WITH STAGE 4 NSCLCA WITH BRAIN METS S/P RADIATION. PMH:
DEMENTIA, EPILEPSY, GOUT, ACUTE STROKE.

AFTER STARTING EEG TEAM SAID PT WILL BE GOING HOME ON HOSPICE.
Medications:	RISPERDAL, OXCARBAZEPINE, DEXAMETHASONE, ZOSYN, METHADONE,
COREG, FAMOTIDINE, ASA, UNASYN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was is reactivity to auditory and
tactile stimuli.  Hr was 96bps and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate to severe diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
