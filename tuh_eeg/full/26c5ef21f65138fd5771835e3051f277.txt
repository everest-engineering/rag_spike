History:	67 year old man who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
At best, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz.  AP gradient is poor.  The majority of the
recording consists of a mixture of diffuse excess beta activity with slow low amplitude underriding
delta activity.  Patient moves throughout the recording.  Patient remains awake throughout the
No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Occasional abnormal QS complexes
are captured.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Artifact, movement
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute portable EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
