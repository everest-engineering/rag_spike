History:	72 YEAR OLD FEMALE PRESENTING WITH NEW ONSET OF SEIZURE. PMH:
CVA, DM, HTN
Medications:	RANITIDINE, LISINOPRIL, LIPITOR, SYNTHROID, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm, better seen
over the left hemisphere.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage theta
activity with some anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp
waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.  These waveforms
demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto -temporal region.  Intermittent
polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal region.  No epileptiform discharges
are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR 96
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, right frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  continuous focal slowing in the right  fronto -temporal
region. This  findings is indicative of a focal structural lesion in that region. In addition, there is
intermittent focal slowing in the left fronto -temporal region, which is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction in that region and it is non-specific with regards to etiology.  Finally, there is diffuse
background slowing and triphasic waves, which is indicative diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.
