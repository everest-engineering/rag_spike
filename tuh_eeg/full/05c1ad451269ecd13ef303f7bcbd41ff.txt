REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old lady who presented with acute respiratory distress.  The patient remained unresponsive, even after discontinuation of the fentanyl, for which an EEG was obtained.
MEDICATIONS:  Cefepime.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1-channel EKG.  Sleep and wakefulness were captured.  Activation procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a diffusely slow background in the delta range with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 30 to 50 microvolts.  There is excess beta in the frontal leads.
The EEG is reactive to stimuli. There are clear state changes with some normal sleep elements which included occasional spindles.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Diffuse slowing with 2 to 4 Hz frequency and 30 to 50 microvolts amplitude.
Frontally predominant triphasic waves seen frequently.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse delta range slowing.
Frontally predominant triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non specific with regards to etiology. However, the presence of triphasic waves suggests that this may be due at least in part to metabolic dysfunction causing diffuse encephalopathy.  The presence of excess beta indicates that there might also be a component of medication-induced encephalopathy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
