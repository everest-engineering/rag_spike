REASON FOR STUDY:  Altered mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 66-year-old woman with change of mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, folic acid, thiamine, Theragran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG is performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel with anterior temporal and single lead electrocardiogram electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some muscle artifact seen on the bifrontal region frequently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a poorly defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz that is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal Discharges:
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal more than right midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal more than the right midtemporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are seen.
