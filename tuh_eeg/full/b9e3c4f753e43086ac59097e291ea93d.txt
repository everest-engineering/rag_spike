History:	58 YR MALE WITH CC OF 2 SZS IN ER HAD 2 MORE. GTC.  PMHX; ESRD (MWF),
HTN, SPINAL STENOSIS, HYPOTHYROIDISM, HCV
Medications:	HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm reaches at best 8Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
disorganized theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, intermixed frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur
throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness consistent with frontal
intermittent delta activity (FIRDA).  Some sharply contoured discharges seen but none clearly
epileptic.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Disorganization, persistent
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent frontal
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of diffuse background slowing, FIRDA and slow alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
