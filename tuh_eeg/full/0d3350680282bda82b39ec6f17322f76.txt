CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old gentleman with a remote history of epilepsy, occasional closed head traumas, severe cervical DJD with a slip and fall event with an acute spinal cord syndrome with weakness of the arms and clonus in the lower extremities.

MEDICATIONS: Valium, Morphine, Methadone, Percocet, Solu Medrol, Neurontin, Famotidine, Elavil

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is wearing a hard collar and is uncomfortable.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a central mu rhythm is seen. There is intermittent theta observed in the background and a suggestion of some spitting slowing on the left.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Some occasional shifting, slowing with the suggestion of some left temporal focal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The focal features are of unclear significance in that it is a somewhat complicated bedside recording. Correlation with imaging may be appropriate given the history of closed head injury.
