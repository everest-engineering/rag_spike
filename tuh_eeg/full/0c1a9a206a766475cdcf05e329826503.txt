DATE OF STUDY:  03/04/2013 through 03/05/2013.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy following right MCA infarct due to cardiac pathology as a youngster.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Tegretol, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient recalled an episode of left body tremulousness around midnight, but his attempt to push the button was unsuccessful.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively symmetric with a discernable alpha rhythm seen bilaterally and new rhythm seen on the left.
As the patient becomes drowsy the asymmetry becomes more remarkable with more suppression of faster frequency activity on the right.  There are some sections with sharp waves noted from the right, but there are also bursts of sharply contoured slowing and sharp waves noted from the left.
Seizures:  Although it is impossible to see the clinical event with shaking on the left in the video, there is a suggestion of rhythmic theta noted from the left T1 region around the time of the patient's description of the clinical event.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
