History:	61YO  FEMALE S/P LEFT SAH, H/O ANEURYSM REPAIR, WITH CRANIOPLASTY.
PT HERE FOR CHECK UP.
Medications:
Sedation:	Lorazepam
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present at T3 during wakefulness, increasing during
drowsiness.  There is an associated breach rhythm in this region.  Occasional focal sharp waves are
present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at T3.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mid, Associated breach
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent epileptiform discharges in
the left midtemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region,  and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of
localization-related epilepsy. In addition there is  continuous focal slowing in the left midtemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region and consistent with the
