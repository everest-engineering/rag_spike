CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old male with mesial temporal sclerosis, now with increasing confusion, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, multiple seizure related injuries.
MEDICATIONS: CBZ and Phenobarb
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a somewhat slow alpha rhythm of 6.5 Hz.  The alpha rhythm increases to 7.5 Hz.  In wakefulness, there are independent, right or left, temporal sharp waves noted.
Hyperventilation produces both increase in background slowing and it also seemed to accentuate the independent right or left temporal sharp waves.  Fast activity is noted with some of the right anterior temporal sharp waves just after hyperventilation.  Hyperventilation is followed by drowsiness.  As the patient transitions towards drowsiness, there is a section of the record with an increase in organization and then background slowing and some disorganization.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Independent right or left temporal sharp waves.
Slowing of the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The background slowing was noted in 2009.  It has not significantly changed.  Overall, this EEG suggests a temporal lobe localization for this
patient's epilepsy, but this may involve both temporal lobes.  The background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
