REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 79-year-old man with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage and seizures with a past medical history of seizures secondary to alcohol withdrawal.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Cardizem, Lovenox, Digoxin, and Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The records opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches at best 8.5 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen recurrently at T3 and independently at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Excess theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent bilateral mid temporal focal slowing as well as mild episodes during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal regions as well as mild generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
