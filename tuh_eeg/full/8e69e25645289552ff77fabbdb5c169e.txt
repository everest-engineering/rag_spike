History:	66 year old woman who presents with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Ativan x1 dose
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of slow attenuated delta activity and
continues triphasics waveforms.  With stimulation, the background briefly changes and fast delta
activity appears.  No normal sleep architecture is present.  Patient is not allowed to rest during the
study due to examinations by various providers.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, severe
Triphasic waves, continuous
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 24 minute EEG due to severe diffuse slowing and continuous
triphasic waveforms. These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Triphasic waves are a nonspecific
EEG finding that can be seen in encephalopathy (hepatic most frequently), uremia, anoxia and
other etiologies.  There is clear background reactivity.  No electrographic seizures are present.
