History:	68 YO FEMALE PRESENTS W / EMS, NAUSEA, VOMITING, DIARRHEA AND
AMS.  ON 5/1 PT E/V/D  W/ AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS.
PMHX: SZ DISORDER, PRES, HTN, DM2
Medications:	CEFTRIAXONE, VANCOMYCIN, MIDAZOLAM, LORAZEPAM, AMPICILLIN IN ED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left more than right frontotemporal regions
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, marked, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral frontotemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
