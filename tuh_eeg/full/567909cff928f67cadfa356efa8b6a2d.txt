History: Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
58 year old woman with a single prolonged amnestic episode. Keppra
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T11T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm,which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mild-to-moderate No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG due to intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
