CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old female with new-onset seizures July 2009, history of
developmental delay, bipolar disease, and seizures in infancy.

MEDICATIONS: Cymbalta, Albuterol, Midodrine, Ativan

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 10.5 Hz 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of excess beta and a small amount.
of excess theta for an adult of this age. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in beta.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess beta .
2. Mild excess theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in a
diffuse disturbance of cerebral function which may include this patient's medications.
No epileptiform features were noted.
