CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 67-year-old right-handed man with history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, status post chemo, who presents with episode of confusion over the last several days.  He seems drowsy and at times obtunded.
MEDICATIONS:  Lactulose, spironolactone, and Lasix.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. This tracing captures the patient in a confused and obtunded state.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the confused, obtunded state, there is diffuse slowing of the background consisting of 5-6 Hz theta frequency activity intermixed with 2-3 Hz delta activity.  He had 10-20 microvolts in amplitude.  There were also triphasic waves seen occasionally with a frequency of 1 to 1.5 Hz, occasionally posteriorly predominant.  There is spontaneous variability seen with increased in background frequency intermittently.  There is also reactivity seen in the form of increased background frequency on stimulating.  The patient no seizures or epileptiform activity was captured.  Heart rate was 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording capturing the patient in a lethargic state due to;
Diffuse slowing of the background.
The presence of triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Diffuse slowing and triphasic waves are suggestive of either metabolic toxic, anoxic or infectious encephalopathy.  Alternatively, it could be due to the effect of medications or bilateral cerebral dysfunction.  The triphasic waves could also be due to the patient's underlying liver disease.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  If clinically indicated, a continuous bedside EEG monitoring may be helpful.
