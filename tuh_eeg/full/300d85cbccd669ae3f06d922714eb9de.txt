CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old male with fever and seizures and no other past medical history.

MEDICATIONS: Versed,  Ativan, Phosphenytoin


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Patient is intubated and is being evaluated for status epilepticus.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This acute emergency room record demonstrates a markedly abnormal but dynamic pattern. As the tracing begins, the overall background is slow, even slightly discontinuous. There is an area in the right hemisphere of irregular epileptiform activity with sharp waves or spikes maximum at T6 P4 02 but with variability. There is even a spike that starts posteriorly and then demonstrates spread to T4 T6. Some of the discharges are followed by right frontally predominant rhythmic delta. As the recording continues, there is less
in the background suppression following the spikes,  the epileptiform activity is present but does
not build up into bursts and the overall background is more continuous. In addition, at the end of the record, it is returned mixed frequency activity.

HR:	N/A


IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.	A complex, polyphasic epileptiform discharge in the right posterior quadrant with variable maximum.
2. 	Right frontotemporal delta.
3. 	Background slowing.
4. 	Intermittently discontinuous record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports an irritative process. In addition, there is focal slowing and bilateral background slowing. Correlation with clinical history is recommended.
