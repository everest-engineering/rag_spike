CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old left handed man with history of seizures, presents with possible status epilepticus with past medical history of stroke, hepatitis C cirrhosis, traumatic brain injury, now with EEG for myoclonus versus seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Albuterol, Ipratropium, Dopamine, Ceftriaxone, Pantoprazole, Versed, Fentanyl.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures, now with myoclonic jerks.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with addition of an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.   The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta.  The patient did not appear to go into normal sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with low-amplitude 20-30 mV seen continuously.
Throughout the recording, there is low-amplitude sharply contoured periodic discharges seen maximally at CZ occurring about 1 Hz with no clear clinical correlate, most consistent with CZ sharp waves and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.
SEIZURES:  None.
Of note, during the recording, the technician did stimulate the patient, and the patient appeared to be eye fluttering and moving rhythmically, but there is no EEG correlate to this eye movement seen or fluttering of the eyes.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Central PLEDs.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction and irritability in the central region which may be due to an underlying lesion or focus of irritation.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to utility.  No seizures were clearly seen.
