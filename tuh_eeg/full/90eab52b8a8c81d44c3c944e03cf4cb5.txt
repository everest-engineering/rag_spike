CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old male with episodes of Deja Vu and loss of
awareness lasting 2-3 minutes. The last event was 2 weeks ago. Events occur 2-4
times per year.
MEDICATIONS: Zonegram and a sleeping medication.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized
by slow rolling eye movements. This record demonstrates rare, isolated theta in the left
mid to posterior temporal region. This is seen in relaxed wakefulness. Photic
stimulation elicits vigorous driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very minimally abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rare, subtle focal theta in the left posterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No sharp waves or spikes were observed. If needed, a
follow up study capturing the first stages of sleep may be helpful to search for
epileptiform activity.
