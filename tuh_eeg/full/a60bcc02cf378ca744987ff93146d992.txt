CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 48-year-old man with a past history of drug abuse and head trauma in the 1980s who presents with refractory epilepsy here for differential and classification.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient was placed back on Depakote, Topamax and Lamictal 25 mg every other day without it.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike wave detection as well as seizure detection software in addition to nurses notes and patient's push button events were used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is low voltage to this posterior dominant pattern.  The patient has normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage 1, stage 2 and deeper stages of sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Frequent sharp waves seen only during wakefulness and sleep frequently at T2/F8, more than T1/F7.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at T2/F8 and occasional at T3/F7.
Frequency of 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES OR PUSH BUTTONS:  None during this recording.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves (right more than left) as well as focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from either anterior temporal lobe.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions which is nonspecific with regards to the etiology.  No seizures were seen during the last day 3 of recording.
