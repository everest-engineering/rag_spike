History:	63 year old woman with SAH.  There is a concern for seizures since patient's
aphasia has gradually worsened.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, lethargic
Description:
There is right-to-left intrahemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left.  The
background over the right hemisphere consists of polymorphic 8 Hz maximally posterior theta
activity with excess theta and delta activity and poor AP gradient.  The background over the left
hemisphere consists of polymorphic very unstable 7 Hz maximally posterior theta activity,
polymorphic theta and delta activity and no clear AP gradient.  Sleep is characterized by diffuse
attenuation of the background and increase in diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity.
An episode of staring and gaze deviation to the left is annotated by the EEG technologist at the
end of the recording.  There is no abnormal ictal correlate with those findings.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Other, episode of gaze deviation to L and staring: no EEG correlate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, left hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute portable EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse
slowing and continuous moderate left hemispheric focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of
mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal
slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.  An episode of staring and gaze
deviation to the left had no abnormal ictal correlate.  Only ~ 25% of simple partial seizures are
captured on a scalp EEG recording.
