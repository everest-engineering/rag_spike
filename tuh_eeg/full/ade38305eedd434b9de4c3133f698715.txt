None
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic




Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.

intermittent focal delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness and HV. No epileptiform discharges are present.

Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal slowing in the left midtemporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, mid

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left midtemporal region. This finding is indicative of to	cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific.
