History:	53 year old woman who is in coma.  Patient had episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	no sedation, no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for ~16.5 hours from 11/3/2015 till 11/4/2015.
Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior. Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists primarily of low amplitude monomorphic
diffuse alpha activity with occasional brief bursts of diffuse polymorphic theta or delta activity seen.
No normal sleep architecture is present.
No electrographic seizures are captured.
There is no clear change in the background activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Coma, alpha coma
No reactivity
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL continuous video ~16.5 hour EEG due to primarily alpha coma pattern and
lack of clear background reactivity. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No electrographic seizures are present.  These findings were conveyed
to the neurology consult team.
