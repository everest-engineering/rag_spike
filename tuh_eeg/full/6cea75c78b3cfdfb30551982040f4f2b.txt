History:	28 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF WAKING UP YESTERDAY CONFUSED/TIRED
DREAMT HAD SZ COULDNT FOLLOW COMMANDS X 3HRS,  DROVE SELF TO
WORK LATE BUT DID NOT REMEMBER.  THEN FELT FUZZY IN MD OFFICE
THEN STARED.  PATERNAL GRANDFATHER AND AND AUNT WITH SZS.
Medications:	PROTONIX
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Nearly continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal region (left
more right) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of nearly continuous focal slowing
in the bilateral anterior temporal region (left more right) region.  This finding is indicative of severe
focal cerebral dysfunction in this regions, likely structural in origin.
