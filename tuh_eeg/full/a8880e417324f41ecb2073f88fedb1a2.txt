INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness today, background EEG was slightly slow with an alpha rhythm just below 8.5 Hz and a small amount of 7 Hz activity. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.

HR: 60 bpm, occasional PVCs.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild slowing of the background.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. This patient's medical comorbidities may contribute to the background slowing described above.
