History:	45 year old who was admitted with subacute change in mental status and at least 1
witnessed seizure.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, obtunded
Description:
There is right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower waveforms over the left hemisphere.
The background over the right hemisphere consists of low amplitude 9-10 Hz activity posteriorly,
poor AP gradient and excess polymorphic theta and delta activity.  The background over the left
hemisphere lacks PDR or AP gradient.  The background over the left consists of a mixture of
frequencies ( sharply contoured polymorphic alpha, theta and delta activity).  Additionally, left
temporal leads demonstrate continuous rhythmic moderate-to-high amplitude rhythmic theta and
delta activity with underriding low-to-moderate amplitude fast activity, most pronounced over the
T5 lead.  Throughout the recording this  activity varies in frequency.  During periods of quiescence,
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 23-minute portable EEG due to focal left temporal status epilepticus. The
primary team was informed of the finding.
