HISTORY: 25 year old right handed male with brain tumor resected
. The patient reports ongoing headaches.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Singulair.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is noted to have a left
frontal craniotomy.
DESCRIPTION-OF T-HE-RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a 10Hz, 50 microvolt alpha rhythm. The alpha rhythm is symmetric and
reactive. There is a subtle breech rhythm characterized by accentuation of 3-5 Hz
activity in the left frontal region. Hyperventilation produces a small accentuation of that
breech rhythm and the focal3-5 Hz activity. Features of drowsiness include brief
attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does not active the record.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
I. A breech rhythm in the left frontal region.
2. Very subtle focal slowing.
3. No epileptiform features were noted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are anticipated findings
following craniotomy.
