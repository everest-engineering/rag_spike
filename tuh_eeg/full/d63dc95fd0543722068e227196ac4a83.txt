CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old woman with multiple myeloma, presented to the emergency room yesterday complaining of knee pain, received Motrin and returned later with 2 tonic clonic seizures and prolonged postictal obtundation PRES embolic infarcts.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Oxycodone, Prilosec, Norvasc
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is very uncomfortable and hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is disorganized. There is a suggestion of a 7 hertz alpha rhythm with some theta frequency activity, shifting slowing, generous beta activity and on rare occasions, the alpha rhythm does seem to reach 9 hertz. General muscle artifact is noted. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. As she becomes a bit drowsy, there is some shifting asymmetry in the posterior regions. Vertex waves and spindles are noted in sleep, but sleep is not sustained.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting posterior slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. It is compatible with PRES WITH shifting slowing in the posterior region.
