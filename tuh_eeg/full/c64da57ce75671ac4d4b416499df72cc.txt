INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The EEG was recorded during wakefulness and stage I/stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I/stage II.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
