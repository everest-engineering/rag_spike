History:	50 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  SYNCOPE SPELLS, COGNITIVE
DECLINE AND WEAKNESS OF LEFT HAND.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was present and at best reached 9 HZ  Background activity was
characterized by diffuse delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior
gradient of frequencies.  No normal beta was seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 78Bps
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing.  This finding is
indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
