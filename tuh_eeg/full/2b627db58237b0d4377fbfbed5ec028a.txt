CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old woman with episodes of right-sided shaking with secondary bilateral shaking lasting 4-5 minutes, 1-minute confusion after the death of her daughter.

MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Restoril, Desyrel, Klonopin, Relpax, Toprol, Abilify, Xanax.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and generous beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by increase in beta with POSTS, vertex waves, and then rare spindles in stage 2 sleep.

The patient was in stage 2 sleep during photic stimulation which still elicited a driving response.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.  Heart rate 50 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta identified above may be due to this patient's medications.  The patient was asleep during photic stimulation which may represent a relative sleep deficit.  Evaluation of her bradycardia may be appropriate.
