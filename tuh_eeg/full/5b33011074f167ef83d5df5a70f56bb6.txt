AGE: 42 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 10/16/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: Inpatient Rm 876
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, Awake and asleep EEG #: 15- 1530
HISTORY:
a 42 y.o. female with a history of syncope and seizures referred for routine EEG for seizure evaluation. "syncope without arrhythmia"
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
DME Unspecified Misc, As directed, Left thumb cool comfort brace, X-Large
No current facility-administered seizure medications
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG, HV and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. There is generous beta noted.
PSWY were seen
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: produces an increase in amplitude Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding, despite the fact that the patient was falling asleep.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal Drowsy and asleep routine EEG.	The are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal Awake and asleep routine EEG for a very drowsy patient with generous beta.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
