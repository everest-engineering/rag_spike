CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55 -year-old male who presented today in cardiogenic shock, status post code on April 3rd for 30 minutes, now with hypothermic treatment.
MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Lidocaine, amiodarone, Fentanyl, epinephrine and Neo-Synephrine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.   The patient's body temperature was 33.1 degrees.  The patient was shivering.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This EEG demonstrates diffuse shiver artifact.  With the use of a 15 Hz filter, there is some alpha frequency activity as well as some beta frequency activity noted.  This shiver is remarkable enough to obscure the EKG.
Tactile stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging but abnormal EEG due to:
Paucity of the normal wave forms.
Likely a pattern with generous beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The use of a neuromuscular blocking agent would be necessary to more completely evaluate the cerebral activity given the shiver artifact described.  Versed and Fentanyl may also play a role in the pattern described above.  This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function but is very limited.  Medications may also play a role in the pattern described above and an additional EEG recording is suggested.
