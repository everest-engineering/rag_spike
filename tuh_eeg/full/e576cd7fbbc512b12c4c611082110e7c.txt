History:	52 year old man who had focal status epilepticus in 1/2015.  This is a follow-up
Medications:	Vimpat, Insulin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a very low voltage diffuse fast activity.  During brief
drowsiness, bursts of diffuse theta activity are captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Low voltage, severe
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 1-hour EEG, awake and briefly drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information. Low voltages are found in ~ 10% of the general population.
