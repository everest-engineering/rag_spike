History:	73 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH H/O SZS CPS LAST SZ SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.
FOLLOW UP EEG. PT DENIES ANY RECENT SZ ACTIVITY
Medications:	Phenytoin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates,
and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Frequent polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior temporal (left much more than right)
region during wakefulness.  There is one 3 second burst of focal slowing on the left that appears
slightly monomorphic.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR was 72.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, marked, bilateral (L>R) temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
anterior temporal (left much more than right) region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin. In addition,  there is
mild diffuse background slowing.  These finding is an etiologically non-specific indicator of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
