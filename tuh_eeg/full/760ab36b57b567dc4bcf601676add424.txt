History:	26 YEAR OLD MALE PRESENTING WITH SEIZURES FOLLOWING A TBI ON
4/14/2012. SEIZURES HAVE SUDDEN ONSET, LOC AND FALLING. PT WEARS
A HELMET. LAST SZ WAS ON 5/30/2014.
Medications:	Dilantin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the F4>F3 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  There is an increased amplitude and beta in this regions  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  Hr is 84.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral frontal, with an associated breach.
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
bifrontal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region. In addition
there is  mild diffuse background slowing. This is finding is an etiologically nonspecific indicators of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
