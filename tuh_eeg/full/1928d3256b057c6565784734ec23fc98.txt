REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman with history of seizures for 6 years, last generalized tonic clonic seizure 3 years ago, but now with staring spells almost every week.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, sulfasalazine, omeprazole.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.
Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate:  60.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at T5 while in wakefulness and sleep, in addition to independent sharp waves at F8/T4, also seen in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen frequently at T5 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Focal slow waves also seen occasionally over F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal sharp waves over the left posterior temporal region, as well as independently over the right anterior temporal region, in addition to focal slow waves in both of those regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising possibly from the left posterior temporal region and/or the right anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of independent focal cerebral dysfunction in the left posterior temporal region and in the right anterior temporal region, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
