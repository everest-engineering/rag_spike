AGE: 48 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/15/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1811
HISTORY:
48 y.o. Male who with a history of HTN, OSA was found by his wife, unresponsive and gurgling, referred for routine EEG for evaluation of paroxysmal events.
MEDICATIONS: no AEDs SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10-10.5 Hertz
posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and asleep routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
