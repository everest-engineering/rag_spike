CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed woman who had a stroke in 2009, now with headaches.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. On 1 occasion, there is a single sharply contoured burst on the left. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.

HR: 50 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing additional sleep may be useful. A single burst of slowing is not considered pathological.
