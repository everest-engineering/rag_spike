AGE: 41 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/30/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1742
HISTORY:
41 y.o. male with a history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and psychosis referred for routine EEG because he reports having seizures (last episode: 1 month ago) after running out of his psychiatric medicines.
MEDICATIONS: Lorazepam, Restoril, Keppra SEDATION: meds as above
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically suboptimal study due to muscle artifact despite repeated attempts by the technician to have the patient relax.
Tl and T2 electrodes were not working. The study included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11-12 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During- drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing with beta activity are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180
seconds with fair cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 54 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
