CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed woman with traumatic left frontal
contusion, right orbital
fracture, facial fractures, polysubstance abuse, seizure free for
the last 14 years.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Pepcid, Morphine, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation and
hyperventilation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness there is a 10Hz posterior
dominant rhythm. The overall background includes excess beta and theta. There are
occasional bursts of frontal
delta. There is a slight beta accentuation on the right frontal
region. in relaxed wakefulness there are occasional left anterior temporal sharp and
slow wave complexes.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
2. Excess beta.
3. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.
4. Occasional frontal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with this patients acute
CNS pathology as well as her past history of epilepsy.
