CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old woman with multiple seizures August 8 while hiking.  The patient recalls loss of consciousness with eyes rolling up in her head and confusion.  No incontinence.  No family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  none
INTRODUCTION:  Routine digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  The patient has frequent eye facial grimacing.  Both hyperventilation and drowsiness are characterized by increase of amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features are identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
