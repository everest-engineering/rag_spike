Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral midtemporal
region.  Frequent focal sharp waves are present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at
F8/T4 and rarely at F7/T3 .
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 78
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, frequent, right temporal, anterior
Sharp waves, rare, left temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
in the right anterior and midtemporal region, as well as rarely in the left midtemporal region.
These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in these regions, and given the
clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy. In
addition,  there intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral midtemporal region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in
