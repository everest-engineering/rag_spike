History:	59 Y/O FEMALE R HANDED WITH H/O SZ.AND NOW WITH UTI INFECTION.
Medications:	KEPPRA,LEXAPRO NEURONTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, neonatal
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent spikes, repetitive spikes, and polyspike components, mainly in
the left temporal and centro-parietal region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Spikes, frequent diffuse
Spikes, frequent, left temporal, and centro parietal
Polyspikes
Triphasic waves, continuous diffuse, frontal predominant
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the left midtemporal
and centro parietal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in
this region. In addition there is  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is
etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  No clinical or electrographic seizures
