CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old male with gamma knife treatment for meningioma, increasing
seizures with lower limb shaking followed by generalized tonic-clonic activity. Patient' also has a
long history of left foot spasms.

Baclofen, Dilantin, Tramadol, Keppra. Zocor, Lisinopril, Januvia, Flomax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode
placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are portions when the patient is maximally awake
where there is a 5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Other portions of the record include more of
an arrhythmic delta pattern with triphasic waves. There is shifting slowing, particularly In the
right central and right occipital region with sharp waves in the right occipital region.
HR: 90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Arrhythmic delta.
3. Triphasic waves.
4. Focal slowing in the right hemisphere with right central and occipital sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing and the magnitude of the focal slowing is
similar to previous studies. This individual has had 2 prior EEGs for shaking and left leg spasm.
The triphasic waves suggest, and the Increase in background slowing may be due to metabolic
problem or worsening of his primary brain pathology.
