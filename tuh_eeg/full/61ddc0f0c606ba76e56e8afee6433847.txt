History:	22 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O MULTI SZ  THAT LEAD TO DX OF
MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMOR. REMOVAL ON 1/2/2014. PT DENIES ANY SZ
ACTIVITY SINCE SURGERY.
Medications:	TRILEPTAL
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the C4/T4  region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness. At times sharply contoured.  There is an associated breach in the
region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right central, and temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
central and temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region,
which is consistent with the known tumor.
