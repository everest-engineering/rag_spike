CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old female with history of fibromyalgia and 2 seizure types, here for seizure classification.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term EEG was performed for 24 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
2. There is some sharply contoured transients in the left T3 electrode, however, not clearly pathologic.

SEIZURES:  None.

EVENTS:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen in this 24-hour recording, day 2 of admission.
