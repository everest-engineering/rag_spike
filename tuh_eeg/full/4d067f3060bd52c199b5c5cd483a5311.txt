History:	37 YO FEMALE P/W GENERALIZED SZ X3. + LOC, LASTING 5 MINUTES, EO, + TONGUE BITE, POSTICTAL CONFUSION. 1 ST AND LAST SZ WAS IN JUNE 2014.
PMH: HTN, NARCOTIC ABUSE IN THE PAST
Medications:	KEPPRA, GABAPENTIN, SUBOXONE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 7Hz.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
