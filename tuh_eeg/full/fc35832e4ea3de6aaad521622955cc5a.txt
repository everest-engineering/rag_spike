History:	50 year old woman who presents with an episode of shaking followed by weakness
in right arm and leg.
PMH is notable for HTN, TIA, bilateral renal artery stenosis
Medications:	Nifedipine, Metoprolol, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11-12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, left temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 30 minute EEG due to occasional mild left temporal
slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific,
but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule
out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
