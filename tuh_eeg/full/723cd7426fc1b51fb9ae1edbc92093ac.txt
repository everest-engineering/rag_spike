CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old gentleman discharged from the hospital on November 5 and readmitted a day later after he missed seizure medications.  He presented with recurrent facial twitching x3, difficulty swallowing and MRI suggesting ongoing seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra, pyridoxine, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern.  The overall background is diffusely slow, more significantly slow and suppressed on the left.  A periodic complex was noted from the left hemisphere, maximal in the temporal regions and the occipital regions.  It is at times polyphasic with a periodicity of about 1 per second.  On rare occasions there is a little bit of frequency evolution, but no definitive seizures were identified.  Stimulation of the patient is associated with an increase in faster frequency activity.
Heart rate:  72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A left hemispheric periodic complex with some variability, typically maximum left posterior temporal, occipital or even centrotemporal.
Marked attenuation of faster frequency activity and arrhythmic delta activity in the left hemisphere.
Significant slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to a study performed the previous day.  No clinical seizures were recorded.  These EEG supports an ongoing, highly epileptiform pattern.
