CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed woman with history of epilepsy who stopped taking her medication now presents for recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Mirtazapine, Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide, Oxcarbazepine, Naproxen.
REASON FOR EEG:  History of seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep was recorded. Activating procedures with photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz with low amplitude 20-60 microvolts, which is reactive to eye opening. There is normal central beta. Sleep, stage 1 architecture is seen. Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation does not reveal abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen independently at F7/T3 and F8/T4 frequently at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts. Some of the discharges, specifically the ones on the right, have a suspiciously sharp contour but are not clearly epileptiform.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
independent bilateral anterior temporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral anterior temporal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures nor epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note, that more prolonged recording may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
