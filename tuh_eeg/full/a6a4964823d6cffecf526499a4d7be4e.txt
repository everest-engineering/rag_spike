CLINICAL HISTORY:  38 year old right handed woman with syncope, intermittent dizziness, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness 5-7 times per week.
MEDICATIONS: Naprosyn and Elavil.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video-EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well-developed 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude.  Beta activity is noted in stage I sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:	55 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. The bradycardia may be evaluated clinically.
