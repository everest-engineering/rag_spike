DATES OF THE RECORDING:  10/09/2012 at 8:30 a.m. until 10/10/2012 at 8:30 a.m.
LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a long-standing history of epilepsy, now with increased seizure frequency.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, tegretol, and Celexa.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Continuous video/audio EEG recording.  Seizure detector and spike detector software were implemented.  The patient was provided with a pushbutton.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Frequent lambda waves are captured.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, POSTS, K complexes, slow wave sleep, and several epochs of REM sleep were captured.  No clear electrographic seizures were captured, and there were no events.
FINDINGS:
Normal posterior dominant rhythm.
No electrographic seizures.
No events.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal 24-hour continuous video/audio EEG.  No electrographic seizures or events were captured.
