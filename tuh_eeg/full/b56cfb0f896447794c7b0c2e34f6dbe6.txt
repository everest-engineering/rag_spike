CLINICAL HISTORY: A 21-year-old, right handed male With epilepsy, diagnosed 4 years ago with new type of seizure in September 2013. Seizure was characterized by left-sided chest pain, headache, and then loss of consciousness. Past history of liver transplant at age 3.

MEDICATIONS: Rapamune, Lyrica, Lisinopril (the patient says he is not taking his medications).

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake through stage II steep record.

DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, at times, the background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized, but there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm noted. Other sections of the waking record and well organized. Stage I steep includes vertex waves and POSTS, and stage II sleep demonstrates vertex waves. K complexes, and spindles. Hyperventilation produces bursts of synchronous rhythmic slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited driving at lower flash frequencies.

Heart rate 60 bpm.

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to: Intermittent background slowing and disorganization In wakefulness.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific, but may be seen in the context of an underlying encephalopathy. No epileptiform features were identified, but if seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of steep is suggested.
