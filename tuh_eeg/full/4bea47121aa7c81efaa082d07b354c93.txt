AGE : 23 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/08/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT :Outpatient
EEG TYPE: Routine, awake-and-drowsy EEG #: 15-1310
HISTORY:
23 y.o. Male with a history of tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS :
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) 200 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 750 mg tablet, Take 0.5 tablets by mouth 2 times daily. Long term plan is to wean Keppra
methylphenidate	(RITALIN) 20 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily. ONLY FOR SCHOOL
multivitamin (THERAGRAN) per tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) 500 mg tablet, Take 500 mg by mouth daily.
CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCIUM 600 PO), Take 1,000 mg by mouth daily. SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.
Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 11 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements , attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
Note is made of frequent eye-flutter artifact at the beginning of the study.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 48 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal awake-and-drowsy routine EEG.
