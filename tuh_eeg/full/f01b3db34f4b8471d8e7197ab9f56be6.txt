EEG LENGTH:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of recent left MCA distribution ischemic stroke, who is scheduled to undergo left CEA tomorrow on 01/03/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Nystatin, Lovenox, and Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to a standard 10-20 system with a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a significant right-to-left interhemispheric asymmetry with slower wave forms at higher amplitudes over the left hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the right hemisphere reaches 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Additionally, there is an anterior-to-posterior frequency MCA gradient observed over the right hemisphere.  The posterior dominant rhythm over the left hemisphere is very unstable and reaches maximum about 8 Hz and it does not appear to attenuate with eyes opening.  There is no AP gradient over the left hemisphere.  Additionally, there is continuous polymorphic theta and delta observed over the left hemisphere.  Occasionally brief bursts of diffuse frontally predominant rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) is captured.  This activity is higher in amplitude over the left hemisphere.  During drowsiness bursts of theta and delta activity seen over the right hemisphere and frequency of FIRDA increases.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy 23-minute EEG due to continuous moderate left hemispheric slowing.  This finding indicates a focal left hemispheric dysfunction, likely structural in etiology, and in this patient is consistent with a history of recent left MCA territory infarct.
