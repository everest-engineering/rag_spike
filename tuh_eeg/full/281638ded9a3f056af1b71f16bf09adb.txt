History:	86 year old woman who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	No AEDs.
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, asleep,
lethargic
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate
amplitude theta and delta activity without expected AP gradient.  During sleep, faint very low
amplitude sleep-spindle-like complexes are seen.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart
rate up to 120 bpm during stimulation.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep portable 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate up to 120 bpm during stimulation.
