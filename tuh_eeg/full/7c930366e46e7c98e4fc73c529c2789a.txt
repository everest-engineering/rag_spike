History:	52 year old man with a history of brain tumor and seizures.
Medications:	Dilantin, Zofran, Protonix, Ambien
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
Additional polymorphic theta activity is noted in centro-parietal region.  No epileptiform discharges
are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does
not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, right, centro-parietal region
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG because of mild diffuse slowing that is
most pronounced over the right centroparietal region. Diffuse slowing diffuse cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically nonspecific.  Focal slowing is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are present,
but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
