CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed female admitted on the 16th with hypoglycemia  now with coma.   History of anxiety, depression, hepatitis C.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Lovenox, Pantoprazole, Zocor, Synthroid, Heparin, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Norvasc, Insulin
INTRODUCTION: Digital  video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and has some biting down activity.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a markedly abnormal pattern with theta and delta.  When reviewed at normal paper speed, there is a broad slow periodic complex. When reviewed with slower paper speed that periodic activity does show some evidence of frequency evolution as well as bursting, characteristic of a very slow, PLEDS plus-like pattern.
HR: 	100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Markedly abnormal and at times even discontinuous pattern.
2.	Periodic complexes.
3.		Periodic complexes with some evidence of frequency evolution as demonstrated by the use of very slow paper speed.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe encephalopathy which may be epileptogenic in nature.  This may represent an ictal or postictal pattern.
