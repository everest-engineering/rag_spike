CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old male with rupture of the right MCA artery. The patient underwent frontal temporal craniotomy, now with shivering movements.

MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl, Keppra, Gentamicin, Nimodipine, Labetalol, Hydralazine, Lovenox, Protonix, Vance, Zofran

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and has a temperature of 97 degrees.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Is markedly abnormal and demonstrates a significant asymmetry. At rest the right hemisphere is comprised of slow, low voltage delta waves and smaller amounts of theta waves. The left hemisphere demonstrates a bit more 6-7 Hz activity and there Is a suggestion of a posterior dominant rhythm. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta activity, much more prominent on the left side than the right. A single C4 sharp wave was noted There are occasional bursts of right frontal delta.

HR: 102 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffuse background slowing bilaterally.
2. Markedly slow pattern on the right as compared to the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural process affecting the white and gray matter. There were no clinical seizures seen. Modest motor activity was noted but was prominent shiver episodes.
