CLINICAL HISTORY:  Encephalopathy, hydrocephalus.
MEDICATIONS:  Baclofen, gabapentin, Dilantin, Trileptal, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible in this 20-minute bedside record.  Impedances were acceptable with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes which were slightly above 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG was markedly abnormal, diffusely slow.  It includes a mixture of theta, rhythmic theta, and slower arrhythmic delta.  There is a degree of periodicity to the EEG.  In addition, sharp waves are noted in the EEG.  These are variable and can be seen independently in the left frontotemporal region, right frontal central including FP2 or FZ or F4.  There are also some sharp waves noted less frequently in the left central parietal region.  Arrhythmic delta with some periodicity is noted in the frontal regions and the activity seems to have a different periodicity in the right and left frontal regions.  That activity on the right  spreads a bit more to the midline.  Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta. Rare triphasic waves were noted
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSIONS:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
A markedly abnormal background.
Multifocal sharp waves noted from either hemisphere at times with some periodicity but with a different periodicity in the 2 hemispheres.
Rare triphasic waves.
Arrhythmic delta in the frontal regions, particularly on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be correlated with imaging.  No seizures were recorded.  The overall EEG supports a diffuse, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function with more than 1 area of potential epileptogenicity.  In comparison to this patient's initial EEG on the 23rd, this is a higher amplitude more epileptiform appearing study.
