History:	71 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES.  PMHX: SZS, HTN, HLD, HCV, DM, MI 91.
PT WAS HERE IN 12/14 FOR  ? SZS.DUE TO BLOOD SUGAR
NOT ON MEDS.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the left more than right midtemporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is no evolution in frequency or amplitude to this
delta.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 90
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, bilateral (L>R) temporal, mid, No evolution in frequency or
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent rhythmic focal slowing in the
bilateral midtemporal (left more than right) regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
