CLINICAL HISTORY:  65 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, diabetes, pineal cyst, left temporal lobe complex partial epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Aggrenox, Norvasc, HCTZ, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, the EEG demonstrates subtle disorganization.
Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing bilateral theta and then left temporal focal theta.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is a abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left temporal region in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves or spikes were identified today.  The mild degree of background disorganization is a very mild finding for a subject of this age. This patient has had 6 EEGs including a LTM EEG monitoring in 2009.
