History:	72 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  TRANSFERRED FROM OSH FOR
SOB  AND CHEST PAIN X 1 WEEK, HAD NSTEM STARTED ON HEP, NIGHT OF
ADMIT INCRE WOB/INTUBATED. HOSPITAL COURSE COMP BY CARDIOGENIC
SHOCK ON 3/16
Medications:	Heparin, Levophed, Vasopressin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  With stimulation there was reactivity
with an increase in frequency. There is also some variability with intermittent short periods where
the background has a more defined A-P gradient with some alpha frequency discharge.  HR was 96
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, Some reactivity and variability.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
