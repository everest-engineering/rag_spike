CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old female with diabetes, hypertension, gout with right MCA/ACA stroke now with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Hydralazine.
REASON FOR EEG:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  No activating procedures were performed. Wakefulness and sleep are recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to posterior dominant rhythm of best 7-8 hertz with an amplitude of  20-60 microvolts which is related to eye opening. There is asymmetric frontocentral beta seen best over the left hemisphere and not on the right. Sleep is characterized by drowsiness stage I. No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen in the right hemisphere, maximal in the temporal and central regions with associated loss of faster frequencies.
Generalized slow waves of 5-7 hertz seen continuously.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
right hemispheric slow waves.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the right hemisphere maximal in the temporal and central regions which is consistent with a known stroke. In the region, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
