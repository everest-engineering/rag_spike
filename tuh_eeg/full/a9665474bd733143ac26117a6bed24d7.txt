CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old female with a history of hepatitis C virus, sarcoidosis, hypertension, bipolar, migraines, seizures described as staring, loss of consciousness and shaking with confusion after a while, last seizure in 2010.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxybutynin, Senna, Metaxalone, Gabapentin, Carbamazepine, Omeprazole
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:   None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is mainly in drowsiness but when in limited wakefulness there appears to be a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is some normal frontocentral beta. The background EEG is mainly in drowsiness and has bursts of mainly theta bursts at 5-7 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 mV.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As described above the patient easily goes into drowsiness with bursts of theta seen frequently throughout the recording, somewhat excessively for a normal EEG.
SEIZURES:  None.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to  etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
