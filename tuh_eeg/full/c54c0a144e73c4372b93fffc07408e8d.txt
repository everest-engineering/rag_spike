CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old right handed woman with right frontal hemangioma and daily episodes with headache and impaired balance.  Also, 3-4 dizzy spells per day.  She also has uncontrollable shaking of her jaw, titubation of her head and episodes of lacrimation with tremor.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is generous beta.  There is a 4.5 Hz tremor artifact noted in the EEG.  This is more prominent during photic stimulation.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  Despite the background artifacts from the patient's cranial tremor, there are rare bursts of right or left shifting slowing.

HR:    96 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within the limits of normal for an adult of this age given the movement artifact.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features noted.  Because of the degree of head tremor, a repeat study capturing more extensive sleep might be of value to more completely assess the cerebral pattern. The paperwork provided suggests that the EKG identified may be a new finding.  The clinical team will be contacted.
