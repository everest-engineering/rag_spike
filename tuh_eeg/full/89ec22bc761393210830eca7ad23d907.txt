History:	51 YO F,  PRESENTED WITH anoxic brain injury after a myocardial infarction. She
was intubated on versed drip in the CICU.
Medications:	VERSED, FENTANYL, HEPARIN, INSULIN, NOREPINEPHRINE,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded, comatose
Description:
There was diffuse muscle artifact almost throughout the recording. The patient was reportedly
received neuromuscular blocking agent towards the end of this routine EEG. The recording was
readable during the last 20-30 seconds of this recording which  characterized by intermittent bursts
of diffuse activity in theta and alpha range lasting 1-2 seconds separated by 1-2 seconds of
background discontinuity.  No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR is 100-110 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Technically inadequate
Attenuation
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY INADEQUATE EEG because of abundant EMG artifacts. Recording was
readable for a brief period of time after administration of neuromuscular blockade that showed
bursts of diffuse activity in alpha, beta, and theta range separated by periods of generalized
attenuation. These findings are consistent with diffuse severe cerebral dysfunction, which may be
due to toxic, metabolic or anoxic  encephalopathy or bilateral structural lesions. Clinical
correlation and a repeat EEG is recommended.
