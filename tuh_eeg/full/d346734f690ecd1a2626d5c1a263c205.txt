History:	65 year old woman with a history of severe TBI.
Medications:	none listed
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 1/12/2015 till 1/13/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events	0
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation/ during arousals, the background consists of a
mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with delta activity most pronounced anteriorly.  No
normal sleep architecture is noted but periods of quiescence are clearly present and are
characterized by diffuse moderate-to-high amplitude polymorphic delta activity.
No clearly sustained focal slowing is noted.  No electrographic seizures are present.
There is severe artifact in nearly all of the leads until ~ 12 PM.  That portion of the EEG is not
interpretable.  Bed percussion artifact is present.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24-hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No
clinical or electrographic seizures are present.  There is severe artifact in nearly all of the leads
until ~ 12 PM.  That portion of the EEG is not interpretable.
