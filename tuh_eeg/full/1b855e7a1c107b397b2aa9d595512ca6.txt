CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old, right-handed gentleman with history of aneurysm clipping, with history of seizures.  The patient has been seizure free for 5 years.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Topamax.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background activity was characterized by absence of a clear posterior dominant rhythm and a very low amplitude voltage recording.  There is a diffuse beta activity seen throughout the recording.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of a muscle and eye blink artifact and the presence of vertex sharp waves.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  Some focal slow waves are noted at anterior, temporal, and central area on the left side with some increase in faster frequencies at times.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to left frontocentral slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontocentral region, which is consistent with the known surgery.  The absence of a normal posterior dominant rhythm, although atypical could be a normal variant.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
