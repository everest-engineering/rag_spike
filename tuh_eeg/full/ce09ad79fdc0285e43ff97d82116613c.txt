AGE: 74 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/15/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : Inpatient
EEG TYPE: routine awake-only EEG #: 15-1354
HISTORY:
74 y.o. male referred for routine EEG for an episode of convulsion with left arm plegic, without known history of stroke or seizure. PMH: HTN, DM, prostate cancer, depression, hyperlipidemia, anemia.
MEDICATIONS :morphine, heparin, clindamycin, insulin, hydralazine, ASA, protonix, amlodipine, coreg, phenergan , vancomycin, Tylenol
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a a technically challenging study as the patient was agitated, creating much muscle artifact. The study included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by a symmetric but disorganized mixture of alpha, theta, and delta frequencies. There is no definite posterior dominant rhythm. Spontaneous eye movements are seen and moaning is noted by the technician .
Drowsiness and sleep are not clearly captured.
There is mild to moderate generalized slowing . No definite focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Not performed Photic Stimulation: Not performed
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal, though technically limited (due to frequent diffuse muscle artifact) awake-only routine EEG due to:
Mild to moderate generalized slowing
Disorganized background
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are non-specific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction .
