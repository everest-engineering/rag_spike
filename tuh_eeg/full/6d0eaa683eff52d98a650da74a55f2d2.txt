CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old right handed male who is status post subdural hematoma evaluation 3/22/2011. Seizure on 3/29/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Plavix, Gabapentin, Lipitor,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has had a recent
craniotomy. He is intubated ..
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes rhythmic higher
amplitude mixed theta, delta frequency activity. There is some shifting amplitude
asymmetries including left frontal. There are a handful of sharply contoured wave forms,
left frontal and right mid temporal. The overall pattern, however, is one is mixed
rhythmic theta and delta with shifting asymmetries. Intermittent attenuations are noted in
the background.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing with a mixture of theta and delta.
2. A handful of left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to the previous study, this EEG is higher
amplitude and much slower. Correlation with clinical factors including imaging and
potential toxic or metabolic correlates is suggested.
