History:	75 year old man undergoing a complex cardiac surgery: CABG, AVR and
aneurysmal repair.  No hypothermia protocol initiated.

INCISION: 8:55AM
HEPARIN: 9:20AM 3200 UNITS
CIRC.ARREST: NOT PERFORMING
BYPASS  10:08AM.
CARDIAC ARREST: 10:18A
COOL:  10:11AM
SUPPRESSION:   N/A
WARM:  11:45A
Medications:	SEVOFLURANE-> ISOFLURANE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, comatose
Description:
Patient is intubated and sedated by the time the recording starts.  Early in the recording the
background consists of a diffuse monomorphic ~10 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity admixed
with bursts of theta and delta activity and occasional periods of discontinuity.  As the recording
progresses, alpha activity evolves into moderate amplitude theta activity admixed with periods of
discontinuity.  Mild degree of burst-suppression is seen by ~ 10:14 am.  Cardiac arrest is achieved
by ~ 10:18 am.    Background changes to discontinuous by ~ 10:52 am.  Heart rate reappears on a
single EKG lead by ~ 12:50 am.  By the end of the recording the background is continuous and
consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and alpha activity.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an unremarkable nearly 5 hour continuous intraoperative EEG.  Progress was intermittently
monitored remotely by the attending physician. Hypothermia was never therapeutic and complete
suppression was never achieved.
