CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old man who presented with right-sided seizures; Past medical history include: Hypertension, cirrhosis and CVA.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, and the patient received 8 mg of Ativan a few hours before the recording.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  The long-term record was reviewed for abnormalities and clinical events.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Interictal EEG:  The recording from 04/15/2013 to 04/16/2013 was characterized by diffuse slowing.  There was also continuous polymorphic slowing at T3 in the 4-5 Hz range intermixed with 2-3 Hz frequency, which was frequently sharply contoured.  Occasional sharp waves were noted at T3.
From 10 p.m. onwards, the amount of sharp waves had significantly decreased. Towards the end of the recording, no sharp waves were seen.
Ictal Events:  There was one push button at 8:51 p.m., during which time clinically the patient was moving around.
Ictal EEG:  There was no EEG correlate to the push button event at 8:51 p.m.
Some sleep element characterized by sleep spindles were noted, but there was no definite sleep architecture recorded.
IMPRESSION:  This long-term EEG recording is abnormal due to:
Diffuse bilateral slowing.
Focal left T3 continuous polymorphic slowing in the theta and delta range sharply contoured.
Sharp waves at T3 without evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
The generalized slowing is suggestive of a diffuse process, such as toxic metabolic process versus medication induced versus a postictal state.
Left focal slowing, which is continuous and most pronounced in the left frontocentral and mid temporal regions is suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality, which is consistent with a known stroke in that region.
The left temporal sharps are consistent with epileptogenicity at T3 that places this patient at high risk of localization-related epilepsy.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
