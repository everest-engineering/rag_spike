CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old woman with methotrexate overdose, hypotensive, renal failure on dialysis with progressive impairment of awareness since November 30.

MEDICATIONS:  Versed, Lipitor, lacosamide, morphine

INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is somewhat somnolent, but responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The initial EEG demonstrates frontally predominant triphasic waves with an anterior to posterior lag.  In addition, there are a handful of sharp waves also noted in the background.  The patient is somewhat responsive.

The wave forms were briefly responsive to Versed.

As the recording continued, the patient remained confused.  Triphasic waves were noted in a background of diffuse slowing with somewhat irregular mixed theta delta and occasional sharp waves noted in the frontal regions.

Heart rate 84 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
* Markedly abnormal background.
* Triphasic waves which did demonstrate some response to Versed.
* Occasional sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most suggestive of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, however, given the overall picture and the presence of sharp waves, subclinical seizures should be considered and additional EEG monitoring was initiated.
