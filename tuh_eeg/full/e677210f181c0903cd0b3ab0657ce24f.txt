CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed woman with history of seizures since age 20, prior one 1 year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Vitamins.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 and F7/T3 independently at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts occasionally throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild independent bilateral anterior temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the independent bilateral anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
