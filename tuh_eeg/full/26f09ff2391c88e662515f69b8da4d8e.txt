CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old woman with right craniotomy, UTI, renal failure.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Isosorbide, Zocor, Plavix, Synthroid, Metoprolol, Lacosamide, Labetalol, Vancomycin, Lorazepam, Hydroxyzine, Toradol, Heparin, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is somewhat agitated. There is a great deal of muscle and movement artifact in this bedside recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is a prominent interhemispheric asymmetry particularly on the right where there is a craniotomy. On the right, there is marked disruption of faster frequency with high amplitude spike and wave activity with a generous field of spread including right frontal, frontotemporal and frontocentral regions.
It is accompanied by after going slow waves. The amplitude of the epileptiform activity exceeds 200 microvolts. The left hemisphere demonstrates background theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing, right more so than left. In maximal wakefulness, most of the background EEG remains markedly slow.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude spikes and sharps out of the right hemisphere.
2. Right sided focal delta.
3. Generalized background slowing.
