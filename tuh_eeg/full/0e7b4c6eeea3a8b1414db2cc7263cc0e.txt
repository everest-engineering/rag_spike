CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed woman with a history of seizures, status post MVA with head trauma, dementia, hypertension, now with jerking in the right arm and slurred speech.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Aricept, Lorazepam, Lisinopril, Protonix, Lovenox, Lacosamide, Namenda
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This EEG compromised elements of wakefulness and also drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a disorganized background with continuous high amplitude sharp waves that are localized in T1, T3, T7, in addition to the occipital region. Furthermore, there is a generous delta slowing in the right side with some generous spread in the right frontal temporal region. Elements of drowsiness are intermittently in the delta and during drowsiness there is an increase in delta background. Hyperventilation does not appear to aggravate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. High amplitude sharp waves with a generous field of spread.
2. Focal delta in the right side.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings of sharp waves and focal delta slowing are associated with a structural process in the left side of the brain. In addition, as suggested above highly epileptogenic features. Patient may benefit from an outpatient DigiTrace.
