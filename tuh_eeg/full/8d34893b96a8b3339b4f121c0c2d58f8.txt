CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old right handed woman status post aneurysm repair from the
left parietal occipital region in 1981. Questionable history of epilepsy on chronic Dilantin. Status
post slip and fall accident on December 31 with facial contusions, poor memory and depression.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Toprol, Lovastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background E.EEG demonstrates an
asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres. The alpha rhythm on the right is approximately 9.5
herb: and on the left Is a bit slower. There is an occasional focal slowing in the left posterior
temporal region. Some of this is sharply contoured in T5 or T1. There is also some bilateral
posterior slowing or some shifting occipital slowing T5 versus 02. Features of drowsiness
Include an accentuation of the focal slowing In the left mid posterior temporal region which also
involves C3. Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic
stimulation elicits a scant driving response particularly at faster frequencies.
HR: 60 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Focal slowing primarily in the left posterior region including Ts much more than T3 or T11
T3,C3.
2.
An interhemispheric asymmetry with slower frequency activity on the left compared lo the
right.
CORRELATION: Although there is some sharply contoured slowing, there are no
definitive epileptiform features observed. If epilepsy is an Important consideration, a more
prolonged study capturing more extensive sleep may be considered.
