CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old man with past medical history of recent motor vehicle accident now presents with cognitive difficulties, memory difficulties, new onset headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Crestor and a sleeping pill.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 Hz activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess beta is captured.  During sleep, sleep spindles and POSTS (posterior occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation produce no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 40 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
