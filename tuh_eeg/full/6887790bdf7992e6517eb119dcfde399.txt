History:	61 YO MALE - HYPOXIC BRAIN INJURY. PT WAS BEING WEANED FROM
SEDATION AND HAD A SZ. EEG TO EVALUATE.
Medications:	KEPPRA, ATIVAN, PROPOFOL (30), FENTANYL INJECTION, INSULIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. At the beginning of the record there is a diffuse burst
suppression pattern. The bursts consist of  diffuse low voltage delta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  Later the background becomes more
continuous.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  During the record periodic generalized complex polyphasic sharp
waves are present, with a repetition rate of 0.8 Hz. At the beginning of the record these are in
infrequent and low amplitude.  By the end of the record these appear to have a myogenic artifact
correlate. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), frequent generalized
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 6.25 hour EEG because of frequent generalized periodic epileptiform
discharges and severe  diffuse background slowing.  These findings are supportive of a severe
diffuse cerebral dysfunction and irritability which in setting of hypoxia and in the absence of
sedation carries a poor prognosis.
