CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed female with a history of seizures in 2010 described as grand mal tonic-clonic shaking with loss of consciousness afterwards and confusion.  Has a brother with seizures as a child.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation revealed no abnormal discharges and photic stimulation revealed nice photic driving.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal sharp waves seen occasionally at T3 and at times at T5 with a mild T3 component.  These, at times, were not very well formed and can be seen occasionally.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left mid temporal and some posterior temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of  localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left mid temporal to posterior temporal region.  No seizures were seen.
