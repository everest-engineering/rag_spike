CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old woman with 2 headaches in June 2010 and July 2010, recurrent left sided headache. The patient previously on Topamax, but stopped due to pregnancy. Miscarriage in October 2010. Please evaluate for seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Albuterol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low voltage pattern, but there is symmetric reactive 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta. In stage 2 sleep we see runs of vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles, as well as POSTS. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not activate the record.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal low voltage EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is
suggested.
