History:	28 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O PAIN/PRESSURE IN CENTRAL-
OCCIPITAL AREA OF HEAD ONSET 06/2013 ALONG WITH A FEELING LIKE HE
IS GOING TO FAINT/ TINGLING SENSATION OF BODY ALL LASTING 1 MIN. PT
DENIES LOC/FAINTING. SZ HX IN FAMILY FATHER.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
As the record opens there is subtle left sided focal slowing with the appearance of intermittent left
fronto-temporal theta. This may also reflect an asymmetric drowsiness pattern.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces minimal effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 10-15Hz. .
Summary of Findings:
Alpha rhythm, normal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy due to subtle focal theta slowing over the left
hemisphere. No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded. Focal
slowing may also represent asymmetric drowsiness pattern.   If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.
