CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed male with stroke, epilepsy after the stroke 5 years ago, left-sided weakness, past history of tonic-clonic seizures 3 hours prior to admission, on 6/10/2010, with tongue biting followed by postictal hiccups or hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Labetalol, Dilantin, ASA, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an awake pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm reaching 9 Hz. There is intermittent theta noted in the background and variability in the overall degree of organization. Early in relaxed wakefulness, focal slowing is noted in the left hemisphere with arrhythmic delta, disruption of faster frequency activity and occasional sharp waves. Hiccup artifact is not associated with epileptiform activity. The hiccups do produce a tiny brief burst of muscle artifact. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation does not elicit significant driving. Relatively frequent left temporal sharp waves are noted around the time of photic stimulation but, again, are not associated with the hiccups and persist after the photic concludes.
HR: 104 bpm and irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
3. Mild background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The hiccups are not a seizure. Additional evaluation for the patient's irregular and rapid heart rate is suggested.
