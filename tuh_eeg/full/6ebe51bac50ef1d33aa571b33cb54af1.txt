CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old male with severe chronic static encephalopathy, early morning seizures characterized by vocalization then tremulousness.  Patient walks to the bedroom after the seizures and lays down.  Mother thinks that they tend to occur when he has physical discomfort such as constipation or straining at toilet.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Risperdal, Claritin, and Valium.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is primarily an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall background is a low voltage, diffusely slow record, lacking in normal developmental milestones for patient of this age.  The bursts of shifting slowing were noted with medium amplitude delta, which was somewhat more prominent in the right hemisphere than the left.
As the recording continues, as the patient became agitated, there is an increase in muscle.  Brief drowsiness was remarkable for a bit more delta in the right frontal region.
Heart rate 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse background slowing.
Shifting slowing sometimes left posterior quadrant, but other times a bit more prominent in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record and in fact epileptiform features were not identified in any of the previous studies.  This EEG demonstrates a bit more focal slowing on the right.  However, given the low level of patient cooperativity and the inability of to measure the patient's cranium correctly, these findings should be interpreted with caution.
