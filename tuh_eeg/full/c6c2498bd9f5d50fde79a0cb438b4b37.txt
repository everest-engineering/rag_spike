CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 78-year-old woman with prior strokes in 2004 and 2008, new onset tonic-clonic seizures and left PCA infarct 2 years ago.  Patient now with episodes of shaking left hand, eyes open, spaced out. Found by EMS with  whole body shaking.
MEDICINES:  Depakote, Insulin and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.  This is a technically acceptable record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage, diffusely slow with a mixture of lower voltage delta, smaller amounts of theta and some beta.  There is a subtle underlying asymmetry noted with occasional, somewhat paroxysmal slow delta followed by brief attenuations noted from the left hemisphere.  There are also subtle attenuations noted from the right.
Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster frequency activity.
As the patient seems to drift off to sleep, there is an increase in theta, more so on the right than the left.
Heart rate 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is markedly abnormal due to:
Marked background slowing.
Subtle asymmetries with a bit of disruption of faster frequency activity on the left and some rare bursts of paroxysmal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The focal features noted in this record were quite subtle.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study in the lab may be possible when the patient starts to recover.
