CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 72-year-old male with aneurysm in the posterior wall of the right carotid before coiling.

MEDICATIONS:  Sevoflurane, propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium, vecuronium, phenylephrine, and heparin.

INTRODUCTION:  Two hour digital EEG was performed in the interventional suite using standard CEA montage with 1-channel EKG.  Physician was available for review throughout the EEG and remote review was performed for 30 minutes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG began with the patient awake in the OR with symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  With the use of anesthetic medications, the EEG became discontinuous and operative team was informed.  The EEG was continuous by 12:27.

The stent was deployed at 12:46.  No focal findings were noted.  EEG recording was continued through 01:20 p.m. with remote physician review and no focal features were noted.

Heart rate 90 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  EEG monitoring during this right carotid coiling was remarkable for the absence of focal features.  At transient burst, suppression pattern was noted early in the procedure, compatible with the use of anesthetic medications.
