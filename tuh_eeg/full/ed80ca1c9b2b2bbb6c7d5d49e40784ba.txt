CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old male admitted with MI, status post CABG with a complicated course, now with confusion and agitation.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background includes a dynamic pattern with rhythmic 6 to 7 Hz theta, which is intermittently disrupted by median amplitude bursts of irregular or regular 1 to 2 Hz delta. Stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Bursts of arrhythmic delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific but are relatively typical of a metabolic encephalopathy.  There were no focal features or epileptiform features.
