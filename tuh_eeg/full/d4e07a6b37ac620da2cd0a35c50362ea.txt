CLINICAL HISTORY:  27-year-old gravida 2 female with multiple, as many as 3 tonic-clonic seizures after delivery.  No hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, magnesium, Xanax, Klonopin, Suboxone.
ROOM NUMBER:  Labor and Delivery 7.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent with brief arousals to tactile stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The vast majority of the EEG demonstrates a drowsy pattern with diffuse beta.  Occasional vertex waves and spindles were noted.  With brief stimulation, eye opening is noted and there is a glimpse of 9 Hz alpha rhythm in a pattern rich in beta frequency activity.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for,
Excess beta.
A small amount of excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Medications may play a role in the pattern described above.  No epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study when the patient is out of the labor and delivery suite is suggested.
