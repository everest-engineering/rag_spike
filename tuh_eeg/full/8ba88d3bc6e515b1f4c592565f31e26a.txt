LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of seizures, diabetes, hypertension, depression and breast cancer.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Topamax, insulin, Dilantin,  Lipitor, Klonopin, lisinopril, aspirin and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard the 10-20  system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  During maximal wakefulness the posterior dominant rhythm consists of 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Fast alpha variant is occasionally observed.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), 2 to 3 second bursts of diffuse sharply contoured theta activity, symmetrical sleep spindles and vertex waves are noted.  Hyperventilation is performed with   poor effort and does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in significant change in the background.  The patient is either drowsy or asleep throughout most of the recording.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal mostly drowsy or asleep and briefly awake 27 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
