History:	42 R OLD FEMALE R HANDED PMHX. N/A C/C PT HAS WHAT SHE BELIEVES
ARE GRAND MAL SEIZURES.
Medications:	KEPPRA, TEGRETOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontocentral regions.  There is mild excess underlying background theta activity.  During
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild symmetric
bifrontal delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces
minimal symmetric photic driving response.  HR 66.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing,
which is etiologically nonspecific and may be medication induced.  This is the second EEG for this
patient. In comparison to the previous record, no sharply contoured focal slowing at T1 is present,
but mild background theta is still noted.
