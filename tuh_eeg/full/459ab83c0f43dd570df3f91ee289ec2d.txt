History:	40 YR MALE S/P ACOUSTIC NEUROMA RESEC.  ON 6/8 PT FELL CT. RIGHT FRONTAL CONTUSION.  PT DENIES MEMORY OF EVENT.  SKULL DEFECT LEFT TRANS-LABYRINTH EXCISION .  NO PMHX OF SZ BUT HAD EPISODE 2006
Medications:	KEPPRA, NAPROXEN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description: Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. Symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
HR is 54.  There appears to be a continuous impedance artifact seen over the left hemisphere.
Summary of Findings: No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation: This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
