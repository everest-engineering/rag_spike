CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed male with 4 tonic clonic seizures, past history of epilepsy, MVA trauma, burns. Post traumatic epilepsy since the age of 16 and psychiatric disorder.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Keppra, Benadryl, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. It is primarily a theta delta pattern with a glimpse of a 9 hertz alpha rhythm on the right. There seems to be a breech rhythm with higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right. Sharp waves are identified most of which have a T1 phase reversal, but there are a handful of sharp waves which start at T2, lower voltage and then higher amplitude, left anterior temporal T2-F7. The sharp waves seem to be accentuated by hyperventilation. The focal slowing on the left is also accentuated by hyperventilation. Although there is no mention of a previous craniotomy, there is higher amplitude activity on the left and as the patient becomes drowsy, there is a bit more focal left frontal temporal delta. Photic stimulation produces scant driving more apparent on the right than the left.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Focal slowing on the left compared to the right.
3. Sharp waves seem primarily from the left, but some of which start on the right and end on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal process on the left involving gray and white matter. In addition, the overall background is slow suggesting a bihemispheric process. Correlation with imaging is appropriate, but overall, this EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures.
