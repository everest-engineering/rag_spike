REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old woman with hypertension, GERD, asthma, diabetes, last MCA stroke on July 11, 2012, ambulatory dysfunction, and aphasia, here for followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, Restoril, clonidine, Mirapex, ranitidine, and Singulair.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximal at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 54 and regular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to continuous left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
