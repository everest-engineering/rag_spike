INTRODUCTION:
A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and
EKG electrodes. Activation procedures including photic stimulation was performed. Sleep stage I was seen.
MEDICATIONS:

CLINICAL DIFFICULTIES:
None.
HISTORY:
All 80-year-old woman with possible syncopal episodes and memory impairment.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
The record opens to a mildly slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm of 8Hz and an of 20 to 50
microvolts. Some frontocentral beta was seen. Stage I sleep was noted. Photic stimulation did produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Mild generalized slow waves that 5 to 7 Hz and 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
