CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old right handed man with a history of a right epidural abscess with a drain in March 2012.  He now has a headache for 5 days.
MEDICATIONS:  Flagyl, Moxifloxacin, Prednisone, Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During sleep, vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are observed.  There are no epileptiform discharges.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal 23-minute awake and asleep EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on an routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
