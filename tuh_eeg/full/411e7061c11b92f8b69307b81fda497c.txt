History:	83 YO MALE  BROUGHT IN BY EMS S/P PEA CODE. EMS EPI X 4, CPR IN ED
EPI X 3. INDICATION STROKE AND POSSIBLE HYPOXIC EVENT
PMHX: DM, CAP, HTN, HLD, CKD
Medications:	HYDRALAZINE, INSULIN, DEXTROSE, POTASSIUM
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and ekg
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing was present.  No epileptiform discharges were present.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was stimulation reactivity in the
background activity.  HR is 80 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Attenuation
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and attenuation.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
