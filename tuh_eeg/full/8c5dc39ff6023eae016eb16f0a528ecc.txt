START DATE OF STUDY : 09/28/2015 at 00:51 END DATE OF STUDY: 9/29/2015 at 12:51
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : ICU EEG TYPE : LTM
EEG #: 15-267
HISTORY:
68 y .o. male with a history of seizures, in the setting of status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:
Dilantin, Keppra , Valproic acid SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system . This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG .
DAY 1 (9/28/2015, 00:51 - 9/28/2015, 08:00) BACKGROUND:
The waking background is continuous, symmetric, poorly-organized, and consists predominantly of delta and theta with admixed alpha , and beta.
Sleep is characterized by further background slowing to delta activity; sleep transients are absent. In sleep there are frequent <l second periods of diffuse attenuation.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None present
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events were reported or detected.
DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
1. Moderate to severe background slowing and disorganization
These findings are consistent with moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
DAY 2 (9/28/2015, 08:00 - 9/29/2015, 08:00)
BACKGROUND: none. Note that background can be obscured by diffuse muscle artifact for periods up to 15 min.
GENERALIZED SLOWING: no change
FOCAL SLOWING: no change
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
No change from Day 1, evaluation somewhat limited by periods of muscle artifact.
DAY 3 (9/29/2015, 08:00 - 9/29/2015, 12:51)
BACKGROUND: Improvement in organization from poor to fair; less delta in wakefulness
GENERALIZED SLOWING: Mild generalized slowing FOCAL SLOWING: none
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): none SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: none
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Improved waking background organization. Mild diffuse slowing.
FINAL IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal video EEG due to:
Background slowing, which improves by Day 3 from "moderate-to-severe " to "mild"
Background disorganization, which improves by Day 3 from "poor" to "fair"
FINAL CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings demonstrate diffuse cerebral dysfunction which improves over the course of the study as described above.
