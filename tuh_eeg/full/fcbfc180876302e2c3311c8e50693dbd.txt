History:	51 year old man with a history of seizures.  Patient has 2 episodes per month.
Medications:	Keppra, lamictal, neurontin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low voltage diffuse fast activity.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-
25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Subtle occasional polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted over the left anterior temporal
region.  A single sharply contoured waveform is captured over the left anterior temporal region.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, anterior, subtle
Sharp transients, one, left temporal, anterior
Sleep, stage 2
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 1 hour EEG because of subtle occasional mild left
anterior temporal slowing.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The single sharply contoured waveform
emanating from the left anterior temporal region is of unclear clinical significance.  Excessive beta
activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
