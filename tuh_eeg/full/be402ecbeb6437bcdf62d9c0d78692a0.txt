REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 20-year-old woman with a history of VNS placed on 2011, seizure-free since then until April 1, 2013 when she had a seizure being dizzy, eye blinking, and falling out.  Upon arousal was tired and sleepy.  She has a history of ADHD.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, lamotrigine, Adderall.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded mainly in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Please note that there was almost continuous eye movements throughout the recording, at times seen in nystagmoid fashion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is mildly excessive frontal central beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  At times there is some sharply contoured frontal component but not clearly epileptiform.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
Heart rate 90.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy and prolonged recording capturing sleep may be helpful in clarifying the diagnosis.
