CLINICAL HISTORY:  Refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A continuous video EEG was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In drowsiness there is an increase in theta.  Eye flutter is noted in significant portions of the record.  There is often a drowsy pattern with more of a theta frequency background.  Sleep is relatively fragmented.  Stage 2 sleep continues to demonstrate frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity with polys, spike and wave activity.  The spike and wave activity may be a little slower in sleep.  On the whole, it is frontally predominant and symmetric.
IMPRESSION:  This continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for;
Frontally predominant spike and wave activity seen almost exclusively in sleep but occasionally in early drowsiness.
Intermittent pattern of background theta noted, which is difficult to discern from the drowsy pattern with a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  This pattern was noted a little bit later in the EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Although no seizures were recorded, overall, this 4-day EEG monitoring session is most supportive of a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.
