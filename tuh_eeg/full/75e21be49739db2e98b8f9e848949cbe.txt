History:	22 YO FEMALE WITH SZ HX, SUFFERED A SZ WHILE CURRENTLY 10 WEEKS
PREGNANT. PT ALSO COMPLAINS OF MIGRAINES.
PMHX: SZ AND CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE?
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral occipital regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral occipital
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
occipital region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-
specific, but possibly structural in origin.
