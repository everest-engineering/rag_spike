REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 50-year-old man presents with a history of generalized tonic clonic seizures followed by 30 minutes post event confusion.  Past medical history of being mute since age 3, developmental delay and seizure disorder.

MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Depakote, carbamazepine.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  Brief wakefulness and predominantly sleep were recorded.  Activation procedures included photic stimulation.

Technical problems:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is predominantly stage 1 and stage 2 sleep with limited periods of wakefulness.  In a brief period of wakefulness the background is of 5-7 Hz frequency.  It never reaches the frequency of a normal posterior dominant rhythm.

He falls asleep very quickly and goes into stage 1 and stage 2 sleep characterized by vertex waves, K complexes and sleep spindles.

Photic stimulation does not change the record.

Abnormal discharges:
1. Excess theta in wakefulness.
2. Infrequent left anterior temporal slowing.
3. Short sleep latency.

Seizures:  None.

Heart rate 60 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta in wakefulness.
2. Infrequency left anterior temporal slowing.
3. Short sleep latency.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region and diffuse cerebral dysfunction which are both nonspecific in etiology.  The short sleep latency may be due to medication effect or it may be indicative of sleep disorder.
