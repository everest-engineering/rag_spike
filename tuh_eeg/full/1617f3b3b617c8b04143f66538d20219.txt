CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 68-year-old male, nursing home resident with AIDS, low CD4 count; COPD; epilepsy; hypertension; DVT; dementia; and renal failure.  Patient is increasingly somnolent with limited movement on the right on November 30th, better Dec 1, 2014
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Ativan, fluconazole, many others, acyclovir, and Solu-Medrol.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically somewhat challenging record for a patient who is somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is diffusely slow low voltage with a pattern of slow, low voltage, featureless delta and theta.  In drowsiness, at slow paper speeds, there is a very subtle underlying slow focus noted in the right hemisphere with some degree of periodicity.  Stimulation of the patient at the end of the record produces an alerting response with eye opening, eye closure, and spontaneous movements of the right, but a slow, low voltage featureless background on the left.
Heart rate: 140 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Subtle underlying slow periodic delta noted during sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No sharp waves were noted.  The overall assessment for this EEG is a markedly slow record, compatible with toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or other, significant diffuse CNS process including multi infarct state or advanced CNS HIV infection.  Right focal features can be correlated with imaging
