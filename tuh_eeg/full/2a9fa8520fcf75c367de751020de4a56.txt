CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old male with an episode of generalized shaking and loss of consciousness. Sitting in his chair he fell backwards, eyes rolled up and he shook for 5 minutes.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake through stage II sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 12 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by abundant vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS.

Heart rate 78 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in a very sleepy patient.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Sleep deprivation and medications may play a role in the hypersomnolent record recorded.
