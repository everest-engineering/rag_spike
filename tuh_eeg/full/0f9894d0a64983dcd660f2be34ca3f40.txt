CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed female with a history of hyperlipidemia, depression, hypothyroidism, and epilepsy with frequent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Soma, Lamotrigine, Levothyroxine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.  The EEG was recorded only in wakefulness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which are reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  No sleep is captured.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 and F8/T4 frequently throughout the recording.
Focal slow waves seen also at F7/T3 and F8/T4, seen intermittently at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.  During one period in the left anterior temporal region there was monomorphic discharge consistent with temporal intermittent rhythmic delta [TIRDA].
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral anterior temporal sharp wave.
Focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, with seizures likely arising from either temporal lobe.  No seizures were captured.
