History:	58 year old man with a history of a single seizure.
Medications:	None
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left anterior temporal region during.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and exacerbates focal
slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per
second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, anterior, mild-to-moderate
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 42-minute EEG due to occasional mild-to-moderate left
anterior temporal focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
