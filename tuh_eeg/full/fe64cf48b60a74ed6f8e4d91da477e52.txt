CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 60-year-old woman with sarcoid and change in mental status, evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Midazolam, vancomycin, meropenem, CellCept, Prograf, Medrol, ganciclovir, and many others.
INTRODUCTION: A 20-minute routine digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Post impedances were under 5 kg Ohms. There was some bedside artifact noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is somewhat poorly responsive during the record. There is a glimpse of an 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm noted bilaterally. There is background theta. The resting background is intermittently disrupted by bursts of rhythmic frontal delta.  Intermittent shifting arrhythmic slowing is also noted, more remarkable as the recording continues in the left hemisphere than the right, maximum in the temporal regions.
Heart rate: 75.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to.
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. The shifting slowing is a bit more prominent on the left. Overall, this EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, which may include a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.  Correlation with imaging may be of value.
