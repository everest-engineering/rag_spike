AGE: 46 y.o.
SEX: female
DATE OF STUDY: 11/10/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT : outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 15-1653
HISTORY:
46 y.o. female with a history of memory loss, hypertension, and thyroid disease referred for routine EEG for evaluation of memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
misoprostol (CYTOTEC) 200 mcg tablet, Take 200 mcg by mouth 2 times daily.
bupropion (WELLBUTRIN SR) 150 mg 12 hr tablet, Take 150 mg by mouth 2 times daily.
Cholecalciferol, Vitamin D3, 2,000 unit Capsule, Take 2,000 Units by mouth daily (with dinner) .
hydrochlorothiazide	(HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 0.5 tablets by mouth daily. Indications: Hypertension
capsaicin 0.025 % cream, Apply	topically 3 times daily. levothyroxine (SYNTHROID, LEVOTHROID) 150 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
Diclofenac Sodium 1 % Gel, Apply 2 g topically 4 times daily. diclofenac (VOLTAREN) 50 mg EC tablet, Take 50 mg by mouth 3 times daily.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a
NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 10-10.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening .
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	Occasionally during drowsiness there 1-2 second periods of diffuse sharply contoured theta slowing, bi-temporal predominant.
Sleep is not captured.
No generalized slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving, which is a normal finding.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 84 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION / CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is an essentially normal awake and drowsy routine EEG. Sharply contoured theta slowing, bi-temporal predominant may be a pattern seen in drowsiness . However, if clinically indicated, a repeat routine study or prolonged study capturing sleep may be helpful.
