Clinical HISTORY: 76 year old male with sellar tumor, prostate cancer, CABG and seller mass.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Synthroid, Ativan, Acetaminophen, Zocor, Protonix, Zestril, Lovenox, Hydrocortisone, Percocet, Vancomycin, Cefepime

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is remarkable for generous beta and theta. Snare artifact is noted. As the patient drifts off to sleep, the muscle activity drops out and there is more of a beta with delta pattern. Slow spindle activity is noted. Stimulation of the patient is performed on 2 occasions and produces an increase in beta on one occasion and the other does not seem to awaken the patient at all.

HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: A normal EEG due to:
1. Pattern of hypersomnolence.
2. Excess beta and theta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. Clinical correlation may be important to determine why this individual is so sleepy.
