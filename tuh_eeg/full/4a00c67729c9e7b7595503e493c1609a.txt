CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84-year-old male with past stroke, hypertension, diabetes.  The patient reports that he has had multiple episodes that he describes as sugar attacks.  Had an episode leaving church which he described as a presyncopal event but which bystanders noted was associated with post event confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, insulin, Norvasc.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In stage 2 sleep vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts were noted.
Notable in this record were intermittent bursts of somewhat rhythmic 3-4 Hz delta activity.  Some of the bursts were sustained.  A handful of these are sharply contoured but without a definitive sharp and slow wave complex.  Wicket was also noted in relaxed wakefulness.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic, left temporal focal slowing.
Sharply contoured left temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive sharp waves were seen although there was some sharply contoured slowing.  This EEG supports a structural functional abnormality on the left and may be correlated with imaging.  It is a pattern that is not atypical for epilepsy but this individual does have a previous left frontal infarct.
