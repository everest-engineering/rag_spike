CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 79-year-old woman, status post traumatic left temporal subdural hematoma and contusion as well as sphenoid sinus fracture.  The patient is now increasingly drowsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra, morphine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly responsive, and in a hard collar, which impacts electrode placement.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with diffuse 5 hertz theta and intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity. Occasional bursts of sharply contoured delta were noted, maximum in the left mid temporal region.  When unstimulated, the EEG becomes a bit slower with intermittent attenuations and rare vertex waves.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Marked background slowing.
Occasional focal slowing in the left hemisphere, which may be sharply contoured at P3 or left mid temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generalized background slowing supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as may be seen in the context of traumatic brain injury or with the use of sedative hypnotic medications.  The focal features in this record are ipsilateral to the head trauma.  No seizures were recorded.
