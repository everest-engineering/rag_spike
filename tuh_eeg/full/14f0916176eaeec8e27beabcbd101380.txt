History:	50 YO MALE PRESENTS WITH RIGHT SIDED WEAKNESS INVOLVING ARM, LEG,
FACE AND SLURRED SPEECH WHILE AT REHAB. PT'S HAD REPEAT EPISODES
OF TRANSIENT RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS SINCE 1992.
Medications:	Atorvastatin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present diffusely.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes
more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness
progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal region (right more
than left) during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
66. Please note the EKG lead appeared to have an impedance artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral (R>L) temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bilateral midtemporal region (right more than left) region.  This finding is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  Excessive
beta can be seen with the use of benzodiazepines or barbituates among other medications.
