History:	63 YR OLD FEMALE WITH PMHX ESRD, DVT/PG, CVA, PNA, THYROID
DISORDER. NEW ONSET SZ 12/2014, PRESENTS FOR FOLLOW UP W/INCREA IN
SZ ACTIVITY PER DAUGHTER/ PT HAD 2 SZ TWO WEEKS AGO. SHAKING AND
POSTICTAL CONFUSION
Medications:	Dilantin, 2MG Ativan IM, Phenytoin 100MG 3x a day
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by disorganized
diffuse high amplitude frontal delta with more posterior theta activity and absence of the expected
anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bifrontal region during wakefulness.
Occasional focal sharp waves are present in the bifrontal region, with phase reversal and amplitude
maximum at F4/F3.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR 72
Summary of Findings:
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges and focal slowing in the
bilateral frontal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this
region. In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
