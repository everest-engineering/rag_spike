CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old right handed male with headaches, past history of
stroke and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Tegretol, Gabapentin, Diazepam, Lisinopril, Simvastatin,
ASA, Oscal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates bilateral
background slowing with a superimposed asymmetry. The alpha rhythm on the right is
7.5 to 8 hertz and on the left in the 600-700 range. In addition, the overall background is somewhat higher amplitude on the left globally, somewhat slower with occasional
arrhythmic delta activity in the left mid to posterior temporal region. Features of
drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant
driving on the right.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere.
2. Disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional process on
the left involving gray and white matter, but no epileptiform features were noted.
