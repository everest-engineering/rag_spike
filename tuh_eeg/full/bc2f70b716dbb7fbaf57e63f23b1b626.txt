REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old right handed lady presents with a history of seizure disorder.  Last seizure was 2 weeks ago with loss of consciousness. The event lasted 30 seconds.  The patient had an aura of tingling.  She was back to baseline in 2 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Sleep and wakefulness were captured.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is posterior dominant rhythm of 10 Hz frequency and 30-50 microvolts in amplitude which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is diffuse beta of about 16 Hz.
Sleep was captured and was characterized by diffuse slowing and sleep spindles.
Hyperventilation was performed which did not change the recording significantly.
Photic stimulation was performed and a good driving response was noted at intermediate flash frequencies.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Infrequent left anterior temporal slowing was seen at F7 in the delta range.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep EEG due to the presence of infrequent left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is reveal evidence of local cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region. Which is non-specific with regards to etiology. No epileptiform discharges were found.  Clinical correlation recommended.
