CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed female with a history of bipolar disease
and head trauma in 2009, who presented with memory loss and headache.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Risperidone, Nabumetone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.
There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. There are some features of drowsiness
which hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing and vertex waves. Photic stimulation
produces scant driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal neuroepileptiform features are observed. The
hypersynchronous slowing is a normal finding in drowsiness.
