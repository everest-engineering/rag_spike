CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 21-year-old male with a single seizure in eighth grade, generalized tonic clonic seizure with loss of consciousness, not requiring medications.  The patient is hoping to obtain a driver's license.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  The patient seemed to be very nervous in the initial section of the EEG with frequent eye blink.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by a prominent increase in background theta.  Hyperventilation also seems to produce some theta.  The initial sections of the EEG suggest that the patient may have been subtly hyperventilating in the initial sections of the record and later sections of the record do not have that same hyperventilation pattern with an increase in theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Head rocking was noted in the posterior scalp electrodes.  The patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation.  A scant driving response was noted.

Heart rate 84 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and sleep. The initial EEG pattern likely represents hyperventilation phenomena particularly because when the technologist asked the patient to count backwards from 10 the patient seemed to calm down and the EEG was a normal awake adult pattern and the rapid eye blink resolved.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified on this EEG.
