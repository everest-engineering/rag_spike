History:	93 year old woman who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient very rapidly transitions to stage II sleep.
Frequent polymorphic theta and delta activity is captured over the left anterior temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an
irregular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, moderate, left temporal, anterior
Sleep, stage 2
No epileptiform discharges
Cardiac arrhythmia
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to frequent moderate focal slowing
in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this
region.  Rapid transitions to sleep indicate an excessively drowsy/ sleep deprived patient.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate.
