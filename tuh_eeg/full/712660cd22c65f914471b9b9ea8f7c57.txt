CLINICAL HISTORY: 72 year old woman with aphasia, change in mental status, MCA
infarct, dementia, panic, other medical problems.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Zyprexa, Risperdal, Fibercon, Furosemide. Motrin,
Acidophilus
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is a high amplitude,
disorganized, somewhat chaotic-appearing record. There is a great deal of muscle
movement artifact. There are sharp waves at noted F7 and at T4. There is also some
focal slowing and more significant sharp waves in the right mid and anterior temporal
region. Muscle artifact is problematic in the frontal regions. The overall background is
slow. Photic stimulation does not activate record.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Absence of the normal morphologies for an adult of this age.
3. Sharp waves primarily right mid temporal but sometimes left anterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the study done the previous
day. There is no quite as much in the way of epileptiform activity. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a consideration for a longer term recording to capture her
events is suggested.
