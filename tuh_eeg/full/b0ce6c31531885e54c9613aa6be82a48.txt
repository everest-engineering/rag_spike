History:	59 YR FEMALE CC OF MEMORY PROBLEM FOUND TO HAVE  NEURO SYPHILIS
4-5 YRS AGO.  THEN STARTED HAVING SZS 1-2 YR.  LAST SZ 2014  USUALLY
WHEN FORGETS MEDS. FEEL TIRED,  FALL/LOC POST TIRED.
Medications:	KEPPRA, CLONAZEPAM, LISINOPRIL, LEXAPRO
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  As drowsiness progresses,
symmetric vertex waves appear.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage
2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.  Heart rate is 66.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, marked diffuse
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
