CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed female with episodes of deja vu.


MEDICATIONS: Effexor, Propranolol, Ortho Tri-Cyclen


INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system  of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation  are performed. Although, this was requested with olfactory stimulation there is no  evidence that olfactory stimulation was performed.  This is a 1 hour EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 10 Hz, symmetric reactive alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, vertex waves, K complexes, spindles. The patient starts to transition into slow wave sleep with bursts of
2 Hz delta activity. Photic stimulation is performed following the sleep record. The patient is still asleep during photic stimulation. Hyperventilation does not significantly alter the record.

HR:	72 bpm


IMPRESSION:  Normal  EEG.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  Unfortunately, the testing that was requested was not performed for this individual.
