History:	70 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O LT ARM/LEG WEAKNESS X 2 DAYS.
ISCHEMIC STROKE W/O THROMBOLYSIS. PMHX SIG FOR HTN, HLD, PE, RT
CEA 7/2009, TIA, MI AND A-FIB.
Medications:	HEPARIN, KEPPRA, METOPROLOL, ASPIRIN, PROTONIX, ZOCOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Nearly continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the right anterior temporal region (F8/T4).
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There was continuous 60Hz artifact in
the EEG. Notch filter was used.  HR 72. Some PVCs were noted.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, nearly continuous, right temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in
The right anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in
this region, likely structural in origin.
