History:	41YR MALE FOLLOW UP EEG.  PT PRESENTED WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS.
Medications:	KEPPRA, PHENOBARBITAL, HEPARIN, AMLODIPINE, METOPROLOL,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates and its seen
best on the right.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, best seen on the right frontal
regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left central region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  There is a loss of faster frequencies over that region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR 102
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left central
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing  and loss of
faster frequencies in the left central region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral
cortical dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.
