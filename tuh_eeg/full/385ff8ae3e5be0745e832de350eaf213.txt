History:	46 YR OLD FEMALE WITH CC OF SEIZURES AND MIGRAINES.FOLLOW UP EEG.
PMHX: SZS SINCE CHILD AND HEART VALUE REPLACEMENT SURGERY 12/14,
LAST SZ W/ LOC AND POSTICTAL CONFUSION X 2 WEEKS AGO.
Medications:	KEPPRA 2000MG A DAY
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the anterior temporal  region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
