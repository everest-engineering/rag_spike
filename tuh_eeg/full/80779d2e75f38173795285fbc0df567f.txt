History:	22 year old woman with a history of seizures.  Patient is currently 6 months pregnant.
Medications:	Trileptal, Zofran, (Patient stated on drugs for depression, but can not remember)
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is noted.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are
abundant.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the
No clear focal slowing is present.  No clear epileptiform discharges are present.  A single sharp
transient is noted over the left midtemporal region.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), prominent
Beta, excessive
Sleep, stage 2, abundant
Sharp transients, one, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 23-minute briefly awake and mostly asleep EEG. The presence of a single left
temporal sharp transient is of uncertain clinical significance.  Excessive beta activity could be
secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
