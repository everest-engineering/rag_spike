CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed woman with right sided shaking, tremor and past stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increasing beta and rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness. There are additional wave forms noted on the left with some underlying focal slowing. These are seen on the left and appear to be left mid temporal sharp waves, some of which are mid temporal, rarely anterior or posterotemporal. There is subtle and mixed in with some of the same normal variant left temporal 5 Hz activity, but there is some arrhythmic slowing as well as beta accentuation. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Because of the underlying normal variant, left temporal focal slowing with a normal variant would carry the same appearance. If there is any question about epilepsy versus a movement disorder a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep could be utilized.
