History:	48 YR OLD MALE WITH PMHX SIG SEIZURES,ASTHMA . SKULL DEFECT  ON LT
OCCIPITAL. NOW PRESENTS WITH UN WITNESSED SZ, PT CANT RECALL
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 6Hz posterior dominant rhythm, which
attenuates  with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Background activity is predominantly irregular, 6-7Hz activity, with poorly
formed anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by vertex waves.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left posterior quadrant, most pronounced at
T5 during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Background activity shows higher amplitude
over the left hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR 92
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic, continuous, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left posterior quadrant, T5
Breach artifact, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  intermittent focal slowing
in the left posterior quadrant.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  Breach artifact is consistent with the
