CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old woman with epilepsy since her teenage years.  She experiences 1-2 seizures per month, but none since January 12th.  They begin with staring followed by tonic-clonic activity, tongue biting and confusion.  Family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Celexa, Albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak is identified at eye closure.  Features of drowsiness including rhythmic central theta. Just prior to photic stimulation, the patient has a burst of sharply contoured 5 Hz activity, but that burst also seems to have frequency evolution.  Abundant discharges are noted asymptomatically in wakefulness of 4-6 Hz.  They occur in relaxed wakefulness and photic stimulation.  Assessment of these is somewhat complicated by quite frequent eye artifact. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmicity of the background.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Mu activity is noted which is a little better defined on the right than the left.
HR:  N/A
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
5 Hz theta activity on the left which has characteristics which are outside of the limits of normal for midtemporal theta of drowsiness in that it does appear to evolve.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings may be seen in localization-related epilepsy.  To more completely identify discharge and to more completely determine whether or not it is a normal variant or an epileptiform discharge, a sleep deprived or more prolonged sleep record is suggested.
