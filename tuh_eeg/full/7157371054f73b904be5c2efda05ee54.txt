REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 18-year-old woman with two generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system in addition to anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen independently at T5 and T6 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts.  This is slightly more prominent over the left T5 than T6.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to focal slowing in the bilateral posterotemporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral posterotemporal regions, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the excess beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.
