CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old woman with a change in mental status, syncope,
with a pacer in place. Evaluate for wound infection.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Zosyn, Baclofen. Diazepam, Senna, Thiamine, ASA

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
The patient seems to be very drowsy throughout the EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in maximum wakefulness
includes a 9 Hertz alpha rhythm but there is excess theta activity. There is some
shifting symmetry and a suggestion of a breech rhythm characterized by accentuation of
fast activity but more so in the left frontocentral region compared to the right. There is
some artifact at C3 and some of the vertex waves are also seen to be maximum off the
midline. Photic stimulation does not significantly activity the record.

84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Modest background slowing.
2. Mild disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging.
