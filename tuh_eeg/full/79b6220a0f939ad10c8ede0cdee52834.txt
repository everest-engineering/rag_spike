History:	PMH: HASHIMOTO ENCEPHALOPATHY WITH SZ, DIABETES, TRAUMA (MVA
2012), PREMATURE (5.5 MONTHS). PT HERE FOR FOLLOW UP EEG
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, that at best reaches 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present
throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows
to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal region and mild diffuse background slowing. These findings are indicative of focal
and diffuse cerebral dysfunction respectively and are etiologically non-specific.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
