History:	63 year old woman with events concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Topamax, Flexeril, Ativan, Lipitor, Sinequan, Lexapro, Ambien
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-10.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Subtle left anterior quadrant polymorphic theta and delta activity is present.  It becomes more
pronounced by the end of the recording.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Sleep, stage 2
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left anterior, subtle
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to subtle occasional mild-to-
moderate left anterior focal slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
