History:	UNKNOWN MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O FOUND DOWN UNRESPONSIVE, KNOWN
HX OF SZ AND DRUG ABUSE. COCAINE AND CANNABIS. PT ALSO NOTED WITH
SKULL DEFECT.
Medications:	PROPOFOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left frontotemporal and midtemporal  region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  Occasional spike-and-wave discharges are
present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum atF7 with a larger field at FP1.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There is no change in the background
activity to visual, auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Spikes, occasional, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of occasional epileptiform discharges and intermittent focal
slowing in the left frontotemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic focus in this region and focal cerebral dysfunction, the latter being non-specific with
regards to etiology. In addition there is moderate to severe  diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect.
