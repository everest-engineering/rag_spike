CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old left handed woman with hypothyroidism, depression, weight loss, and rapidly progressive memory loss.
MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Synthroid, Ritalin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is slow and disorganized with excess background theta.  There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There are bursts of rhythmic frontal delta as well as bursts of shifting arrhythmic delta activity.  There is a slight underlying asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity on the left in comparison to the right.
Heart rate: 60-90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due,
Background slowing and disorganization with a sharply contoured  background.
Prominent shifting, slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted in this record.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not obtained, nor was sleep.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing sleep is suggested.  A repeat study may also be of value to assess progression of this syndrome.
