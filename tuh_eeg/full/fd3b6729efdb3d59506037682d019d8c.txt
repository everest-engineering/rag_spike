History:	69 YR MALE S/P DLT 3/13. CC OF HYPOXEMIA RESP FAILURE, RENAL FAILURE, PROGRAF TOXICITY,  PMHX: TX, AFIB, HYPOTHYROID, AFIB, HLD, CARD, GERD.  CT. NONSPEC DEMYL OF FRONTAL LOBES, UNCHANGED.
Medications:	NO SEDATION, NO PAIN MEDS'
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present. No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66 some PVCs  Technical difficulties: Continuous movement and muscle artifact seen.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL limited EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
