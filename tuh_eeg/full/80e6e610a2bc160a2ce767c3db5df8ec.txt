Medications:	LAMICTAL, DEPAKOTE, LEXAPRO, RISPERIDONE
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
There is focal slowing in the left and right fronto-temporal region independently.  Frequent focal
sharp waves, spikes and polyspikes present with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at F7, FP1,
T5 and independently at F8/T4.  Some of the left frontotemporal sharps have a large field that
spreads prefrontally and more frontal.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, bilateral frontotemporal
Sharp waves, bilateral (L>R) frontotemporal
Polyspikes, right frontotemporal
Sharp waves, left frontal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of frequent epileptiform discharges
in the bilateral fronto-temporal and left posterior temporal region.  These findings are indicative of
a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are
consistent with a diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with multiple possible epileptogenic foci.
