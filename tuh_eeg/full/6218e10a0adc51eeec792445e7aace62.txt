CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old woman with hypertension, hepatitis C, and drug abuse admitted to the hospital with new onset seizures with shaking all over and looking to the left on an unknown date.  Massive right hemispheric hemorrhage with left ventriculostomy and EVD on the left.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, lisinopril, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bed side in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:
The background EEG is markedly abnormal.  There is an intrahemispheric asymmetry superimposed upon a diffusely slow record.  The activity is a mixture of primarily delta and theta on the right. On the left, there are bursts of beta.
Stimulation of the patient produces some faster activity, more so on the left than the right.
Breach rhythm is noted with an accentuation of faster frequency activity on the left frontal central region.
Heart rate 90 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
A marked asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.
A markedly slow background with intermittent attenuations, which are a bit more prominent on the right.
A slow pattern on the left but with some evidence of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm identified on the left may be due to this patient's skull defect. The activity is markedly slow on the right in the region of the hemorrhage.  No seizures were recorded, and there were no specific epileptiform features.
