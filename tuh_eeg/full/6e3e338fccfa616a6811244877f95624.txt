History:	46 YO FEMALE SYNCOPE VS SEIZURE. SEVERAL MONTHS OF SPELLS IN
WHICH SHE STARTS OUT WITH BEING LIGHTHEADED/VERTIGO. LOSES ALL
ENERGY. LAYS DOWN FOR 5-6 MIN. SHE DOES RECALL ALL EVENTS. -
Medications:	MULTI- VIT
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  a single sharp transient was present at T3.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, left temporal, mid
Sharp transients, single, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing a single sharp
transient in the left midtemporal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially
epileptogenic area of focal cerebral dysfunction in the region.
