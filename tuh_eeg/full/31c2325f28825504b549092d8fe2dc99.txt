EEG:
CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old right handed gymnast with recurrent, mild to
moderate concussions, but with post concussive syndrome with nausea, photophobia,
occasional tinnitus, impaired memory.
MEDICATIONS: Elavil, Zofran, Motrin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9.3 Hz alpha
rhythm. There is a small amount of theta in the background of approximately 6 Hz and
a smaller amount of 8.3 Hz activity noted in the background. Brief drowsiness is
characterized by hypersynchronous slowing. Hyperventilation also produces some
hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 64 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Scant background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. The
background theta described above is nonspecific. It has been reported in post
concussive syndrome, but it can also be seen in association with the use of
amitriptyline.
