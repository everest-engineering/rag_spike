CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with possible epilepsy, medication nonadherence, poorly controlled diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Stelazine, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat poorly organized.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with frontal central beta and a small amount of theta.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record producing shifting slowing.  Vertex waves were noted in sleep.  Posts were also observed.
By the end of the record, when the patient was stimulated for photic stimulation, the EEG was a bit better organized.  A driving response was noted at intermittent flash frequencies.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Mild background disorganization.
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG without epileptiform features for this adult.  Background slowing and disorganization may be related to this patient's comorbidities.
