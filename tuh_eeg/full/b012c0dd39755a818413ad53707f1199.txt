FOR SDH S/P CRANI ON 9/8/14 RT FRONTAL CENT AREA
Medications:	ASPIRIN, LOVENOX, LIPITOR, LOPRESSOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right fronto temporal region during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  There is an associated loss of faster frequencies over
that region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal, associated loss of faster frequencies.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the right
fronto temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in this region.
