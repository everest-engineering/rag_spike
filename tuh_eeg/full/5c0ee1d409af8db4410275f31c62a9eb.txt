CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old right handed man presents with frequent intractable seizures and history of head trauma.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, famotidine, Tegretol.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage 1.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, do not produce any abnormal discharges.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and F8/T4, as well as some infrequent F3 sharp waves and 1 single T5 sharp wave.
2. Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F3 and F4 independently at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
3. Bursts of generalized slow waves seen intermittently throughout the recording at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Multiple spikes seen in bilateral anterior temporal lobes, left frontal lobe and left posterior temporal region, in addition to right frontal.
2. Generalized slow waves.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either anterior temporal region or left temporal lobe, as well as left frontal region.  There is also evidence of bifrontal cerebral dysfunction, as well as generalized dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be seen due to underlying white matter disease.  No seizures were seen.
