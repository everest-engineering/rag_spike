History:
Medications: Sedation: EEG Type: Technique:
58 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O RT LEG NUMBNESS FOR 30 MIN. PT HAD EPISODE OF LOC AND SHAKING. ADMIT WITH DX OF TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK
KEPPRA
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  Frequent RMTD is seen.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present independently in the bilateral anterior temporal region during wakefulness and drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. Hr was 84
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal,anterior
interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonÂ­ specific.
