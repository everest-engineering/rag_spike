MEDICINES:  Fentanyl, insulin, metoprolol, and antibiotics.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old woman, status post large left MCA infarct, bilateral infarcts, now with new infarct and encephalopathy.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record for a patient, who was at times uncomfortable.
There is a fair amount of muscle noted primarily from the right in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is better developed on the right and disrupted on the left.  Throughout much of the record, there is more muscle on the right in comparison to the left.  In wakefulness, there are intermittent brief bursts of rhythmic frontal delta, which are more prominent in the left hemisphere compared to the right.  As the patient relaxes, there is a more well-defined asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity in the left hemisphere relative to the right.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Heart rate:  126 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
3.     Focal slowing on the left
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen.  The focal features noted on the  left are congruent with the prior stroke. FIRDA and generalized slowing support a metabolic encephalopathy.
