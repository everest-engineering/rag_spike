CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old right-handed gentleman with hepatitis C, hypertension, diabetes, and 2 episodes in which the patient had spells, where he "felt something come over him, had a loss of consciousness, and crawled to his bedroom."  The patient recalls sweating at that time.
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol, atorvastatin, and lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  A 22-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage, 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm which is present and reactive to eye opening.  There is generous, low voltage frontocentral beta and scant background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness and an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation elicited occasional theta.
Heart rate: 78 BPM
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due:
Mild excess beta.
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The excess theta and theta may be correlated with this patient's clinical history and/or medications.
