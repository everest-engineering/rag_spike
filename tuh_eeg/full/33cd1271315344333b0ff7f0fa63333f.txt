Referring MD:		Technologist:
History:	53 year old man who presents with a seizure and change in MS.
Medications:	Fentanyl, Versed, Insulin, Potassium, lovenox, Famotidine
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Patient remains asleep throughout the majority of the recording.  Sleep is
characterized by periods of discontinuity an a mixture of polymorphic theta, delta and diffuse sleep-
No focal slowing is present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 23-minute awake and mostly asleep EEG because of diffuse background
slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, that at least partially is related to the medication effect.
