History:	70 YO MAN WITNESSED SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PT HAD CPR IN FIELD,
ASYSTOLE PEA CODE 3 ROUNDS. PMHX: COPD, WT LOSS
Medications:	DILANTIN X2, LORAZEPAM X 3, FENTANYL, PROTONIX.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse almost
completely attenuated activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Frontal and central predominant generalized periodic epileptiform
discharges (GPED's) are present, with a repetition rate of 0.5-1 Hz.  There is an associated body jerk
at times a long with each GPED consistent with Myoclomis.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), continuous generalized
Attenuation, continuous, marked diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  GPEDs and marked background attenuation. These
findings are indicative of a marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction and irritation. This findings along
with the myoclonus in the setting of post hypoxic injury are suggestive of a poor prognosis.
