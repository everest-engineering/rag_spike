History:	67 year old woman with history of dementia and seizures.  She has been seizure-
free for ~ 4 years.
Medications:	Aricept, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 6-7 Hz theta activity.
There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower
amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves
(FIRDA) occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  During
drowsiness, there is increase in the amount of FIRDA and diffuse theta.
No focal slowing is present.  Several independent right midtemporal and right parietal sharp waves
with aftergoing slow waves are noted.  Phase reversal occurs over T4 and P4 electrodes,
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild-to-moderate
Sharp waves, few, right, independent T4 and P4 sharp waves
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG due to mild-to-moderate diffuse slowing,
several independent right mid-temporal and right parietal epileptiform discharges. Diffuse slowing
is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
There is a potential epileptogenic focus in the right mid-temporal-parietal region.  FIRDA could be
seen in various forms of encephalopathy, increased ICP, bilateral deep white matter lesions.
