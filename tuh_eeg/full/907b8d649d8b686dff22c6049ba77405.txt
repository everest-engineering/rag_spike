CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed man with CAD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, CABG in 2000, presents with shortness of breath and hemoptysis, noted to have seizure activity after Narcan.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Midazolam, Phytonadione, Lasix.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens up to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz and does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontal central beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, and in this patient may be at least due in part to medication affect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
