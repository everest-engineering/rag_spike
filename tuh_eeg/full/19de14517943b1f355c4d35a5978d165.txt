No current facility-administered medications for this visit. SEDATION: None
TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.
Events were marked by the clinical staff. All clinical events as well as extensive random background samples including wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep were reviewed.
DAY 1 (11/24/2015, 1O:OOPM - 11/30/2015, 06:00) BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by diffuse low to medium
amplitude 2-3 Hz delta activity which is more prominent over the left hemisphere.	There is intermittent beta activity which is also more prominent over the left frontal region.
Posterior dominant rhythm was not present.
The background is reactive, variable, but slow.
There was a persistent asymmetry in amplitude and frequency with the left hemisphere showing higher amplitudes and faster frequency activity throughout the recording.
Sleep was only rarely seen with asymmetric sleep spindles L>R and diffuse slowing.
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected DAY 1 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION:
Diffuse bihemispheric/bilateral delta slowing, maximal over the
left frontal region with relative suppression of the right hemisphere. No clinical or electrographic seizures were seen. These finding suggest a toxic-metabolic process, a post-ictal state, or diffuse underlying brain injury, greater on the left. Alternatively, the right hemisphere suppression could also suggest an acute brain injury. Clinical correlation is suggested. These findings were communicated to the primary team.
DAY 2 (11/25/2015, 06:00 - 11/26/2015 , 06:00)
BACKGROUND: No change GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) : None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single EKG lead captured normal sinus rhythm.
DAY 2 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Diffuse bihemispheric/bilateral delta slowing, maximal over the left frontal region with relative suppression of the right hemisphere. No clinical or electrographic seizures were seen. These finding suggest a toxic-metabolic process, a post-ictal state, or diffuse underlying brain injury, greater on the left. Alternatively, the right hemisphere suppression could also suggest an acute brain injury. Clinical correlation is suggested. These findings were communicated to the primary team.
DAY 3 (11/26/2015, 06:00 - 11/26/2015, 12:00PM)
BACKGROUND: No change GENERALIZED SLOWING: No change
FOCAL SLOWING: No change
PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM): None SPORADIC EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: None
EVENTS: No clinical or electrographic events reported or detected EKG: A single EKG lead captured normal sinus rhythm.
DAY 3 IMPRESSION & CLINICAL CORRELATION
Diffuse bihemispheric/bilateral delta slowing, maximal over the left frontal region with relative suppression of the right hemisphere. No clinical or electrographic seizures were seen.
These finding suggest a toxic-metabolic process, a post-ictal state, or diffuse underlying brain injury, greater on the left. Alternatively, the right hemisphere suppression could also suggest an acute brain injury. Clinical correlation is suggested. These findings were communicated to the primary team.
