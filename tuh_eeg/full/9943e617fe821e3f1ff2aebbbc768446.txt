LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Approximately 1 hour.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 21-year-old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 8.  Last seizure occurred approximately 1 year ago.  Seizures are characterized by generalized shaking and post ictal confusion.  The patient is currently 4 months pregnant.
MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 11.5 to 12 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is fast alpha variant that is occasionally observed.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 1-hour EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges in a  routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
