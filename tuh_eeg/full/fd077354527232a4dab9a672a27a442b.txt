History:	79 YO MALE PRESENTED TO EPEP IN PEA CODE ARREST.. PT COLLAPSED
FROM STANDING POSITION. PT HAD 3X BICAEB. PLUS SHOCK FOR ARREST.
PMHX: LUNG MSDS, COPD, HTN, R LUNG C, GLAUCOMA
Medications:	LORAZEPAM, HEPARIN, ALBUTEROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present
throughout the recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No
normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  Independent, bilateral occipital periodic epileptiform discharges, more
pronounced on the right with no evolution or electrographic seizures.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  ICU and EMG artifact were noted
throughout the recording.  HR 100
Summary of Findings:
PEDs (periodic epileptiform discharges), bilateral (R>L) occipital
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked, bilateral generalized
Triphasic waves, intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and triphasic waves.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Periodic
epileptiform discharges in the bi-occipital regions are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic
focus in this region, and given the clinical history of partial seizures, are consistent with a diagnosis
of localization-related epilepsy.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
