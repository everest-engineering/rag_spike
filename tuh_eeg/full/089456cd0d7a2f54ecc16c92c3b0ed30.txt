CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman with a history of refractory epilepsy, long-standing use of carbamazepine and Xanax, now with insomnia, early morning vertigo, and a seizure this morning
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Thirty-minute digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was seem to be tense, could not participate in hyperventilation and could not fall asleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  When the patient is cooperative, the EEG demonstrates an interhemispheric asymmetry.  There is a 7.5 to 8 Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left.  It is slower and disrupted on the right.  In addition, the right hemisphere has disruption of faster frequency activity, and a bit more arrhythmic delta activity.  Although, there is EKG artifact on the right, there are occasional sharp waves noted at T2-T4.  The patient was restless throughout the EEG and moving about.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 114 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is the 3rd EEG for this individual in the last 14 years.  The right focal slowing and sharp waves were previously identified in a 2011 study.  In addition, the focal and generalized slowing were also seen at that time.
These findings support a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
