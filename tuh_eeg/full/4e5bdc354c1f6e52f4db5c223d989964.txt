CLINICAL HISTORY:  Stroke in 2006 with development of daily shaking spells, left hemiparesis, intermittent episodes of numbness below the neck, currently in rehab.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol 200 mg per daily, Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous video EEG monitoring was performed in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient had no clinical seizures.  He frequently asked the EEG monitoring staff about going home with them, expressed reluctance to return to his inpatient rehabilitation program.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  In drowsiness, focal slowing emerges from the right hemisphere, particularly frontocentral and frontotemporal.  Vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS are noted in stage II sleep.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This prolonged, continuous video EEG monitoring session was remarkable for:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Push button events without epileptiform correlates.
A typical event for the patient for which he had an aura with body movements and rocking from side-to-side.  Although there was significant EEG artifact, there were no epileptiform features.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The focal features are congruent with a past stroke.  The clinical events recorded were without an EEG signature.  The video correlates were highly suggestive of an emotionally linked event such as a nonepileptiform seizure.  These findings were discussed with the patient.
