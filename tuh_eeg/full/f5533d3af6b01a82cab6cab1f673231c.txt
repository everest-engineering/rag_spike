CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 35-year-old male with a history of head trauma associated with an MVA in 1997 and subsequent development of epilepsy.  Currently, seizure-free for 12 years, but 1 month ago had a tonic clonic seizure with confusion.  Past history of a skull fracture 3 years ago.

MEDICATIONS:  Zantac.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory EEG, although impedances were slightly elevated in the T1 and T2 electrodes.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in theta.

Hyperventilation produced a small amount of slowing, but the patient seemed to be falling asleep during hyperventilation.

On 2 occasions in drowsiness, there was subtle underlying slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly frontotemporal regions with a mixture of 3-5 Hz activity.  These were brief bursts, not sustained.  Subtle photic driving was noted.

Heart rate 60 BPM.

IMPRESSION:  This is a subtly abnormal EEG due to:
Infrequent, subtle focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly frontocentral or frontotemporal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No mention of a breach rhythm was noted.  The subtle focal slowing may be correlated with imaging.  There were no epileptiform features.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
