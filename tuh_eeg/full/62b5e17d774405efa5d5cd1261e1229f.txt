CLINICAL HISTORY:  80 year old woman with new right sided stroke, status post PE code on December 18, 2011, anoxic respiratory failure.  Evaluate for delirium.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Amiodarone, Prednisone, Methotrexate, Zoloft, Plavix, Evista, Folic Acid, Ranitidine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low voltage, slow with a mixture of delta and theta.  There are intermittent, brief attenuations noted in the record.
When unstimulated the record becomes a bit more suppressed.  With stimulation there is a bit more theta.
HR:   120 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement or normal background with an intermittently discontinuous pattern.
Slow and suppressed pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  This EEG is compatible with a severe anoxic injury.
