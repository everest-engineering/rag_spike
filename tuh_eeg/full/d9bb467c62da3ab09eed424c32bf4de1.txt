CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old gentleman who was the victim of a car accident in 1980 or
1990, left with severe chronic static encephalopathy, seizure brief or tenuous until a seizure
some months ago. After the seizure, the patient was significantly debilitated but is now basically
back to baseline. Keppra was added at that time ..

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Amlodipine, Metoprolol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized.
There is prominent beta and excess theta. The posterior dominant rhythm ranges from 7 to 8
Hz. There is an amplitude asymmetry with somewhat higher activity on the right compared to
the left. There is also a little bit more arrhythmic delta activity on the left and occasional sharply
contoured slowing at T3 or C3. There is also some focal slowing identified at C4. Photic
stimulation does not significantly activate the record .


Abnormal EEG due to:

1.
Background slowing and disorganization.
2.
Superimposed focal slowing with a somewhat slower pattern on the left compared to the
right.
3.
A handful of sharp waves in the left hemisphere including central and temporal region.
4.
Amplitude accentuation in the right central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance. The activity is
slower on the left which may be correlated with imaging.
