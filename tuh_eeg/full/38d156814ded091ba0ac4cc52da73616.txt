History:	62 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX OF CVA (TOXEMIA PREG). WITH APHASIA AND
RIGHT WEAKNESS.  SUBSEQUENTLY SZS. SZ FREE FOR YRS. NO MEDS.  NOW
WITH CC OF RIGHT UE TREMOR. WHICH WAS SIMILAR TO PAST SZS. EVAL54
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent focal slowing is present in the left frontotemporal region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
left frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically non-specific.
