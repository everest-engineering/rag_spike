CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old woman with seizure on November 22nd, the patient hit her head on the side of the door requiring stitches.  No recent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Naprosyn, Lipitor, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  One-hour routine digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record with impedances under 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 10.5 hertz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by slowing of the background with slowing of the alpha rhythm.  A handful of asynchronous bursts were noted as the patient transitioned in and out of stage 1 sleep.  This 1-hour EEG, the patient transitions frequently in and out of stage I sleep and does not seem to be able to sustain stage I sleep, although she does not seem to be having snore artifact.  The tech encourages the patient to relax, but is unable to sustain a sleep state.  Cognitive testing was performed.  The patient struggles with some of the responses.
Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 1-hour video EEG is remarkable for some shifting and slowing in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the 2nd EEG without epileptiform activity.  The shifting and slowing noted in sleep is a nonspecific finding, it is not uncommon in older adults, although this patient is under the age of 65.  It can be seen in underlying cerebrovascular disease.
