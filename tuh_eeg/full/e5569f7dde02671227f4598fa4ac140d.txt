History:	60 YO RIGHT HANDED MALE, DX.WITH SEIZURE DISORDER, POST STROKE
EPILEPSY
Medications:	LOVENOX, HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, VALSARTAN, LASIX, COREG, NORVASC,
ASA 81, FERROUS SULFATE, HUMOLOG INSULIN, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a PDR that at best reaches 8Hz, which is best seen on the
right hemisphere and attenuates with eye opening.  5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is only present over
right hemisphere region.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite
prolonged clinical sleep.
Nearly continuous rhythmic delta activity is present in the F7/T1 region during wakefulness and
drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F8/T2 region during
wakefulness and drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Focal slowing, rhythmic, nearly continuous, left frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of nearly continuous focal slowing in the left frontotemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of severe focal cerebral dysfunction in this region, which is
consistent with the known stroke.  In addition there is evidence of  intermittent focal slowing in the
right frontotemporal region and diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of focal
and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
