CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old woman with a history of seizures after age 16 after she fell down the stairs; dementia, alcohol abuse, epilepsy, and depression. Please evaluate for tremor.

MEDICATIONS: Celexa, Keppra, Ibuprofen, Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a slight asymmetry with a bit more 6 to 7 Hz theta activity noted more in the right hemisphere than the left. Tremor is not observed, although the patient is not specifically tested for tremor. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. A small asymmetry with a very small amount of theta on the right compared to the left

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging. There was no  epileptiform activity observed.
