REASON FOR STUDY:  Prolonged convulsive status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  85-year-old woman with a history of left MCA stroke and t-PA in August of 2012, hypertension, hypothyroidism that presents with prolonged convulsive status.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous muscle artifact throughout the temporalis and central region of the head.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is an absence of normal brain activity and there is an overlying muscle artifact throughout the recording.  There appears to be no variability or reactivity to the EEG and overall there is a low amplitude slowing seen throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slowing at 1-3 Hz and an amplitude of less than 10 microvolts seen continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  114, irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to marked to severe generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
