CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed woman with asthma, dementia, bipolar disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer disease, evaluate for myoclonic jerks and change in mental status.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Haldol, Benztropine, Lamictal, Zyprexa, Hydroxyzine

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation nor photic stimulation was not performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of theta and delta.  There is some posteriorly predominant delta and with at times a positivity and at other times a negativity at 01. This is seen when the patient is awake.  Occasional muscle twitch is noted in the background.  The muscle twitch is not associated with an EEG correlate.

HR:    66 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. A subtle, underlying area of delta in the posterior regions present bilaterally with some shifting asymmetry.
3. Pseudo periodic bursts of posterior periodic delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study to capture spells may be of use.  Given the posteriorly predominant slowing, additional imaging or clinical evaluation may be warranted.
