CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed male with tonic-clonic seizure, alcohol abuse, alcohol withdrawal seizure versus new onset epilepsy. New onset tonic-clonic seizures followed by postictal lethargy.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is a relatively drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. The patient is described as quite tense during the EEG. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background. Hyperventilation produces movement artifact. Photic stimulation is obscured by muscle artifact
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this record. There is a great deal of muscle artifact consequently, a followup study capturing sleep is suggested.
