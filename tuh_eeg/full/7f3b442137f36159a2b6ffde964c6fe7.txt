History:	20 YR OLD MALE FOUND DOWN AFTER REPORTED NIGHT OF ETOH
CONSUMPTION FOUND BY EMS W BLOODY NOSE AND PULSELESS.PT
RECEIVED 2 DOSES EPI FOR PEA ARREST AND WAS INTUBATED IN THE
FIELD.PT WAS MADE A TRAUMA UPON ARRIVAL TO ED AND HAD NEGATIVE
TRAUMA EVALUATE.1-20
Medications:	N/A
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse very
low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  This voltage decrease is a marked difference compared to the previous EEG.  Diffuse,
frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording.
These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag.  No normal sleep architecture was
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 120
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Triphasic waves
Low voltage
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent frontally-maximal triphasic waves and severe
diffuse background slowing.  These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy,
which is etiologically nonspecific, but may be seen in hypoxic injury.  Please note that this EEG
has a marked difference from yesterday with a lower amplitude seen today.
