LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  20 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 69-year-old man with a questionable seizure.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Unasyn, midazolam and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed at the patient's bedside. The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is weak and at times, absent.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude, theta and delta and occasional alpha.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate generalized slowing.
Poor organization.
No epileptiform discharges.
No sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 20 minute electroencephalogram due to mild to moderate diffuse background slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
