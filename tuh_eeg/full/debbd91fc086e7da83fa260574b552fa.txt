REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 24-week-old gestational age and 28-week-old conceptional age baby girl with a grade 4 intraventricular hemorrhage and seizures extubated on 03/23, with EEG to evaluate for seizures.

MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, caffeine.

INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with EMG, EOG and EKG as well as respiratory electrodes.  The patient was recorded during active and quiet sleep as well as awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.

Technical difficulties:  None.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG is consistent with indeterminate sleep with mainly bursts of mixed frequency moderate high to mid amplitude activity seen mostly in the posterior head regions, which is discontinuous and with intermittent periods of nearly flat background lasting at times up to 30 seconds consistent with trace discontinue.  There are delta brushes seen over the temporal and occipital regions, some scattered left mid temporal and central sharp waves seen, and some rhythmic 3 Hz activity and some occipital delta seen intermittently.  This pattern is seen throughout the recording and at times there appear to be some encoches frontales.

Abnormal discharges:  At times there appears to be excessive discontinuity seen in between the bursts lasting almost 30 seconds.

Seizures:  None.

Heart rate:  150.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to excessive discontinuity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals mild excessive discontinuity which may indicate diffuse cerebral injury or immaturity.  No other clear seizures or epileptiform sharp wave focus were seen during this recording.  Otherwise, the patterns seen on this EEG are fairly typical for the patient's conceptional age.
