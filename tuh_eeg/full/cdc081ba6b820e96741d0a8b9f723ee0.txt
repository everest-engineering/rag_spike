CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old female lung transplant patient  now with tremor.
MEDICATIONS: Cefepime, Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Methylprednisolone, Basiliximab, Heparin, Flagyl,  Lorazepam, Caspofungin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system  of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is in double  isolation and the technologist is in an isolation costume during  the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an abnormal pattern  with background slowing. The overall pattern is a mixture  of 2 Hz delta and 4-5
Hz activity. A tremor  monitor  is utilized  demonstrating tremor  on the EMG lead, but this is without  a scalp EEG correlate.
HR:   60-90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Markedly background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed. This patient's background slowing must be interpreted clinically, particularly if sedative hypnotic medications are utilized in this acute care setting.
