CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old woman with episodes of leg shaking and unresponsiveness.  Bipolar disease and depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient appears to be tense.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE  RECORD:  The background EEG includes an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with muscle artifact and beta.   Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:   60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The beta and the muscle artifact can be observed in an individual receiving benzodiazepines or in an anxious person.  No epileptiform features were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper
stages of sleep may be appropriate.
