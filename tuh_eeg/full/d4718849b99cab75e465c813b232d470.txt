History:	HX OF SEIZURES FOR APPROX THE PAST 2 YRS. THIS IS THE 1ST EEG IN
THAT TIME.
Medications:	PHENYTOIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive diffuse symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present,
maximal over bilateral frontocentral regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces a minimal photic driving response.  HR is 78.
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast, continuous diffuse
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, asleep and briefly awake. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges
on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinically indicated, suggest
