History:	41 YO MALE WITH RECENT INCREASE OF EVENTS AFFECTING SPEECH,
WALKING AND BALANCE LASTING HOURS W/O LOC. PT CC OF SHORT TERM
MEMORY LOSS.
PMHX:  DIABETIC (DAILY INSULIN SHOT)
Medications:	Insulin
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 7-8Hz alpha rhythm at best, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present  and at
times with bifrontal 1-4Hz activity throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. mild diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
