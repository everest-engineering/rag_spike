CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed male with history of aneurysm removed in 2007 with increase in seizure frequency recently.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Carbamazepine.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an increase in the beta noticed on the right hemisphere.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T6 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts with an associated breach over that region.
In addition, there are generalized spike and wave bursts with a frontal predominance seen symmetrically over both hemispheres at a frequency of 4-4.5 Hz with an amplitude of 20-75 microvolts and bursts lasting no longer than 1.5 seconds.  The patient was tested during one of these bursts and appeared to be responsive.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spike and waves.
Focal slow waves in the right posterotemporal region with an associated breach rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right posterotemporal region, which is consistent with the known surgery in that region.  No seizures were seen.
