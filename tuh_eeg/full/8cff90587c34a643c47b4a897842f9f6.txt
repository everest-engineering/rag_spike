CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old, right-handed adult with 11 year history of epilepsy, 3-4 seizures per week, refractory to Depakote.  The patient reports no aura then passes out loss of consciousness.  Wakes up with saliva, may be shaking.  History of headaches with a feeling as if hot water on the head.  History of auditory hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Norvasc, metformin, and metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  One hour digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  There were no previous EEGs for comparison.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, there is a great deal of muscle artifact noted in the background.  There is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, as the patient starts to drift off to sleep, there is occasional, subtle, underlying focal slowing noted in the left or right temporal region.  It is a little more remarkable in left temporal region.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and produced bursts of rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation was obscured by muscle and chew artifact.
Heart rate:  90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Intermittent left or right temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No definitive sharp waves or spikes were noted.  The temporal features identified in drowsiness are nonspecific.  They demonstrate some of the characteristics seen as an age-related phenomenon, although this individual is less than 60 years of age.  In this one hour EEG, there were no epileptiform features.
Given the frequency of this patient's seizures, additional recording strategies may be employed.
