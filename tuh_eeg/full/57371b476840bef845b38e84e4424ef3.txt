LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Approximately 22 minutes.
ACTIVATING PROCEDURES:  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was done according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman who sustained a fall down the stairs.
MEDICATIONS:  No antiepileptic medications.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 9.5 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness there is an increase in diffuse theta as well as bursts of diffuse delta.  Stage 2 sleep is not recorded.  Hyperventilation does not produce a significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation results in appropriate bilateral symmetric occipital driving at multiple frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Normal posterior dominant rhythm.
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If a clinical indication for seizures still persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
