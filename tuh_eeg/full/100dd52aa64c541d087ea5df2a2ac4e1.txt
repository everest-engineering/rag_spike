:
History:	57 year old woman with a history of breast cancer, now presents with a seizure-like
Medications:	ARIMIDEX, CELEXA, BONIVA, LOPRESSOR
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and
subtemporal chain, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity
is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at flash multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a normal 41-minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but
stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may
provide additional information.
