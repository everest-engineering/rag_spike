History:	58 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF MIGRAINES.  PMHX: SZS (LAST 2013),
DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, DM, GERD, PANCREATITIS (2010),  HYPOTHYROID,
HLD.  FOLLOW UP EEG.
Medications:	TOPAMAX, FLEXERIL, ATIVAN, QUETIAPINE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was recorded
Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, left temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of occasional focal slowing in the left midtemporal
region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
