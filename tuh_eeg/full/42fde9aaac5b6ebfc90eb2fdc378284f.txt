History:	84 YR OLD MAN FOLLOW UP EEG. PT  H/O SDH (CRANIOTOMY)  MI. CHANGE IN
MS (LTM 11/14).  PT STATES THEN HE WAS HALLUCINATING.  HE SAY NOW
SOMETIMES WHEN IN CROWD EVERYONE WILL LOOK ALIKE.  CT. ON NOV.
ADM. SHOWED HYPODENSITY IN RIGHT OCCIP.
Medications:	Lipitor, ASA, Lopressor
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During limited drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the right
midtemporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
