CLINICAL HISTORY:  67 year old right handed man with a history of hypertension, early stage dementia, alcohol and drug abuse, and a history of stroke, who presents with a history of stuttering, word-finding difficulties, confusion, and face twitching.

MEDICATIONS:  Procardia, Elavil, Thiamine.

REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is some continuous eye movement artifact during the recording.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best reaches 8.5 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, which produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and does not really reach sleep.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen frequently during wakefulness throughout the recording.

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
