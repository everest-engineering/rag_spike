CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old woman, status post CABG on October 8th, status post cardiac arrest for 1 hour, evaluate for anoxic encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, magnesium, and fentanyl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, burst suppression pattern.  Periods of suppression are 3-5 seconds in duration with cerebral activity are 1-3 seconds.  There is some asynchrony in the burst suppression activity and there is a little bit more sharply contoured activity in the left hemisphere, particularly in the frontal regions.  There is also sometimes some fast activity noted in these bursts.
Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record and the record is relatively invariant, perhaps more stereotypic and in variant as the recording continues.
Heart rate 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern.
Absence of reactivity or variability.
An asymmetric pattern with a bit more cerebral activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG was performed with in the first 24 hours of cardiac arrest, but demonstrates worrisome prognostic finding.  Ongoing clinical monitoring and/or a repeat study may be a value.
