Medications:	GABAPENTIN,TOPROL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an alpha rhythm that at best reaches 7Hz, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular 4-7Hz
activity.  Some intermittent central beta can be seen.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of mild to moderate diffuse background slowing and slow
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.
