FOUND PULSELESS, APNEIC, ASYSTOLIC AT TUH. FAMILY REPORTS PT TAKING
HERBALIFE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. PMHX: HTN, SINGLE KIDNEY, LUMBAR
DISC DISEASE
Medications:	KEPPRA, VECURONIUM, HEPARIN, ACETAMINOPHEN, HUMULIN, KAYEXALATE,
SORBITOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (input, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 12 hours from 8PM on 02/15/2014 to 8AM on
02/16/2014.   Nursing-initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Graphical
representation of the EEG was available at the bedside for continuous review by EEG
technologists.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for
detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically detected events were
reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies and an overriding alpha discharge seen diffusely.  There is intermittent diffuse
attenuation seen.  There is definite variability in the background with some changes in the
amplitude and decrease in faster frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No electrographic seizures
were present.  Some intermittent sudden muscle artifact can be seen. No actual cerebral
electrographic correlate is seen with the muscle artifact.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No tests of reactivity (visual, auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli) are performed.  HR was 140's irregular. EKG electrode low amplitude.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, Some variability.
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 12 hours EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing and absent
alpha rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  The muscle jerks had no EEG correlate and are likely representative of subcortical
myoclonus.  No electrographic seizures are present.
