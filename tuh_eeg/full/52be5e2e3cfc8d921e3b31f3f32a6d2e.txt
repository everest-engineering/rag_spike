CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old male with new onset seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Keppra, Lacosamide, Coumadin, Hydralazine,  Aldactone, Famotidine, Lacosamide
. 	.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed in lab
using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel of EKG. No clinical seizures are noted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although there Is electrode artifact throughout much of the EEG, there is a periodic complex in the left occipital parietal region of approximately 50 microvolts. This periodic complex is starting to slow and is seen approximately every 2-3 seconds. It is also decreasing in amplitude and is now less than 50 microvolts. It is more prominent when the patient is asleep than awake.
HR:   60 bpm and Irregular
IMPRESSION: This EEG monitoring session is remarkable for:
1. 		Focal seizures from the left occipital region with a clinical correlate of right hemibody tremulousness.
2. 	Periodic complexes from the left occipital parietal region which are now significantly reduced at the end of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is diagnostic of a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. No seizures were recorded. The PLEDS from the left occipital parietal region are present but are much lower amplitude and are slowing in nature.
