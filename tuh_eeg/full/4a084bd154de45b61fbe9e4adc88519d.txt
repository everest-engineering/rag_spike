CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 19-year-old gentleman with mild mental retardation with childhood epilepsy now with episodes of shaking, chest discomfort, and right-sided shaking without loss of awareness.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote and Zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION: During this 24 hour section, this patient had multiple events with shaking or feeling anxious, but none of the episodes with simply right-sided motor shaking.
EVENT:  TIMES: 3:17, 15:12, 16:34, 19:33, and 19:44.
DESCRIPTION OF ALL EVENTS: The patient is awake.  When someone is there to test him, he is able to answer questions.  He occasionally reports tremulousness to the caregiver (tech/nurse).  No motor activity is noted by these caregivers and it is not possible to see with the resolution of the video.  Although there is some muscle artifact, there is no epileptiform activity associated with these symptoms.
RANDOM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a symmetric, reactive 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a fair amount of muscle in the background.  In stage II sleep, there are vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS.  There are occasional, subtle, right temporal sharp and slow wave complexes identified at T4 or T2. These are lower amplitude and less prominent than seen in the initial day of recording.  In the transition to stage III sleep, there is high amplitude 2 to 3 Hz delta activity, however, stage III sleep is not sustained.
HR: 70 BPM.
