CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult male with skull defect presenting in status epilepticus today. Name is unknown.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is intubated and wearing a hard collar.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the record begins, the background EEG is markedly slow with a mixture of delta and theta. A breach rhythm is noted on the right with higher amplitude activity on the right and some sharply contoured wave forms or sharp waves at F8 and T4. These are broadly contoured wave forms. As the recording continues, more rhythmic 5 Hz theta is noted in the right frontal region, but without frequency build up. There is some variability in terms of the amount of beta noted in the background. Stimulation of the patient does produce an increase in faster frequency activity.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Focal slowing from the right frontotemporal region.
Occasional simple right temporal sharp waves.
Rhythmic right frontal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded in this postictal patient. There is significant generalized background slowing, but this is a reactive EEG. Additional clinical evaluation may be warranted.
