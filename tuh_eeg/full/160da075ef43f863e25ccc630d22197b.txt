CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84 -year-old lady with a history of left MCA and right MCA stroke, atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism, who presents to the ED with complaints of left-sided headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Gabapentin, Advair, metoprolol and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  No activation procedures were performed as the patient was poorly cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximum wakefulness, the alpha rhythm on the left hemisphere is about 8.5 Hz in frequency.  The posterior dominant rhythm is disrupted on the right side.  The posterior dominant rhythm on the left side is also slow and disorganized.
There are frequent bursts of rhythmic delta activity in the right anterior temporal region of about 1 to 2 Hz in frequency and 50 to 70 microvolts in amplitude.  There is continuous slowing in the right anterior temporal region.  Occasional T3 simple sharp waves were noted.
Heart rate:  110 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
T3 sharp waves.
Focal slowing in the right anterior temporal region.
Bursts of rhythmic slowing in the right anterior temporal region.
Diffuse background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of underlying structural abnormality in the right anterior temporal region and also left anterior temporal region.  The sharp wave at T3 may represent a possible epileptogenic focus in that region.
These EEG findings are consistent with the known history of bilateral MCA territory strokes.
