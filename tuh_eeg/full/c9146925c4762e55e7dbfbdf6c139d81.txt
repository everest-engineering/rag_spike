CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with epilepsy for the last 3 years
which was initially attributed to polysubstance abuse, but had a stroke a year ago.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is a very drowsy individual.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is medium to low
amplitude. With stimulation, there is a 9.8 hertz alpha rhythm. The patient quickly drifts
off to sleep. He is falling asleep during photic stimulation. There is a slight asymmetry in the transition in and out of photic in that the alpha emerges a little bit faster on the left than the right and there is a little shifting asymmetry noted during photic stimulation. In addition, there is a slight driving response. Overall, there is a slightly disorganized background in relaxed wakefulness. There is subtle focal delta in the right hemisphere picked up on posterior temporal and central region as he transitions in and out of sleep.

HR: 90bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Moderate background slowing.
2. Shifting asymmetry including asymmetry in the alpha rhythm.
3. Subtle focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The special focal
features may be correlated with this patient's imaging. If epilepsy is an important
consideration, a followup study with prolonged sleep may be helpful to characterize
epileptiform activities.
