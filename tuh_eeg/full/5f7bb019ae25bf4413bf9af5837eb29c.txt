CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 45-year-old right-handed male with history of traumatic brain injury, status post craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma 2 months ago, and right frontal encephalomalacia.  Past history of schizophrenia, depressive disorder, and remote history of seizures.  The patient was incarcerated 1991 to February 2014.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, tramadol, and Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  A breach rhythm is noted with some head rocking artifact in the accentuation of beta activity at T3.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements with vertex waves, K complexes, and spindles noted in stage 2 sleep.  Notable in this record are the breach rhythm, asymmetric sleep morphology with vertex waves and spindles, slightly more prominent on the left.  In addition, despite EKG artifact and other artifacts, there are handful of discrete, T3 sharp waves noted, primarily in drowsiness or stage 2 sleep.  These can be differentiated from EKG artifact.
Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Left temporal focal slowing, subtle in the context of a breach.
Subtle left midtemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a focal or localization related mechanism for epilepsy.  No seizures were recorded.
