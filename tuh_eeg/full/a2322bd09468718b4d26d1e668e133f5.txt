History:	65 YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH FOLLOW UP EEG. DIAGNOSIS OF FOCAL
EPILEPSY AND EPILEPTIC SYNDROME WITH COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES
WITH INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY.
Medications:	Ibuprofen
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, at bests a 8 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric frontal alpha activity is present.  Excess diffuse
admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during
drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity
becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity seen independently in the bilateral fronto-temporal region
during wakefulness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
produces bifrontal bursts of eye fluttering artifact that did not persist and subsided with eye opening
and closing.  HR was 60. There is a continuous pacemaker artifact seen.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral frontotemporal
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, Excessive theta in wakefulness
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of intermittent independent focal slowing in the
bilateral frontotemporal regions and mild diffuse slowing.  These findings are indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction and mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction both of which are etiologically non-
specific.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
