History:	61 YR FEMALE WITH CC CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS.  WAX/WANE DELIRIUM,
DELUSIONS, ODD BEHAVIOR.  PMHX; COCAINE, HTN, DM.
Medications:	ACYCLOVIR, AMLODIPINE, LISINOPRIL, COREG, LIPITOR.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the
record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
