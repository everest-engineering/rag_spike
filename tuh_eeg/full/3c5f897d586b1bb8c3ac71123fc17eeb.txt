History:	75 year old man presents with episodes concerning for seizures.
Medications:	Keppra, Cyanocobalamin, Pravastatin, Trazodone, Prograf
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 8 Hz theta activity that attenuates with eyes open.  There is
an anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes
anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the theta rhythm rapidly attenuates, and diffuse delta> theta activity
Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates regular heart rate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right posterior, mild-to-moderate
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and focal
mild-to-moderate right posterior quadrant slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing is indicative of
focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  The
lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
