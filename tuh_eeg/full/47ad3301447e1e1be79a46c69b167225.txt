History:	20 year old man with anoxic brain injury (as a result of several gun shot wounds),
now with continuous facial twitching.
Medications:	Versed, Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
and EMG electrodes, comatose
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 29 hours from 04/28/2015 till 04/29/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All
automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  Early in the recording the background consists of a mixture of
theta and alpha activity, periods of discontinuity and bifrontal (left>right) sharp waves.  As the
recording progresses, sharp waves disappear.  Additionally, with stimulation, the background
attenuates significantly and slows down to the delta activity range.
There is nearly continuous C4, Fz, Cz and Pz lead artifact.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, bilateral frontal, resolve by the end of the recording
Other, clearly reactive background
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is a very abnormal continuous ~29 hour video EEG due to background slowing and bifrontal
epileptiform discharges seen in the first half of the recording. These findings are etiologically
nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction and increased bilateral cortical
excitability, especially over the bifrontal region.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
Clear background reactivity is present.  These findings were conveyed to the primary team.
