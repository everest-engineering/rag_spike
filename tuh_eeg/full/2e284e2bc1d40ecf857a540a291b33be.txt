REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of unresponsiveness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 70-year-old man with esophageal cancer status post stent and trach with an old left MCA stroke, COPD, hypertension and pneumonia, who presents with an episode of unresponsiveness resolved on March 22, concern for seizure versus hypoxic diffuse process.
MEDICATIONS:  Zosyn, insulin, isosorbide, aspirin, Coreg, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovenox, Protonix, Solu-Medrol, guaifenesin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included just photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz and it is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  78.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left mid temporal focal slowing in addition to mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
