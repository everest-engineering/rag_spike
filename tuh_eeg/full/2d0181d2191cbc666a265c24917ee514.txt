REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, heparin, ergocalciferol, Norvasc.
HISTORY:  A 63-year-old man presented with a history of syncope and a past medical history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes and hypertension.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening. There is no frontocentral beta.    Activating procedures accentuate a left temporal slowing which I will describe with the abnormal discharges but photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 mV seen intermittently throughout the recording.  Please note that this was accentuated during hyperventilation.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
