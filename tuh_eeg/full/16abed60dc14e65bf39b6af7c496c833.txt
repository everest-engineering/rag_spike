CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male status post PEA code x2 on the 14th, GI bleed.  Multiple prolonged codes now intubated and comatose with dilated pupils, but still triggering the vent.  Body temperature 95.8.
MEDICATIONS: DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE, EPINEPHRINE, VASOPRESSIN, PANTOPRAZOLE, LINEZOLID, PHENYLEPHRINE.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at  bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, comatose and unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly low voltage.  There is a rapid heart rate and some ICU artifacts.  Despite the artifacts, there is scant, occasional low voltage theta or delta waves.  Stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Heart rate 114 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:  Scant, low voltage cerebral activity which can be differentiated from the other ICU artifacts or heart rate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a severe CNS insult and is particularly worse, 3 days post cardiac arrest.  ECS montage was unplugged for part of the EEG given the patient's clinical exam, but a full ECS protocol was not completed because the patient continues to have spontaneous respirations.
If there any additional questions, a repeat study may be considered.
