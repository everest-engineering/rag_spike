CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 84-year-old woman with a history right acute intracerebral hemorrhage with tonic, clonic seizure at presentation.  The patient was agitated.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Ativan, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed  at bedside in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is continuous, it includes generous beta and muscle artifact.  There is an asymmetry in the muscle with a bit more muscle artifact on the right than the left.  In addition, there are sections of the record which do not have muscle artifact demonstrating intermittent asymmetry with destruction of fast or frequent activity on the right and a bit more right sided delta.
As the patient becomes a little drowsier, there is an increase in delta.
Heart rate:  Irregular, 120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal electroencephalogram.
Background: Prominent beta.
Asymmetry with more significant beta on the left compared to the right and more delta on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  The use of benzodiazepine may accentuate the beta activity.  The focal features are congruent with the hemorrhage.  No epileptiform features were noted.
