CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old female with history of hypertension, cardiac stent and hyperlipidemia with change in behavior, confused and agitated over the past few days.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol
REASON FOR STUDY:  Altered mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic and wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included only photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact at the beginning of the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen at times while awake.  The patient does appear to go into stage 1, stage 2 sleep.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittent at F7/T3 and sometimes at F8/T4 slightly more frequently on the left than the right hemisphere at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
There is generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times, there is more generalized slowing and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing as well as bilateral anterior temporal slowing (left more than right)
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is also nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
