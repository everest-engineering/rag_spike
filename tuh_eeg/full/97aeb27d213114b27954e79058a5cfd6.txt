Medications:	CLOZARIL,HYDROXYZINE HALDOL,BENZTROPINE,ATIVAN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude alpha rhythm that can be seen in short
fragments that reach 10 Hz.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.  During limited
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Hr was 96
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake only. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
