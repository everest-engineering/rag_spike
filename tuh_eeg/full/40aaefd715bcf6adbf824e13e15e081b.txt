History:	25 YR MALE WITH PMHX OF LEFT RESECTION WITH SZS.  PRESENTS WITH
SZS.  HEAD 53 CM
Medications:	Depakote, Versed gtt, Phenobarbital, Vimpat
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
There is an obvious hemispheric asymmetry with focal slowing over the left hemisphere.  The
posterior dominant rhythm achieves 9 Hz over the right but only 6 Hz over the left. There is
reactivity see on bilaterally to eye opening.  There is a breach rhythm on the left that corresponds to
the patient's known craniotomy scar.  Stage I sleep is briefly seen and characterized by slowing of
the posterior dominant rhythm on the right.
There is continuous focal theta and delta slowing noted over the left hemisphere (even in the setting
of the breach rhythm).  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Summary of Findings:
Breach artifact, continuous, left frontotemporal
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 60 minute EEG due to the presence of nearly continuous left sided focal
slowing and a breach rhythm. Focal slowing is seen in the setting of a structural brain lesion.
