History:	53 yo male with scoliosis, mental retardation and epilepsy.
Medications:	Topamax, Tegretol, Claritin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse, excessive theta
activity with overriding diffuse excessive beta activity.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Independent bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing was seen intermittently.  There are
intermittent, very sharply contoured discharged in the frontal and temporal regions which are not
clearly epileptogenic.  The high impedance makes it difficult to clearly delineate the morphology
and therefore a definitive statement regarding their electrical significance.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  No EKG  Technical difficulties: high impedances and continuous
movement artifact
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, bilateral temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is a limited ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and intermittent focal
bilateral anterior temporal slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of
moderate diffuse and focal cerebral dysfunction.  Please note that there are intermittent, sharply
contoured discharges which may be better defined on a repeat study with sedation.
