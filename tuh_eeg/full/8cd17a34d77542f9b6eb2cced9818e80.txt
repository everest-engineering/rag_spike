CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 82-year-old male with worsening left-sided weakness.  Past history of stroke, aortic stenosis, multiple other medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Plavix, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This EEG is remarkable for a significant muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, the overall EEG includes a relatively low voltage, beta pattern with scant alpha activity and generous muscle.  The technologist struggles with this record with impedance issues.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient is drifting into stage 2 sleep and does not significantly activate the record.  Light sleep follows this and in light sleep, there is an asymmetry with somewhat slower in the delta and a bit more delta noted in the right hemisphere compared to the left in relatively indeterminate sleep state.
Heart rate somewhat irregular at 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, EEG remarkable for:
Low voltage awake pattern.
An asymmetry with a bit more delta noted in the right hemisphere in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No definitive epileptiform features were noted.  A low voltage pattern is a nonspecific finding in a subject of this age.  The focal features noted in sleep may be correlated with clinical history and imaging.
