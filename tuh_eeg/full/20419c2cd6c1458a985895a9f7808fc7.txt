CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old gentleman with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and epilepsy, admitted for impaired mental status. Multiple previous evaluations for recurrent seizures and delirium. Past history of seizures with right arm jerking.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Topamax, Copaxone, Baclofen.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient has titubation of the head from side to side and asterixis of the left hand.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is not moving, the background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with a superimposed asymmetry. From the right hemisphere on occasion an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm is identified and there is a fair amount of theta on the right. In contrast, the left includes primarily rhythmic theta and delta. The video is reviewed and includes titubation of the head and the asterixis of the left hand. The right hand is under the covers and never moves.
HR: 76 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The behaviors described above do not appear to be seizures. There were no epileptiform features identified in this EEG in contrast to previous EEGs demonstrating sharp waves from the left hemisphere and left frontotemporal periodic complexes. If this individual is though to have additional seizures, a repeat study may be of value.
