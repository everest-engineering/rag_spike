CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 21-year-old male with congenital hydrocephalus, seizure-free since 2010, right ventriculostomy.
PAST HISTORY:  Preterm labor, intracerebral hemorrhage, spastic quadriplegia and childhood status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a technically challenging EEG for a poorly cooperative young adult.  Photic stimulation was completed, but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is moving almost continuously during the EEG.  The pattern includes a medium amplitude pattern with generous beta, perhaps some lambdas the patient looks about and otherwise a pattern of mixed theta delta.  Sleep was not possible.  Technologist and a family member was with the patient one-on-one in an attempt to increase cooperativity which was not possible.
Heart rate: 104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging, but abnormal EEG due to:
Absence of the normal waveforms anticipated for an adult of this age.
Diffusely slow background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  If additional information is needed, a more sedated study would be required.
