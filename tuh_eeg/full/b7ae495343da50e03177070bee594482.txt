History:	87 YR MALE WITH  SLURRED SPEECH.  APHASIC, RIGHT SIDE WEAKNESS.
Medications:	HEPARIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal in the temporal
region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. With an associated loss of faster
frequencies.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right midtemporal region
during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the left
hemisphere maximal in the temporal region.  This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in
this region. In addition there is  intermittent focal slowing in the right midtemporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
