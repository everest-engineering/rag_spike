History:	38 year old woman with a history of stroke at 1 year of age and seizures.
Medications:	Unclear, possibly Tegretol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a moderate amplitude 11 Hz alpha rhythm, which
attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently seen.  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  No normal sleep
Occasional polymorphic theta activity is noted over the right hemisphere  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Focal slowing, polymorphic, occasional, mild, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 22-minute EEG due to mild occasional right hemispheric
slowing. This finding is indicative of mild focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.
No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
