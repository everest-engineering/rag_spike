CLINICAL HISTORY:   48 year old right handed woman with past medical history of hypertension and migraines, who presents with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness with an aura versus spell, followed by loss of consciousness, mild shaking for 5-10 minutes, which did not respond to antiepileptic medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Metoprolol, Cardizem, Diovan, Fioricet.
REASON FOR EEG:  Episodes of loss of consciousness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Sleep stage I was recorded.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz and 20-60 mV of amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, did not reveal any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Very rare T4 focal slow wave.
SEIZURES  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
rare right mid temporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild right mid temporal focal cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
