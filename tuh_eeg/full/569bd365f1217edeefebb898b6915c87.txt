History:	27 Y O FEMALE HAVING SLEEPING DISORDER SINCE CHILDHOOD WHERE SHE
WILL NOT STAY ASLEEP BECAUSE OF SOB OR ANXIETY FELLING THAT
WAKES HER UP.NO HX SEIZURES, 5 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT.
Medications:	None
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows
further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  HR is 75 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Normal EEG
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL sleep deprived EEG, awake and drowsy.
