CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old left handed male with arm tremors followed by tonic-clonic seizures for the last month. These episodes occur 5 to 7 times per week. Last episode occurred during the EEG period. History of schizophrenia and coronary artery disease.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient had one of his typical spells during hyperventilation. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD; In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing with some bursts of FIRDA followed by brief vertex waves. Hyperventilation elicits one of the patient's typical events. The event occurs at 10:38 a.m. with shaking of the right hand and then later shaking of the left hand. The patient is interactive and can answer questions during the EEG. No postictal slowing is noted. Photic stimulation is performed while he is relatively drowsy and does not activate the record.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild to moderate background slowing for an adult of this age.
2. The behavior which was described by the patient as typical of his seizures and which had behavioral characteristics of a nonepileptic seizures. There was no EEG signature for this behavior.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional evaluation of this patient to determine the cause of these involuntary movements is suggested.
