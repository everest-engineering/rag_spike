CLINICAL HISTORY:   72 year old man with a chief complaint of headaches for 4 years since being assaulted in the neck.  Past medical history also includes diabetes and myocardial infarction.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Butalbital.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulate 8-Hz theta activity that continues with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies and lower amplitudes anteriorly. No sleep was recorded. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation does not produce any abnormalities or photic driving.
Epileptiform discharges: None.
The single EKG recording demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm.
FINDINGS:
Slow posterior dominant rhythm.
No sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is an abnormal, awake-only EEG, secondary to slow posterior dominant rhythm.  This indicates a nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction that in this case could be attributed to the presence of butalbital.  No sleep is recorded, and if a concern for seizures persists a study with sleep may be of benefit. No epileptiform discharges were recorded; however, the lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was recorded.  If concern for seizures persist a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
