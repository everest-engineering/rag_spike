CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old woman w1th an episode of cramps involving the left arm and leg. In addition, there was an episode of loss of consciousness lasting 5 minutes with incontinence. Past history of PCA stroke, left sided weakness, and TIA.
MEDICATIONS: Atrovent, Ativan, Lovenox, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient seems to be very sleepy and when she is stimulated, the EEG is disrupted with muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The sleep records includes 14 Hz sleep spindles, vertex waves, and bursts of FIRDA. Stimulation of the patient produces primarily a muscle artifact pattern with brief alerting and then the patient drifts off to sleep. On rare occasion with stimulation there does appear to be a 10 Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left. The right is obscured by muscle artifact.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is remarkable for:
1. Excess beta.
2. An excessively drowsy patient.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is a glimpse of what appears to be a normal awake pattern. The remainder of the EEG does appear to be somewhat low with some bursts of delta. Given the age of this patient, hypersomnolence or sleep pathology may produce a pattern described above. If there are concerns about an underlying encephalopathy or seizures, a follow up study when the patient is more cooperative is
suggested.
