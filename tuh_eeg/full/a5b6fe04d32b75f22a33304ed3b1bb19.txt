CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with a long history of alcohol dependence, frequent falling down the steps, schizophrenia, depression, pancreatitis, and tonic-clonic seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Serax, Amlodipine, Lovenox, Nystatin, Lorazepam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 7 hertz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background. The patient seems to be jittery with muscle artifact noted in the background. Photic stimulation produces again some muscle artifact. Heart rate 102 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The background slowing described above is a nonspecific finding, and it may be a postictal feature. If additional information is needed, a follow-up study in the lab may be important to search for epileptiform activity.
