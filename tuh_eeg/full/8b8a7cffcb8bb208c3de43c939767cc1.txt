History:	60 year old man who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by low amplitude 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Additionally, overriding monomorphic diffuse frontally predominant low-
to-moderate amplitude 4-5 Hz activity is captured during wakefulness.  It does not evolve.  It is seen
at the end of the recording.  During brief drowsiness, roving eye movements are noted.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy portable 23-minute EEG due to mild diffuse
slowing. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.  Burst of diffuse monomorphic theta-delta activity could be related to transient
global cerebral hypoperfusion, such as seen in hypotension or hypoglycemia.  Please correlate
