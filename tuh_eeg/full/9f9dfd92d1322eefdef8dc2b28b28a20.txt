History: 40 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/0 SUDDEN LOC LASTING X 20 Ml...
AWAKEN WITH C/C OF CHEST PAIN AND NOT MOVING LT SIDE. FOUND TO HAVE ACUTE RT SUBCORTICAL ISCHEMIC STROKE.
Medications:
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10.20 System; standard 21 electrodes
Description:
Waking background Is characterized by a 25-40UV, 11· 12 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV, 18·25Hz activity Is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal bola activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent During stage 2 sleep. The record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed. Stepped photic: stimulation is not performed. HR: 80 BPM
Summary of Findings:
Normal EEG
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a EEG does not rule out a diagnosis of epilepsy.
