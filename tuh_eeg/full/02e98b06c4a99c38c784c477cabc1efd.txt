CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 34-year-old woman with a 4-year history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures following deer tick disease.  Last seizure 2 days prior to the EEG characterized by loss of consciousness following biting tongue.  The patient may have an aura of left occipital numbness.  She reports status epilepticus in 2012 and multiple cranial scars.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is relatively low voltage with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm, generous low voltage, frontocentral beta and some low voltage, frontocentral theta.  Features of drowsiness include a decrease in eye movements, attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Lambda waves were noted just prior to photic stimulation.  Photic stimulation elicited a vigorous driving response with harmonic and supra-harmonic driving.  Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to scant, frontocentral theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  The scant theta described above can be due to medications or this patient's previous CNS process.
