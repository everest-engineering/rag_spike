CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed female with acute middle cerebral
artery infarct with hemiparesis, agitation and aphasia.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is unable to relax
and the EEG includes significant muscle artifact. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The limited EEG available for review includes a
relatively slow background with a mixture of theta and delta obscured by muscle artifact.
Despite the artifacts, there does appear to be additional left frontal delta.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess background muscle identified even when the patient starts to drift off to
sleep.
2. Slowing bilateral
CLINICAL There were no epileptiform features noted. If this patient's
mental status is not congruent with the imaging and clinical history, a followup study
may be of value.
