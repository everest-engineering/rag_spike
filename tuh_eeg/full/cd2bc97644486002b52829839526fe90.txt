CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 61-year-old male status post 3-vessel CABG on February 21st with balloon pump, cardiogenic shock on 03/02/2014.  Evaluate for change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Protonix, Colace, insulin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically acceptable 20-minute EEG with impedances generally under 5 kilo-ohms.  The patient was intubated and initially appeared to be unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is diffusely slow with a mixture of delta and theta.  There is some shifting asymmetries noted.  Tactile stimulation of the patient on some occasions produces an increase in theta.  Spontaneous movements were noted in the background.  There was some overall variability in the record and some sections of the record were much quieter with less in the way of spontaneous movement by the patient.  In addition, other sections demonstrated more vigorous theta.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 20-minute routine bedside portable EEG was remarkable for:
Generalized background slowing.
Some shifting slowing.
Occasional attenuations.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The pattern described above is a nonspecific finding, supporting a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were noted.  Although at times, the EEG did attenuate, the reactivity and variability described above are positive prognostic factors.  Ongoing clinical evaluation is suggested.
