CLINICAL HISTORY:  19 year old female with learning disability, asthma, ADHD and behavioral issues, admitted after an altercation with the police, now with opsoclonus and delirium.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This was an awake EEG and uncooperative patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In this markedly limited record, the interpretable sections of the record demonstrate a slow background with primarily a theta frequency pattern.  The patient's movement artifact is so remarkable that even the EKG lead is uninterpretable.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow theta pattern for an awake adult.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  If additional evaluation is needed, a follow-up study perhaps using a short-acting benzodiazepine is suggested.  These findings were discussed with the clinical team.
