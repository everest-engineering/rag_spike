Medications:	TEGRETOL

EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by PDR that at best reaches 9 Hz with 25-40uV . However in
wakefulness it appears to spread anteriorly.  There a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  Excess
diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 7-8Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during
drowsiness.  Some disorganization is seen despite wakefulness.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate
voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present bilaterally in the frontotemporal region (right much
more than left).  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR 90.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, frequent, bilateral (R>L) frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the
bilaterally in the frontotemporal region (right much more than left) region.  This finding is
indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific. In addition there is mild
diffuse background slowing and disorganization.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific
indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
