Dilantin, Percocet, Lisinopril, ASA, Nifedipine, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somewhat agitated
and awake.
OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized. There is a
7.5 Hz alpha rhythm which is better identified on the left compared to the right. There is
arrhythmic delta activity, more prominent on the right compared to the left, and a
handful of right mid to anterior temporal sharp waves.
120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Superimposed focal slowing on the right.
3. Some sharply contoured slow waves or sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION These findings may be correlated with imaging. A
structural functioning process on the right involving gray and white matter should be
considered.
