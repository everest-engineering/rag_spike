History:	89 year old man who remains altered after an episode of bradycardia and loss of
consciousness.
Medications:	Mucomyst/ Albuterol, Insulin, Aztreonam
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low-to-
moderate voltage polymorphic delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to
posterior gradient of frequencies.  Intermittent periods of background discontinuity are noted.
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the
recording.  These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag and become more
prominent with stimulation.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
Paucity of faster frequencies and lower voltages are noted over the right hemisphere.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a
single EKG lead.
Summary of Findings:
Discontinuous background, intermittent
No electrographic seizures
Cardiac arrhythmia
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Triphasic waves, continuous
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing, periods of
discontinuity, continuous triphasic waveforms and focal slowing over the right hemisphere.  These
findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific,
but suggestive of a metabolic origin.  Focal slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly
structural in etiology.  Triphasics waveforms are seen in various types of encephalopathy.  No
electrographic seizures are present.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
