AGE: 24 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/24/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 40-60 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1724
HISTORY :
24 y.o. male with a history of possible seizures since age 15 referred for routine EEG. for evaluation of paroxysmal events .
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
divalproex (DEPAKOTE ER) 500 mg 24 hr tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .
EEG BACKGROUND :
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with occasional excess of theta frequencies. There is a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) . The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured.
Mild generalized slowing is present. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
None
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is performed for 180 seconds with good cooperation and produces no effect.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 54-60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Mild generalized slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
