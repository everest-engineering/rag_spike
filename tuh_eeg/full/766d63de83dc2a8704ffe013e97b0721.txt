MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol, Prednisone,  Primacort.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Drowsiness increases the synchronicity of the record.
HR: 	60-70 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No focal nor epileptiform features are observed.  Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
