MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lisinopril, Amlodipine, Simvastatin, ASA.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was conducted but hyperventilation was not because of the patients cardiac history.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a well-organized study with alpha rhythm present at 9 Hz. Amplitude was normal. During photic stimulation, there was minimal driving elicited. Hyperventilation was not conducted.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity. Given the amount of atherosclerotic, cerebrovascular disease, this was an essentially normal study.
