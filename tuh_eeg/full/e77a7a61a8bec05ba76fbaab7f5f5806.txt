CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old woman with early onset and aggressive Alzheimer disease, now with myoclonus, loss of balance and stiffening.
MEDICATIONS:  Namenda, Seroquel
INTRODUCTION:  Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has a great deal of difficulty cooperating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Underneath the muscle and movement artifact, this is a relatively featureless, slow EEG. There are some myoclonic jerk or muscle jerk movements. There is a pattern of more rhythmic diffuse theta-delta. There are some posteriorly predominant bursts of delta. Using a referential montage, the delta may begin frontally and then transition to a more posterior nature. There is a single C4 sharp wave.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a theta-delta pattern.
Myoclonic jerks which produced muscle artifact.
Likely focal sharp waves from the right hemisphere.
Some quasi-periodic delta which is poorly localized with this challenging study.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function which my be toxic or metabolic or related to a neurodegenerative
disorder.  The sharp waves and the poorly defined periodic activity is concerning.  Additional EEG recording was requested as a result of this.
