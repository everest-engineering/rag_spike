LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes
DESCRIPTION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old man with a prior history of left MCA territory stroke who now presents with a chief complaint of chest pain and syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lovenox, Tylenol, Plavix and Lasix.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Continuous EMG artifact is present over the bifrontal regions.  Intermittent drowsiness is captured.  Stage II sleep is not recorded.  Intermittent fluctuating excessive theta is observed over the bitemporal region, significantly more prominent over the left temporal leads.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in no change in background.  Regular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:  Shifting mild to moderate bitemporal slowing, more common over the left temporal region.  No stage II sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.  Regular heart rate.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22-minute awake and drowsy EEG due to mild to moderate shifting bitemporal slowing that is more pronounced over the left temporal region.  This finding indicates a nonspecific underlying cerebral dysfunction that is more prominent over the left temporal region.  In a patient with a prior left MCA territory stroke, more pronounced left temporal slowing is consistent with his history of prior stroke.  No epileptiform discharges are captured; however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  A regular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.
