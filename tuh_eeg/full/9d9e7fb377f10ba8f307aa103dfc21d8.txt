Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, lethargic
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Frequent brief (2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves
occur throughout the recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  No normal sleep
No focal slowing is present.  Occasional focal sharp waves are present in the right frontal region at
F4 and prefrontal region at FP2.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, intermittent, left frontal
Sharp waves, intermittent, left midline frontal
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  frequent epileptiform discharges in the right frontal and
prefrontal region.  These findings are indicative of a potentially epileptogenic focus in this region.
In addition there is  diffuse background slowing, FIRDA and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings
are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
