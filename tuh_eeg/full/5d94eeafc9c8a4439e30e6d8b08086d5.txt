CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 23-year-old woman with history of anxiety, itching, dizziness, and an allergic reaction.
MEDICATIONS:  Sumatriptan, Ativan, ibuprofen, Zithromax, Epipen, Celexa, Atarax, Ativan, Deltasone, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
This was a technically acceptable, routine outpatient EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric reactive 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta.  The patient demonstrates frequent, spontaneous arousals from sleep.
Hyperventilation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.
