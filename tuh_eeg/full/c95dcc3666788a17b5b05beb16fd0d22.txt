CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 46-year-old woman with left parietal AVM, neurofibromatosis, newly diagnosed refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient has reportedly had recently coiling.   Technically, this is a difficult study in a patent who keeps scratching and moving about.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there are sections of the record where there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The right hemisphere remains a little bit slow and disorganized.  The left hemisphere demonstrates intermittent arrhythmic delta activity with relatively complex sharp waves noted in the left hemisphere including left mid to anterior temporal region as well as sometimes posterior temporal region.  There are also a handful of sharp waves noted in the right central temporal region. The focal slowing on the left may occur as more prolonged paroxysmal bursts or be a little bit more subtle and irregular.  In stage II sleep, vertex waves and spindles were identified.
Photic stimulation does not particularly activate the record although T% sharp waves were a bit more prominent in photic stimulation.  The patient also was transitioning into sleep during photic.
Heart rate 194 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Improved but abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Superimposed left focal slowing.
Sharp waves seen from the left hemisphere with various different localizations including left hemisphere, left temporal but also now on the right.
