History:	95 year old woman with a history of seizures, now with new onset of intermittent
right shoulder twitching.
Medications:	Tylenol, asa, dulcolax, keppra, prinivil, toprol-xl, novolog
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists at best of low amplitude 6-6.5 Hz theta.  AP gradient is
preserved.  During drowsiness there is increase in diffuse theta and appearance of prolonged bursts
of diffuse delta activity.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart of <60 bpm with
occasional premature QRS complexes (with associated up to 2 second pauses between premature
and subsequent QRS complex).
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 20-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing that is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart of <60
bpm with occasional premature QRS complexes (with associated up to 2 second pauses between
premature and subsequent QRS complex).
