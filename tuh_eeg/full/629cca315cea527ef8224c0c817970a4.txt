CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old male with refractory epilepsy, recent increase in seizures and nocturnal psychosis (later disclosed as nocturnal suicidal ideation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous EEG monitoring was performed using digital video EEG monitoring with 1 channel electrocardiogram, seizure and spike detection.  The patient had a pushbutton event for a behavior.  In addition there were many accidental pushbuttons as well.  The technical quality was acceptable.
TECHNICAL:  This section of the record has acceptable technical quality.
AWAKE AND SLEEP:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a small amount of 7 Hz theta and a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and POSTS.
INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES:  Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep include abundant left anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes with focal slowing.  Bursts of sharp waves are noted, but no clinical seizures were identified.  Sleep was somewhat fragmented, but there were no nocturnal disturbances and no unusual behaviors out of sleep.
BEHAVIOR:  The patient had a series of pushbuttons between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. on the July 3.  These are a combination of accidental pushbuttons, but there is another episode where he seems to be staring and chewing.  The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern for all of these.
HEART RATE:  72 BPM.
