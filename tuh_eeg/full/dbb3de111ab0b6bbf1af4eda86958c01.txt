History:	67 year old woman who presents with change in mental status.
Medications:	Insulin, Tramadol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 8.5-9 Hz alpha activity.  There is weak
anterior-to-posterior frequency-amplitude gradient.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity
is present throughout the recording.  During periods of quiescence, sleep architecture consisting of
vertex waves and K-complexes is noted.
Continuous polymorphic theta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce additional abnormalities.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, bilateral temporal, anterior
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
continuous moderate bilateral anterior-temporal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild
diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Continuous focal slowing indicates
focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.
