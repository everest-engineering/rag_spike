History:	67 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF BLOOD CLOTS LUNGS. EEG DURING PULMONARY
THROMBOEMBOLECTOMY.
Medications:	INDUCTION: VERSED,  ETOMIDATE, FENTANYL, ROCURONIUM,   MAINT:
ISOFLURANE, FENTANYL NITROGLYCERIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, >60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions. As the record continues there is diffuse theta slowing with excess diffuse
beta, this slowly transitions to diffuse delta slow and bursts suppression pattern  The EEG then
progressively becomes attenuated and then isoelectric with cooling. After rewarming slowly a burst
suppression pattern returns.  The bursts consist mainly of diffuse delta slowing which at times were
slightly asymmetric from left to right independently.  INCISION: 8:48 AM, HEPARIN: 9:08 AM,
BYPASS: 9:21 AM, CIRRC ARREST:  10:29 AM/ OFF 10:45 AM , ON 10:50A /OFF 1:17AM
COOLING: 9:23 AM, SUPPRESSION: 10:08 AM, WARMING: 11:18 AM
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Technical difficulties: During cooling
there was an intermittent non-cerebral machine artifact present.
Summary of Findings:
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an uneventful 6 hours EEG during a brain cooling surgery.
