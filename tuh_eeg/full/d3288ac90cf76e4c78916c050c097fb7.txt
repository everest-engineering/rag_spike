History:	21YO MALE WITH NEW ONSET SZ SUMMER 2014. SINCE LAST SUMMER HE
HAS BEEN HAVING "MINOR SZ." DESCRIBED AS TONGUE BITE, SUBTLE
SHAKING, + LOC, LASTING HALF HOUR. LAST SZ LAST WEEK.
Medications:	XANAX
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  Frequent bursts lasting 1-2 seconds of frontal predominant mainly
symmetric generalized 4-4.5Hz spike and wave and polyspike-and-wave.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Spike-and-wave complexes, fast
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of bifrontal synchronous spike-and-wave
and polyspike-and-wave discharges, which are potentially epileptogenic. Waking background
activity is normal.  These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary generalized epilepsy.
