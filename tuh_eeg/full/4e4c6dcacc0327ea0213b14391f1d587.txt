AGE: 29 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/19/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, drowsy and asleep EEG #: 15-1701
HISTORY:
29 y.o. male with a history of epilepsy referred for routine EEG for : BORN WITHCP, Chiari malformation with a
dysmorphic appearance to the ventricular system	and VP SHUNT ON HIS LEFT SIDE. PT HAS A HX OF SZ. LAST SZ WAS A COUPLE YEARS AGO. PT HAD A ?  SZ THIS MONTH, HE WAS STARING OFF WITH SUBTLE SHAKING.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
levetiracetam (KEPPRA) 500 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth 2 times daily.
ibuprofen (ADVIL,MOTRIN) 400 mg tablet, Take 400 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed.
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the
International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta
activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive	Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
During drowsiness , slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	There is some shifting slowing noted in the posterior regions in drowsiness
No generalized slowing is present.	No significant focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed .
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any abnormalities.
EVENTS :
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 72 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
This is a normal awake and drowsy routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
This study is within the range of normal.	Stage II sleep was not obtained , which can be helpful in identification of epileptiform features
A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
