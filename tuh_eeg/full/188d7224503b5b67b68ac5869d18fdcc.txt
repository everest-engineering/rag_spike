History:	FOLLOW UP 1 HOUR EEG ON 40 YR MALE WITH NOCTURNAL SEIZURES.
Medications:	DEPAKOTE, PHENOBARBITAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  At time the frontal theta appears to be slightly rhythmic but has no evolution.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 1 hour EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.
These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
