History:	64 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS ON 2/8/15 WITH H/O EPISODE AT HM OF
SOMNOLENCE AND DYSARTHRIA, LATER NOTED WITH SLURRED SPEECH
POST FALL. ALSO NOTED WITH ARM JERKS AND STARRING SPELL, AT
BASELINE PT HAS RT SIDED WEAKNESS. PMHX SIG FOR CVA, DM2, CAD
Medications:	NO AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Limited wakefulness reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reached at best 7Hz was present.
Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage theta activity with absence of the
expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
