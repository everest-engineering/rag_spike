CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 80-year-old male found on the floor with confusion.  History of atrial fibrillation.  CT scan demonstrates left frontal hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Nicardipine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the emergency room using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was poorly cooperative.  This is a technically challenging EEG with most impedances below 5 kilohms, but it is an interpretable 20-minute bedside study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is diffusely slow and poorly organized with a posterior dominant rhythm reaching a maximum of 7 Hz.  There is background theta noted throughout.  Muscle and chew artifact as well as movement artifact was noted.
Heart rate is irregular, 100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record, although movement and muscle artifact may obscure some of this.  If additional information is needed, a followup study when the patient is a bit more cooperative is suggested.
