CLINICAL HISTORY:  76 year old man found to have intracerebral hemorrhage on the right hemisphere.  The patient remains agitated and stuporous.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Metoprolol, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Agitation.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal leads and EKG.  Stages seen were during wakefulness only.  Activating procedures were not done.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background rhythm is around 3 Hz with 20-70 mV.  It is asymmetric and slightly depressed on the right.  There is no normal frontal central beta noted.  There was no sleep stages noted.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slowing with attenuation of the right hemisphere, shifting frontal delta.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing with attenuation of the right hemisphere.
FIRDA
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Features of shifting frontal delta activities may be seen in diffuse cerebral dysfunction, or frontal lobe dysfunction, or toxic metabolic encephalopathy, or increased intracranial pressure.  Clinical correlation recommended.
