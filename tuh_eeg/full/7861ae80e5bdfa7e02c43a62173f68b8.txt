CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old woman with multiple severe medical problems,
status post surgery for decubitus, past history of seizures, now with an episode of eye
deviation, treated with Ativan and Dilantin.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Protonix, Zofran, Nystatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is described as
unresponsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is low voltage, slow with a
mixture of delta and theta. There is eye movement artifact. There is little in the way of
variability or reactivity to external stimuli. Eye movement artifacts are noted, but there
are no periodic or paroxysmal eye movements observed.
HR: 120bpm   IMPRESSION
Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A very low voltage slow EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION No epileptiform features are observed. This EEG
supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function which may be associated with
medication effect.
