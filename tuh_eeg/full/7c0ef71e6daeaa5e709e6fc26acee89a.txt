:
47 YO FEMALE P/W SOB AT 5PM ABOUT 1/2 HOUR LATER PT STARTED TO HAVE MYOCLONIC JERKING AND SUDDENLY HAD A PEA ARREST X2, TOTAL DOWN TIME  10 MINUTES.
PMHX: ASTHMA AND SZ
PROPOFOL (20), PROTONIX, LOVENOX
Routine, awake & drowsy
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by bursts diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. Some anterior predominant sharply countoured delta can be seen.  In between the bursts there are periods of diffuse background attenuation lasting up to 4 seconds.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 114
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, marked diffuse Attenuation, intermittent diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing intermittent attenuation and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction which may be due at least in P.	to medication effect.
