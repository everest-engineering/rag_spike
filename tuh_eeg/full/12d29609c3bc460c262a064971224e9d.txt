REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 64-year-old man with new onset seizures on March 18th and 19th of 2013 with loss of consciousness, shaking, and history of previous stroke in 2010 with left-sided paralysis.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, citalopram, and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the entire recording, diffuse muscle artifact seen which limits any review of the recording, limited clear findings can be seen over the left central region, otherwise all the other channels are mainly obscured to any clear evaluation.  This is a very limited recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm can only be seen over the left occipital region and appears to reach 8 Hz and be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  Nothing can be said on normal frontal central beta or organization of the EEG.  There may be some slowing over the right temporal and left temporal, but this cannot be clearly asserted.  No clear seizures were seen.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Extremely limited EEG with no clear seizures.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clear assessment can be made due to this limited EEG, but no overt seizures were seen.  If clinically desired, a repeat EEG can be performed with sedation to better evaluate the underlying brain activity.  No clear determinations can be made based on this very limited EEG.
