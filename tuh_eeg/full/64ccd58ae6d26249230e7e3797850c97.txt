with medications. Last seizure was 10/13.  head 53 cm
Medications:	TEGRETOL, ELAVIL, LEVOTHYROXINE, VITAMINS.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5-12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No normal sleep architecture is present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair effort, and produces no effect.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL awake-only 26-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.
