History:	54 YO FEMALE WITH HX OF SZ WITH LOC. PT CLAIMS TO HAVE HAD 2
EPISODES IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS .
Medications:	LAMICTAL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-8.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions. There is diffuse 7Hz theta activity in wakefulness.  During brief drowsiness,
the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex
waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic theta activity is present in the right temporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and increases diffuse
background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not
produce any effect.  HR is 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, rhythmic
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right temporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of 1) intermittent focal slowing in the right temporal region.
This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  2) diffuse
background slowing.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a
diagnosis of intermittent seizures or epilepsy.
