History:	45 YR OLD FEMALE WITH PRIOR EEG. NOW NOTED WITH SZ THIS AM, EEG TO
R/O STATUS
Medications:	ATIVAN, KEPPRA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, obtunded
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse alpha
frequency activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. This is
best seen over the right hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left hemisphere maximal midtemporal
region.  Continuous spikes and polyspikes are present in the left mid to posterior temporal region
that appear to increase in frequency (3 to 6Hz) and decrease but not subside during the entire
study.  There was no clinical correlate associated to this EEG activity documented on video.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Hr was 90
Summary of Findings:
Status epilepticus, continuous, left temporal
Sharp waves, continuous, left
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  electrographic status epilepticus arising from the left
temporal region. There is additional continuous focal slowing in the region which is consistent with
an irritable structural lesion in the region.  Lastly there is mild diffuse slowing, this finding is
indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is non-specific with regards to etiology.
