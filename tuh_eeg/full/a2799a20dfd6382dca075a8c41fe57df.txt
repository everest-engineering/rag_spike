History:	34 YO MALE, R. HANDEDNESS, RECENTLY FELL TO GROUND, LOC, DOES NOT
RECALL EXACT DAY AND NO MEMORY OF EPISODE.
Medications:	NONE
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10-12Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  There is excessive diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz (beta) activity present,
maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and
5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Beta, excessive diffuse
Alpha rhythm, normal
Interpretation:
This is a mildly ABNORMAL 21 minute EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
