CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with aneurysms, episodes of
right-sided headache with visual scintillations, and an unusual spacey feeling as well as
right arm pain. Past history of a single alcohol related seizure in the past.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Pamelor, Sertraline, Nortriptyline, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed but photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and drowsy record
in an anxious patient.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm of 30
microvolts with frequent eye blink artifact. Features of drowsiness include an increase
in theta but the patient actually still has frequent eye blinking. Photic stimulation does
not activate the record.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this
normal EEG. Additional evaluation may be appropriate, particularly if this individual has
recurrent spells.
