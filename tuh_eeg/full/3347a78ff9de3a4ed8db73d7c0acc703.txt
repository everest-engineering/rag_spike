History:	37 year old woman who had a witnessed seizure last night.  Patient has hepatorenal
failure.

Due to patient's agitation, impedances in several leads are high.
Medications:	Dilaudid
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic
moderate-to-high amplitude theta and delta activity.  Patient remains awake throughout the
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is abundant movement and
EMG artifact throughout the recording. Certain portions of the recording are not interpretable.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Artifact, EMG, abundant
Artifact, movement, abundant
Interpretation:
This is a TECHNICALLY LIMITED 32-minute portable EEG because of abundant EMG and
electrode artifacts. Background is overall moderately diffusely slow.  This finding is indicative of
moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  More prolonged
recording may be of benefit for periods of quiescence to be captured.  These findings were reported the team.
