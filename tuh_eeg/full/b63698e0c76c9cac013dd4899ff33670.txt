History:	44 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS WITH H/O SZ GIVEN DILANTIN AND SENT HOME (
PT SEEN AT OSH) PT THEN HAD 2ND SZ/RESP DISTRESS. PMHX SIG FOR
DRUG ABUSE, SZ
Medications:	DILANTIN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
becomes intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Short sleep latency is noted.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 78
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
