Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG

Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 24 hours from 1/11/2015 to 1/12/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.  Ongoing raw EEG data was reviewed
by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG patterns.   All automatically
detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.

Description of pushbutton events
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation/ during arousals, the background consists of a
mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity with delta activity most pronounced anteriorly.  No
normal sleep architecture is noted but periods of quiescence are clearly present and are
characterized by diffuse moderate-to-high amplitude polymorphic delta activity.
No clearly sustained focal slowing is noted.  No clear electrographic seizures are present.
There is continuous artifact in F8 leads.  As the recording progresses, more leads are affected and
by the end of the recording epoch, EEG is no longer interpretable.  Bed percussion artifact is
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, electrode, significant artifact affecting multiple leads for the majority of the recording
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 24-hour continuous video EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No
electrographic seizures are present, but there is progressive electrode artifact that affects nearly all
of the leads by the end of the recording and makes EEG uninterpretable.
