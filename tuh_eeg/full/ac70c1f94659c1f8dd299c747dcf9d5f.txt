History: 49 Y/O MALE R HANDED PMHX. N/A PT.COMPLAINS OF CRAWLING SENSATION FRONTAL SCALP X 3 WEEKS.OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH LIGHTHEADEDNESS. 54 CM HEAD.
Medications: none
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
I have personally reviewed this study, and this report represents my findings and conclusions.
