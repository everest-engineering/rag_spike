History:	71 yr old male s/p CABG, now with right MCA stroke and change in mental status.
Medications:	Heparin, Zosyn, Insulin, Folic Acid, Aspirin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
During maximal arousal, the background consists of 10 Hz PDR, weak AP gradient and diffuse low
amplitude theta activity.  PDR is unstable over the Right.  Patient is asleep throughout the majority
of the recording. Sleep spindles are noted.  They are better visualized over the left.
Attenuation of faster frequencies is observed over the right.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, right hemispheric
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal 22 minutes awake and mostly asleep EEG due to mild diffuse slowing that is
more pronounced over the right. Diffuse slowing is etiologically nonspecific indicator of mild diffuse
cerebral dysfunction.  Focal slowing is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the right hemisphere
and is consistent with patient's history of right MCA territory stroke.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
