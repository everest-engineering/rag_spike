History:	80 YR FEMALE WITH HTN, GERD, DIVERTICULITIS, BARRETTS ESOPHAGUS,
DEMENTIA, WITH CC OF CHANGE IN MS. PER DAUGHTER PT WAS SITTING
AND HAD RIGHT  HAND TREMBLING, AND TONGUE PROTRUSION.LASTED
LESS THEN A MINUTE AND THEN WAS OK.
Medications:	Protonix, ASA
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 6-7 posterior dominant rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Background activity is predominantly irregular 50-75uV, 6-7Hz
activity.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR could not be obtained due to a problem with the EKG signal
Technical difficulties: no comments can be made about the right temporal region as there was
continuous myogenic artifact impeding the evaluation of this area.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate, bilateral
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing.  These
findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
