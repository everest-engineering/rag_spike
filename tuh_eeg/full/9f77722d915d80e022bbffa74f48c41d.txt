REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old woman with a right frontal craniotomy on July 6, 2012, and seizures a couple of days after and had surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Cozaar, Lopid, Flonase, albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedure included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is mild excessive beta seen diffusely.  the patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges which included only photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F8/F4 while in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F8/F4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  There is an increased amplitude and presence of faster frequencies consistent with a breach rhythm in that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  Eighty-four.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to right frontal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of  localization-related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the right frontal region.  In addition, there is evidence focal cerebral dysfunction in the right frontal region consistent with the known surgery.   No seizures were seen.
