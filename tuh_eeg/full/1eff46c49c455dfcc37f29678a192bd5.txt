History:	34 year old woman with long-standing epilepsy, with last seizure in 2012.  Patient
ran out of Depakote and Lamictal several weeks ago.
Medications:	seroquel
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha
rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Rare polymorphic theta activity is noted over the left mid-temporal region.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, rare, mild, left temporal, mid
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
Interpretation:
This is a minimally abnormal awake and briefly drowsy 28-minute EEG due to rare mild left
midtemporal slowing. This finding is indicative of mild focal cerebral dysfunction.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to
the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
