History:	43yo F with a Hx anxiety, possible syncope vs seizure 3 years ago, now with
Medications:	effexor, hydroxyzine, ziprasidone, trazodone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  No sleep was captured.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect. There is
a prominent electrical artifact during photic stimulation.  There was prominent EMG and
movement artifact throughout the record.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  EEG is limited because of abundant EMG and
movement artifact.  If clinically indicated, suggest repeat EEG with sedation.
