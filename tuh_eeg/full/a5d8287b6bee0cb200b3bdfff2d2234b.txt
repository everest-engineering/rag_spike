Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Diffuse beta activity is also seen.  There is occasional left
temporal slowing in delta range during wakefulness.  During drowsiness, intermittent bursts of
diffuse, frontally maximal sharply-contoured slow discharges, at times with spike-and-slow wave
morphology with no evolution are present.  No normal sleep architecture was present despite
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR is
Summary of Findings:
, Abnormal EEG
Interpretation:
This is an abnormal EEG due to 1) intermittent focal slowing in the left temporal region.  This
finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  2) bursts of
diffuse slow activity with spike-and-slow wave morphology during drowsiness.  These findings are
of uncertain clinical significance. Clinical correlation is recommended.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to  medication
effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
