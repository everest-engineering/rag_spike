History:	49 year old woman with a history of seizures since the age of 5 yr.  Seizures occur monthly.
Medications: Dilantin, Others in report
Sedation:
EEG Type: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic

Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV,  10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Continuous polymorphic, occasionally sharply contoured, theta and delta activity is present in the left temporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. Similar activity to a lesser degree is observed over the right temporal region. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and accentuates focal slowing in the left temporal region. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.

Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left temporal, mild-to-moderate; often sharply contoured Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, mild-to-moderate
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges

Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL  awake and briefly drowsy EEG due to bitemporal,  left»right, focal mild-to? moderate slowing. These findings indicate focal cerebral dysfunction,  possibly structural in etiology.   No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
