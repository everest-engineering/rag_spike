TECHNIQUE:
A	bedside portable	21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG.	The patient is described as comatose but does have some motor withdrawal.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is symmetric and consists of a low-voltage, featureless pattern . The activity is most attenuated in the posterior regions. In the frontal regions, there are GPEDS . These demonstrate a periodicity of 1.2 to 2.5 Hz. Occasional triphasic waves are noted .
Generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present .
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Tactile stimulation the patient does not significantly activate the record
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 112 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION :
Abnormally marked background slowing i2 GPEDS without evolution
i3 triphasic waves CLINICAL CORRELATION :
This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.	Contributing factors can include medications and/or other diffuse, bihemispheric disturbances .
