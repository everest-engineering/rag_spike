History:	59 YO MALE WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, HEART ATTACK, SOB.
PMHX: CHF, MIDD MR
Medications:	ASA, PLAVIX, HEPARIN, COREG, DECOSATE, LASIX,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely, followed
by symmetric vertex waves.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-
4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 120 with PVCs
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
