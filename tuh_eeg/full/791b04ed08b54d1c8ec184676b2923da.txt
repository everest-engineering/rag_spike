CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed female with a past medical history of migraine, multiple sclerosis, and seizures since last year who presents for EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta activity.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES;  Focal sharp waves seen at T3 and T4 independently, at times with more anterior symptoms and more posterior negativity.  In addition, there is frequent focal slowing, also seen at T3 and T4, independently with a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal independent bitemporal sharp waves.
Frequent focal slowing in the bilateral and temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from either midtemporal lobe.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction independently seen in both midtemporal lobes, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
