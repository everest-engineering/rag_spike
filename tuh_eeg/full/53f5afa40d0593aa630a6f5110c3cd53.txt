EEG REPORT
CLINICAL HISTORY: A 53-year-old woman with a history of traumatic labor and delivery and perinatal anoxia, complicated by traumatic brain injury at age 5 and multiple minor head traumas since then. The patient has frequent episodes with confusion, in continence, and automatic behavior occurring 1-3 times per week.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lantus, and atorvastatin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10Â·20 system of electrode
placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was deferred. Photic stimulation was completed.
The patient was very sleepy during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The majority of the EEG includes stage I and stage II sleep with spindles noted in stage II sleep. Vertex waves were noted In stage I. Brief arousals elicited an awake pattern with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm Identified bilaterally.
In the majority of the record, the patient is asleep or drowsy. There Is subtle focal slowing seen primarily In the left frontotemporal region. Left anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes were noted, ranging from
high amplitude spike and slow wave complexes with a generous field of spread in the left anterior temporal region, to lower amplitude or more complex discharges many of which are isoelectric at F71T1 .
These seem to be accentuated by sleep with higher amplitude discharges. In addition in sleep, there are bursts of hypersynchronous frontal delta with a left frontal spike noted. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving. The epileptiform activity seemed to have increased around the time of photic stimulation. but cannot be directly linked to it.
Heart rate: 68 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal focal sharp waves and spikes.
2. Some bursts of frontal delta with a left frontal sharp wave .
3. Subtle focal slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization;-elated mechanism for epilepsy.
