CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old left handed male with linear nevus syndrome, status post left temporal lobectomy, now complaining of neck pain, wrist pain, and foot pain.

MEDICATIONS: Depakene, Eucerin, Flonase, Fosamax, Terbinafine, Topamax, Zoloft

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
This is an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is somewhat
slow and disorganized with primarily a theta frequency background and the suggestion
of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm. Unilateral eye movement artifact is observed in this individual
with a prosthetic eye on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
background theta. Towards the close of the record, left posterior temporal sharp waves
are observed, as is occasional focal slowing. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving
response.

HR: 66bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left posterior temporal sharp wave, including T5, P3, and T3.
2. intermittent left posterior temporal focal slowing.
3. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the left, a
breech rhythm, and skull defect artifact are noted. The left posterior temporal spikes
and sharps may be accentuated by the craniotomy defects.
