CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old admitted on the 5th, status post cardiac arrest on the 7th, status post BIVAICD, persistently intubated, comatose, but does over-breathe the ventilator.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin and antibiotics.  No sedative hypnotic medications listed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and comatose.  The patient was stimulated during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a technically somewhat challenging ICU record.  The overall activity is markedly low voltage and suppressed.  There are some ICU artifacts noted in the record.
Reviewing the record with an average reference, there appears to be some scant cerebral activity, essentially an island of cerebral activity at the midline at PZ/P4 with a scant amount of low voltage 5 to 6 Hz theta which cannot be considered definitively an artifact.  There is no reactivity, and aside from the activity described above, there is no variability.
Heart rate 108 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to marked paucity with scant cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG carries an extremely worrisome prognosis in the context of anoxic encephalopathy, 48 hours after the event.  If there are any additional questions, a followup study may be of value.  Given the ICU artifacts described above, should this patient need additional end-of-life neurophysiological evaluation, a blood flow study may be helpful.
