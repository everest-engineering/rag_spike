CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 77-year-old woman evaluated by rapid response on the 27th for acute left-sided weakness.  Prolonged hospital stay, currently in isolation.  Hypertension, chronic renal disease, and C difficile infection.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, aspirin, Tricor, and Norvasc.  No sedative-hypnotic medications listed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the pulmonary unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy patient, who was quite fragile.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is disorganized.  There is a glimpse of a 7 Hz alpha rhythm with shifting arrhythmic delta.  Stimulation of the patient such as suctioning produces an increase in alpha frequency as well as an increase in beta.  When unstimulated, the patient seems to become a bit drowsy, little bit more shifting, slowing, more prominent on the left.  Spontaneous arousals were identified.
Heart rare 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to;
Diffusely slow and poorly organized EEG.
Shifting and slowing, more so on the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The pattern described above is nonspecific, supporting a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, affecting gray and white matter.
