CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed male with left-sided weakness, past stroke, left amputation. Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Norvasc, Metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a somewhat slow pattern from the left hemisphere.  The alpha rhythm is 8-9 Hz, but there is some background theta.  The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity.  In addition, sharp waves are noted in the right hemisphere, particularly the central and temporal regions with variable maximum.  The sharp waves may be seen at C4, T4 or T6.  Using averaged reference, they are primarily posterotemporal, but not all sharp waves are identical and some have more of an anterior spread, others more posterior and others more parietal.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmicity of the background.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, there are some bursts of FIRDA and there is some wicket noted in the right or left temporal region.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG to due:
Intermittent bursts of arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.
Sharp waves noted from the right hemisphere with variable maximum.  These can be seen in the posterotemporal, parietal or occipital regions as well as with the spread to the central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are supportive of a focal mechanism for seizures. The bursts of focal slowing support a structural or functional process in the right hemisphere.  The sharp waves are primarily in the right posterior quadrant with variable maximum.
