CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 46-year-old woman with prior aneurysm, admitted with left arm numbness and weakness.  Patient had an episode with loss of consciousness, tongue biting, and eyes rolling up.  Previous aneurysm with right-sided clip.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient was very drowsy in the initial sections of the record.  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally, high amplitude on the left in comparison to the right.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is an amplitude asymmetry in the overall background. There is lower voltage on the right temporal region compared to the left.  Spindles, POSTS, and occasional vertex waves were noted in stage 2 sleep.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for:
an amplitude asymmetry and a relatively low voltage record with a lower voltage pattern on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  The EEG in 2008 and 02/08/2013 did not identify epileptiform activity, although the 2013 study did identify bitemporal slowing.  If additional information is needed, a follow up study when the patient is awake and alert may be valuable to search for epileptiform activity.
