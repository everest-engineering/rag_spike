DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions frequently from wakefulness to stage I and stage II sleep with slowing of the alpha rhythm and increase in beta, vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS, followed by arousals. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in a relatively sleepy patient.
