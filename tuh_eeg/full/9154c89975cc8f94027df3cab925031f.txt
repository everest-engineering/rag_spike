CLINICAL 51 year old right handed woman with a recent stroke and 2 complex
partial seizures characterized by twitching of the left face lasting several minutes, past right
MCA infarct and craniectomy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lisinopril, Norvasc, Gabapentin, Percocet, HCTZ, Lovenox, Keppra,
Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. The patient is awake, communicating.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm identified
on the left which is disrupted on the right. The activity on the right is somewhat lower voltage
and as the patient becomes drowsy, focal slowing characterized by occasional 3-5 hertz activity
is noted in the right posterior quadrant. Other features of drowsiness include generalized
background slowing and some bursts of FIRDA. There are also some bursts of sharply
contoured slowing in the right central temporal region with a generous field of spread in a T 4
maximum. Stage II sleep includes spindles which are relatively symmetric as well as some
snore arousals. Abundant POSTS are noted in sleep. photic simulation is initiated while the
patient is asleep, but there is a scant driving response identified.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent attenuation of the alpha rhythm on the right.
2. Occasional focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
3. Rare sharply contoured slowing or C4-T 4 sharp waves noted on the right.
CLINICAL The sharp waves are in the region of the patient's previous CVA.
The focal features are quite subtle, but support a structural process involving gray and white
matter.
