CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old gentleman with epilepsy, admitted after a stroke alert with slurred speech.  Past history of stroke, chronic right hemiparesis, renal failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and bilateral AKA.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, lisinopril, Lipitor, Coreg, warfarin, vitamin B.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was tachypneic and uncomfortable, but was able to participate in the study, which captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background from the right hemisphere demonstrates a medium amplitude diffusely slow pattern with 6-7 hertz theta activity and suggestion of a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  The left hemisphere demonstrates primarily 1-3 hertz rhythmic delta activity with a phase reversal at T1.  On occasion, there is a suggestion of some faster frequency activity in the left occipital region, and lambda.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to,
Continuous rhythmic slowing from the left hemisphere.
Sharply contoured slowing with T1 phase reversal.
Moderate slowing from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to a previous study from 2014.  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality in the left hemisphere, and with a sharply contoured slowing suggests a localization-related mechanism for seizures.
