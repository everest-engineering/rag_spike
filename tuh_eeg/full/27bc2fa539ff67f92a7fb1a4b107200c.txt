History:	73 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF CHEST PAIN, SOB, CHILLS, VOMIT. ALSO
INCREASE IN SZS OVER PAST WK.  URINARY INCONTINENCE, TONGUE BITE.  PMHX:
SZ, CVA, DM, HTN,
Medications:	Lamictal, Heparin, Insulin, ASA, Coreg, Amlodipine, Keppra
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  HR is 70 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
, Normal
Interpretation:
Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.  The lack of epileptiform
discharges on a routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
