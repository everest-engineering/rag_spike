CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed gentleman with childhood epilepsy,
tonic clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and confusion lasting minutes to hours.
Occasional clusters of seizures per day. Last seizure January 2011.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is
well organized, but the alpha rhythm is 7.5 Hz to 8 Hz. Features of drowsiness include
hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, followed
by POSTS. The patient starts to drift into stage 1 sleep with vertex waves during photic
stimulation and then vertex waves and brief spindles. Hyperventilation produces an
increase in rhythmicity of the background.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed. A
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important
consideration, a follow up study is suggested.
