History:	43 year old male with hx seizures, with last seizure ~ 15 yrs ago. He now has daily
dizziness for the past 2 months.
Medications:	Neurontin, Depakote, Clozapine, Risperdone
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Additional diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity is noted.  During
drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation produces no effect and is aborted early since patient reports dizziness.  Stepped
photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple
flash rates.  Additionally, patient reports dizziness during HV.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No epileptiform discharges
Other, reported dizziness during photic  stimulation and hyperventilation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG because of mild diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No
epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated,
repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.  Reported dizziness during
photic stimulation and hyperventilation with no abnormalities noted in EEG or a single EKG lead.
