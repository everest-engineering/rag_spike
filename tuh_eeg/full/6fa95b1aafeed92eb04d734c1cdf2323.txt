Medications:	Dilantin

None Asleep only
International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1fT2 electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present. Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
Diffuse, frontally maximal sharp waves with triphasic morphology are present throughout the recording. These waveforms demonstrate an anterior to posterior phase lag. These waveforms are not well seen on the right central and midtemporal region. No normal sleep architecture was present.
There is marked focal attenuation over the right midtemporal and central region compared to the left side. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There is no change in the background activity to auditory, tactile, or noxious stimuli. Heart rate was 84
Summary of Findings:
Triphasic waves, abundant, bilateral diffuse
Attenuation , continuous, marked, right temporal, mid, And central Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe, bilateral diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of frequent frontally-maxi mal triphasic waves and severe diffuse background slowing. These findings are indicative of a severe diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific, but suggestive of a metabolic origin. In addition there was a continuous voltage attenuation over the right midtemporal and central region, which is indicative of focal cortical injury or extra-axial	Â·
