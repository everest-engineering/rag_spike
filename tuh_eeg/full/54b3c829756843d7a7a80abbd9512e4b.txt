CLINICAL HISTORY:  Episodic blurry vision with vertigo lasting 1 to 2 minutes in a 56 -year-old male who has been having episodes of loss of consciousness and falling since 03/2012.  History of head injury 30 years ago and spasms.  Schizophrenia.
MEDICATIONS:  Haldol, Lithium, Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  As the patient becomes drowsy, temporal wicket was noted.  Other features of drowsiness included an increase in beta.  Some rolling eye movements were observed, but deeper stages of sleep were not identified.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving. Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be considered.
