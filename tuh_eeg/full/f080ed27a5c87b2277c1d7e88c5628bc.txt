LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of seizures.  Her last seizure occurred about 1 week ago while the patient was asleep.  The seizure was described as generalized tonic/clonic convulsion.  Of note, the patient was just diagnosed with colon cancer.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude of 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Bursts of diffuse high amplitude centrally predominant theta are captured.  Also symmetrical vertex sleep spindles and K complexes are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric driving at multiple flash frequencies. Excess diffuse beta is captured.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication affect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
