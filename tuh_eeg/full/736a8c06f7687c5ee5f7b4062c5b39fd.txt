AGE: 52 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 12/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and drowsy EEG #: 17S9
HISTORY:
52 y.o. male with a history of seizures referred for routine EEG .
He has had no seizures. He remains on Keppra 750mg bid. He agrees to do an EEG and if normal his physician may consider tapering
him off with the understanding that if he has more seizures we would have to keep him on medications.
Seizures
a past medical history of Hypertension; HIV Infection; Intracranial hemorrhage; Seizures; ESCRF (end stage chronic renal failure); Unspecified cerebral artery occlusion with cerebral infarction (2011); Cancer; Prostate

SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a	technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is asymmetric but reactive, and consists on the left is a well-organized pattern with of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient.	Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.
The record is slower on the right with continuous focal slowing, a slower alpha rhythm of 7-8 Hz, and intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.	The right focal slowing persists with slower activity noted on the right compared to the left. Right temporal arrhythmic delta was identified
Stage II Sleep is not captured
Focal slowing is present.	As described above EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Photic Stimulation :	Produces in asymmetric driving response, better demonstrated on the left
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 60 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG DUE to:
1. relatively continuous focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere maximum in the temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION :
This is an abnormal awake and drowsy routine EEG . No epileptiform features were seen.	The focal slowing described above is congruent with the previous right temporal hemorrhage. This EEG is improved compared to a study 2 years ago . No sharp waves were seen today
