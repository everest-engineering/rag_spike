AGE: 72 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/20/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: inpatient room 933 surgical ICU EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, confused adult patient
EEG #: 15-1706
HISTORY:
72 y.o. male with a history of cerebellar atrophy referred for routine EEG for screening for subclinical seizures.	HAD A QUESTIONABLE EPISODE. PT ? ASPIRATION,	WAS HYPOXIC AND HYPOTENSIVE LASTING 10-15 MINS. HR IN 30'S.
MEDICATIONS:
Current Outpatient Prescriptions:
cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12) 1,000 mcg tablet, Take 1 tablet by mouth daily.
HEPARIN, PROTONIX, PIPERACILLIN, MYCAMINE MICAFUNGIN, ASA, INSULIN, ATIVAN (11/19 3 PM 5 MG)
TECHNIQUE:
A	Bedside portable 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically challenging	record and included a single channel of EKG
EEG BACKGROUND :
The	background is obscured by diffuse muscle artifact.
During drowsiness, there is a diffuse beta pattern with muscle artifact
No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present.
However, these findings can be of secured by the muscle artifact EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is a very limited bedside portable EEG, identifying a beta pattern with excess muscle
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
If epilepsy is an important consideration for this patient, a followup study when the patient is able to cooperate is suggested.	This EEG is so limited that it cannot
support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
