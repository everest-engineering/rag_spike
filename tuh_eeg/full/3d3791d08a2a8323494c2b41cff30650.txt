History:	58 year old woman with change in mental status.
Medications:	propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes,
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low to-
moderate voltage mixture of polymorphic delta, theta, alpha and underriding fast activity with
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture
No focal slowing is present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 21-minute EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  In this patient, these findings are at least partially related to medication.  No clinical
or electrographic seizures are present.
