CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old male, now unresponsive after operation for incisional hernia.

MEDICATIONS: Narcan, Versed, Ancef, Zofran, Morphine, Cefazolin, Zofran

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is described by observers as being unresponsive, he appears to be lightly sedated with an 8.8 Hz alpha rhythm and subtle eye movement. More clear eye movement is associated with attenuation of the alpha rhythm. There appears to be some electrode artifact with a beta accentuation in the right frontal region. Tactile stimulation including painful stimulation does not activate the record. Sternal rub produces sternal rub artifact.

HR: 96 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed in the record. In addition, when the physician examines the patient at the bedside, eye opening and eye closure occur and the alpha is clearly reactive. Other possible causes for this patient's apparent responsiveness should be considered.
