REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of unresponsiveness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 38-year-old man, found unresponsive and complaining of sharp pain in the right flank and breathing difficulties with agonal breathing into the ED.  He vomited and then had a seizure.  UDS positive for oxycodone, opiates and cannabinoids.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record appears to reveal a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is also reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded mainly in sleep, stage 1 and stage 2.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Please note that the patient does easily drowse off throughout the entirety of the recording.  There is an excessive amount of beta throughout the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
Heart rate 100.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG mainly in sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG mainly in sleep.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the excessive beta may be due at least in part to medication effects sometimes seen with benzodiazepine or barbiturates.
