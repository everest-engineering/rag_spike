History:	72 yr male s/p pea code x 30 min 2/1.  ct. acute cva, chf comatose neuro eval.
propofol stopped prior eeg.
Medications:	Propofol drip stopped prior to EEG.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, comatose
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low
voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  Intermittent periods of diffuse attenuation for 1-3 seconds are noted.  No normal sleep
architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, severe diffuse
Attenuation
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  severe diffuse background slowing and absent alpha
rhythm.  These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of severe diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  This finding can be seen in diffuse hypoxic injury but can also be due at least in part
