INTRODUCTION: A routine EEG was performed using 10-20 electrode placement system With EKG electrodes as well as anterior temporal electrodes. Sleep was recorded, and photic stimulation was performed, but not hyperventilation.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Lovenox, Zocor.
MEDICAL PROBLEMS: None.
HISTORY: A 76-year-old male with history of left frontoparietal stroke and right-sided weakness, now presents for a left CEA.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: EEG opens to a well-formed 9 Hz background with 20 to 70 microvolt amplitude that is reactive to eye opening with a moderate amount of frontal central beta rhythm seen. Sleep stage I is seen with normal architecture. Activation procedures, photic stimulation are performed with no abnormal discharges. No hyperventilation is performed.
Heart rate is 94.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves at F7/T3 seen frequently at 2 to 4 Hz and 20 to 70 microvolts.
SEIZURES: None.
