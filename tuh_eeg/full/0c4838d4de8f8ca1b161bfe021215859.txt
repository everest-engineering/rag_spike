Medications:	CARBAMAZEPINE 200MG
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse, frontally predominant 5-10uV, 18-25Hz activity is also seen.
Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases
during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta
activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Excessive fast
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, excessive, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of mild diffuse background slowing.  This
finding is indicative of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
