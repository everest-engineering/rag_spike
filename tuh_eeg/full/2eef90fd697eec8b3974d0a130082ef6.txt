CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old right handed gentleman with multiple sclerosis,
diabetes, migraine headaches and episodic memory loss. Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Metformin, Pravastatin, Darvocet, Requip, ASA,
HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized
with symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. In the transition to drowsiness, age appropriate, rare
bursts of theta or delta are seen and a single BETS was identified. Vertex waves and
spindles were seen in stage II sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase In
amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation Is performed while the patient is
awakening from sleep but does elicit a driving response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits forage.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. There were no background features to
suggest an underlying disturbance of cerebral function. If epilepsy is an important
consideration, a repeat study may be of value.
