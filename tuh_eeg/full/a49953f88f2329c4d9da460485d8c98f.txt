History:	27 YR OLD MALE PRESENTS  WITH  HX OF SZ S/P MVA IN 2008. PT IS ON METHADONE FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE.
Medications:	Lamictal, Clonidine, Depakote, Neurontin Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:		International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm was seen to at best reach 9Hz  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies. No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed. There was no reactivity to auditory, tactile, or painful stimuli.  HR was 66
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mod	diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
