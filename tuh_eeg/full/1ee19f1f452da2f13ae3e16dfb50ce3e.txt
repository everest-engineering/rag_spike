CLINICAL HISTORY:   48 year old male with a history of tremor during sleep which began in July 2009.  The patient has a history of an MVA in June 2009 and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Valtrex, Nexium, Singulair, Metoprolol, Verapamil, Furosemide, Doxazosin, Flax seed oil, Omega fish oil.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low-voltage but wellÂ­ defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Features of drowsiness include an increase of beta.  Hyperventilation produces background slowing.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORR ELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and a low-voltage pattern is a normal finding.
