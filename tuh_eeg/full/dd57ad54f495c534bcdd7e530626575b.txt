CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed male with new onset seizure activity. Evaluate for alcohol-withdrawal seizures 4/3/2011.
MEDICATIONS: Serax, Keppra, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake through stage 2 sleep in a very drowsy individual.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall alpha rhythm is relatively low voltage, 12 Hz. Rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness characteristic 5-6 Hz is identified in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves and spindles are noted. The patient continues to have eye movement into stage 2 sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling back into stage 2 sleep, but does elicit scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are a number of normal variants in the EEG, including rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness. The overall background is very low voltage and there is generous beta. The generous beta may be due to the use of benzodiazepines. The low voltage background is not pathological in and of itself.
