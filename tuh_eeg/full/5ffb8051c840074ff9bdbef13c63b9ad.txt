History:	53 yo man who presents for a follow-up EEG. Pt has h/o seizures status post L
aneurysm clipping several years ago. Pt has been seizure free over 5 years, now
presenting with mood swings.
Medications:	Topamax, Keppra, Seroquel
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The background consists of very low voltage fast activity without clear AP gradient.  Patient remains
awake throughout the recording.
Subtle intermittent moderate amplitude polymorphic delta activity is captured over the left anterior
quadrant.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Low voltage, severe
Beta, continuous diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, moderate, left anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake-only 21-minute EEG due to subtle intermittent focal left anterior
moderate slowing. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  When compared to prior EEGs, left anterior focal
slowing has been previously reported.
