AGE: 35 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 11/03/2015
RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: outpatient
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, awake and asleep EEG #: 15-1621
HISTORY:
35 y.o. male with a history of complex partial seizures, mental retardation, craniotomy (scar T4, C4, Cz, C3) referred for routine EEG.
MEDICATIONS:
Carbamazepine
SEDATION: None TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The waking background is characterized by the presence of a well organized symmetric mixture of alpha and beta frequencies, with a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR). The normal anterior-to-posterior gradient of frequency and amplitude is present.
During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and
fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.
Sleep is characterized by normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes. Slow wave sleep was not captured .
No generalized slowing is present.
There is frequent right hemispheric polymorphic slowing. There is occasional independent left hemispheric polymorphic slowing.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:
Hyperventilation : Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation : Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21
flashes per second (fps) does not produce any EEG changes.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 78 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal awake and asleep routine EEG due to:
1. Frequent right hemispheric polymorphic slowing
2. Occasional independent left hemispheric polymorphic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings are nonspecific indicators of right > left hemispheric dysfunction.
