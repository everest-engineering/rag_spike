History:	42 YR FEMALE WITH NEW ONSET SZ. LEFT SIDE TWITCHING FACIAL.

Medications:	Phenobarbital, Xanax, Topamax
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excess diffuse 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the left mid and anterior temporal region.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
induces photomyogenic response at 5Hz, but no photic driving.  HR 78
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal
Interpretation:
This is am ABNORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep, due to intermittent focal slowing in the
left anterior and midtemporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific.  The excess beta may be seen with the use of benzodiazepine
and/or barbituates.
