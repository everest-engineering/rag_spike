STUDY DATE:  01/15/2013 to 01/16/2013 for a total of 24 hours.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old man with history of coronary artery disease, schizophrenia, COPD, and cocaine use presents with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, phenobarbital, propofol.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using standard 10/20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is some T4 electrode artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or normal frontal central beta.  Overall, there is a diffuse beta that is seen continuously and underneath appears to have diffuse slowing.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  During the recording, the patient is stimulated and there appears to be reactivity with muscle artifact.  Overall, the background has remained unchanged.  No activating procedures were performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen at F7tT3 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz, amplitude of 20-30 microvolts seen continuously 2-4 Hz with an overlying diffuse beta.
Seizures:  None seen in the last 24 hours.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region in addition to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen in the past 24 hours.  Again, the diffuse beta may be due to medication effect.  These findings are reported to the primary team.
