WANING. ? DEMENTIA. PT HAD ICH IN JULY 2014. PMH: HTN.
HEAD CT NEGATIVE
Medications:	Metformin, Asa, Lovenox
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 72
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
