REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 41-year-old mentally retarded man with a history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with __________ anterior temporal single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, Stage I and Stage II sleep.  Activating procedures reveal no abnormal discharges.  Overall the recording is fairly normal.  There is at times some asymmetric vertex waves seen more on the right than the left, and some beta discharges seen over the left central region which appears slightly atypical, but not a clear pathology.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The asymmetric vertex waves and beta may be due to the known cortical malformation the patient has.
