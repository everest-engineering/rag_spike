CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old male with recurrent tonic-clonic seizures today.

MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Ativan, Norvasc

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient was reported to have had a seizure shortly before the EEG. He is intubated and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern of generalized background slowing with lower voltage theta. The frontal regions have more delta and there is a slight asymmetry with a bit more faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.

HR: 90 bpm.

IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Subtle asymmetry with a pattern that is a bit slower on the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed in this EEG. Additional EEG monitoring will be undertaken to quantitate additional seizures for this obtunded patient
