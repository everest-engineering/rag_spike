REASON FOR STUDY:  Follow-up of seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 63-year-old woman with a history of right frontal meningioma resection and multiple medical problems who is here for a follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax and Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen throughout the recording.  The patient recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this record is similar to the one performed on February 28, 2012 in which some left anterior temporal and frontal slowing were seen.
