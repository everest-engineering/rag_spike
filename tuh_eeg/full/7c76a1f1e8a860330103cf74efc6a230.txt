CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 64-year-old woman with visual obscuration, spots, dark clouds, feeling as if everyone is following her and a feeling of confusion.  Found last night with a seizure recognized by nurse, characterized by left arm stiffening with rhythmic movements of the hands.  Renal failure, chronic encephalopathy, and longstanding visual hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zofran, Zosyn, daptomycin, Percocet, Coreg, losartan, many others, and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Patient seemed to be relatively somnolent.  She did not endorse any visual hallucinations during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern with a slow alpha rhythm of approximately 5-6 Hz.  Eye movement artifact is noted with alerting.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, the EEGs considerably slower with bursts of delta.  Rare triphasic waves were noted in the background.
Heart rate 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Occasional triphasic waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to a previous study performed in 2013 for similar complaints.  However, there is a little bit more theta in this record.  When this patient is metabolically stable, consideration for a more prolonged study in search of epileptiform activity is suggested.
