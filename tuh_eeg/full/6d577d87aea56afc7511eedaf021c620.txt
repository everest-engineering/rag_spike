History:	89 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O S/P FALL WITH H/O INCREA FEELING
OF FATIGUE X 4 MOS.  RT TEMP LOBE MASS W/SIGN VASOGENIC. NOW WITH
CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS.
Medications:	Dexamethasone, Keppra
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
Moderate to severe continuous right hemispheric slowing, more prominent in the frontal region (F8)
No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 48
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing in the
right hemisphere maximal in the frontotemporal region.  This finding is indicative of  focal cerebral
dysfunction in this region, likely structural in origin.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are
