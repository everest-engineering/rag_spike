History:	79 year old male with change in mental status after intracerebral hemorrhage.
Medications:	None
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
There is a fragmentary 7-8Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the right. There is no posterior dominant
rhythm on the left.  Background activity was characterized by diffuse low voltage theta activity with
absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture
was present.
Superimposed on the diffuse theta there is continuous medium amplitude focal delta activity noted
over the left hemisphere.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, bilateral diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left hemispheric
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm, and
focal left hemisphere slowing. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate
diffuse cerebral dysfunction with a possible structural brain injury in the left hemisphere.  No clinical
or electrographic seizures are present.
