CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed female with epilepsy, evaluate for
subclinical seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 7
Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The
overall background is well organized. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of
the alpha rhythm. There are also posterior flow waves of youth and head-rocking
artifact. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Hyperventilation produces some
paroxysmal rhythmic slowing but no generalized spike and wave activity.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Unlike the EEG 2 months ago when the patient had a
cluster of seizures, there is no generalized spike and wave activity and there Is no
background slowing.
