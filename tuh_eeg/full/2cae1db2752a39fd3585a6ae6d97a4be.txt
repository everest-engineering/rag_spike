History: 15 YO FEMALE WHO IS 5 MONTHS PREGNANT. WITH CC OF MYOCLONIC JERKS
HAPPENING FOR SEVERAL YRS BUT GOT WORSE WITH USE OF ABILIFY .
Medications: Topamax
Sedation: None
EEG Type: Routine. Awake & drowsy
Technique: International  10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 2S40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm. Which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening. Symmetric 5-15uV. 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions. During drowsiness. the background slows to central theta activity. Frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present. No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation Is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving. HR IS 70 BPM.
Summary of Findings:
NORMAL
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep. The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine.
