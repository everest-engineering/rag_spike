History:	49 YR MALE WITH PMHX: OF RIGHT ICH/ WITH ETOH INTOXICATION, HTN,
TRAUMATIC HYPHEMA.  FOLLOW UP EEG TO STOP KEPPRA.  1 HR STUDY
Medications:	KEPPRA, PREDNISOLONE, OCULAR, CYCLOMYDRIL, LISINOPRIL, PROTONIX,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Extended, 40-60 min
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the F8/T4 region during wakefulness, increasing
during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL 1 hour awake, drowsy and asleep EEG because of continuous focal slowing
in the right anterior temporal region.  This finding is consistent with the known hemorrhage.
