CLINICAL HISTORY:  Left carotid stenosis, status post stroke, for carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Etomidate, fentanyl, Versed, propofol, Decadron, remifentanil, sevoflurane.
INTRODUCTION:  A 4.5-hour EEG was performed in the OR using standard CEA montage with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was intubated and sedated prior to the study. Physician was available throughout the EEG, and remote 1:1 physician review was employed from 8:26 to 10:52 a.m.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the recording begins, the patient has received anesthetic medications.  The EEG demonstrates an asymmetry with significant disruption of faster frequency in the left hemisphere relevant to the right and underlying arrhythmic delta.  As the level of anesthesia changes, so does the asymmetry with a consistent pattern of a lower voltage, more suppressed pattern noted on the left.
The carotid dissection commences and is completed prior to 10:16.
The clamp was placed at 10:17.  No additional focal features were noted with placement of the clamp.
The patient developed an increase in blood pressure at 10:29.  The patient received a bolus of propofol, which produced a dramatic attenuation of the EEG and then a gradual burst suppression pattern.  The operative team was notified.
Anesthetic medications were adjusted and, over the remaining 20 minutes, the EEG returned to the previous pattern with a continuous pattern with mixed theta, delta in a previously described asymmetry.
The clamp was removed at 11:43 and patency was confirmed by Doppler.  As the patient's level of anesthesia lightened, the EEG demonstrated an increase in richer, theta activity and some beta activity, but the asymmetry remained.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This 4.5-hour intraoperative EEG monitoring session was remarkable for -
An asymmetric pattern, which did not change with manipulation of the carotid.
A transient suppression and discontinuous pattern with the use of anesthetic medications.
I do not need a clinical correlation.  I just need that.
