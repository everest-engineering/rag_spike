CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed male with head trauma, past history of
traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, tonic-clonic seizures, last seizure 07/10/2010,
right skull defect.

MEDICATIONS: Zoloft

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is arrhythmic delta activity in
the right temporal region. In addition, there are occasional bursts of rhythmic higher
amplitude 4-6 Hz activity in the right frontal region, some of which is sharply contoured.
The right frontal focal slowing in an underlying breach rhythm is accentuated by
hyperventilation. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. During photic stimulation, a breach artifact is noted, and despite this there is a suspicious underlying F4 sharp wave.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere, characterized by higher amplitude
rhythmic theta as well as disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Probable underlying right frontal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right.
The features described above may have been accentuated by this patient's breach
rhythm.
