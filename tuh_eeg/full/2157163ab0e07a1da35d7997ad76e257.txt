CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with 3-month history of worsening headaches with blurry vision, nausea, changes in hearing, or photophobia.  Past history of epilepsy with left temporal surgery at Jefferson.  SUNCT-  Left-sided headaches following epilepsy surgery in 2005.
MEDICATIONS:  Effexor, Klonopin, and gabapentin as well as Plaquenil.
INTRODUCTION:  An awake and drowsy 24-minute digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  There was a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the record.  Most impedances were under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1, T2 electrodes. A breach rhythm was noted.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is low voltage with scant underlying alpha rhythm.  In early drowsiness and hyperventilation, subtle underlying left mid temporal focal slowing with rhythmic theta delta was identified.  Breach rhythm is characterized by accentuation of amplitude in this region.  A single, broadly contoured left mid temporal sharp wave was noted.
Hyperventilation accentuated the underlying focal slowing and breach rhythm as described above.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.  Heart rate:  70 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to
Focal slowing, left mid temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm described above is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  There was a single, broadly contoured left temporal sharp wave, which in this context cannot be considered insignificant.  The absence of a well-defined alpha rhythm can be seen in a minority of patients and is not considered to be pathological.
