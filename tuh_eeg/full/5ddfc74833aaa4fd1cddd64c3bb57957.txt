History:	77 year old woman who presents with excessive drowsiness.
Medications:	NO AED
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 8-9Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric
sleep spindles and K complexes appear.  Patient rapidly transitions in and out of sleep.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Other, rapid transitioning to sleep
Sleep, stage 2
Interpretation:
This is a minimally abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to slower than expected
posterior dominant rhythm. This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is
etiologically nonspecific.  In this case it could be related to an excessively drowsy patient, given
how rapidly the patient transitions in and out of sleep - please correlate  clinically.
