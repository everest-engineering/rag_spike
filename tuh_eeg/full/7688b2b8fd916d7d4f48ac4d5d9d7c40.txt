CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old male with melanoma, mets, and status post brain surgery who presented with a generalized tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed  in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an asymmetry in the frontal central beta seen more on the right.  There is no normal posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz to 9 Hz is seen over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves and slowing are seen at T4/F8 continuously throughout the recording with associated breech.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz are seen throughout the recording.  In addition, there is increased diffuse beta seen at times.
SEIZURES:  At times during the recording the frontal sharp waves which appear to become more rhythmic in a pattern of 1-3 Hz and at times evolve to faster frequencies and then stop and start.  This is most consistent with small electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal sharp waves and slow waves.
Intermittent electrographic procedures in the setting of a breech.
Diffuse slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy, with electrographic seizures arising from the right anterior temporal region.  There is also evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability, which is
consistent with a known tumor.  These findings were communicated to the team as soon as the EEG was performed.
