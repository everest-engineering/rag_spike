History:	60 YR FEMALE S/P GBM, CHEMO RX CRANI.   RETURNS TO TUH WITH 2 SZS.
PT HAS RECENTLY BEEN MORE SOMNOLENT 1-2 WKS
Medications:	DEPACON
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
There is no clear PDR or AP gradient.  Background consists almost entirely of low voltage irregular
4-7Hz activity.  States changes are noted, but not typical sleep architecture.
Continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the right posterior quadrant.  Continuous
periodic and semi-periodic sharp waves with aftergoing slow waves (PLEDs and quasi-PLEDs) are
noted over the right posterior quadrant with a repetition rate of 0.5-1 Hz.  Maximal scalp negativity
occurs over T6/P4 lead.  No electrographic seizures are captured.
HR was 90
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, moderate
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, right posterior quadrant
PLEDs (periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges), continuous, right posterior quadrant
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and asleep EEG due to continuous moderate right posterior quadrant
focal slowing and right posterior quadrant periodic and periodic lateralized epileptiform
discharges. These findings are indicative of a focal structural, potentially epileptogenic, lesion in
the right posterior quadrant, consistent with the known lesion  No clinical or electrographic seizures
