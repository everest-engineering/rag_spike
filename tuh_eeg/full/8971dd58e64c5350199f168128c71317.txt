History:	22 YO FEMALE HAD FIRST SZ 3 WEEKS AGO.W/ LOC, ONSET " FELT LIKE AN
ANXIETY ATTACK", LASTING ABOUT 2 - 4 MIN. PT WOKE ON THE GROUND IT
TOOK 5 - 6 MIN TO FIND BASELINE.  PT STAYED AT OSH "NAZARETH" 3 DAY,
MRI, CT, EEG, EKG.
Medications:	KEPPRA
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Limited waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Excessive symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal
over bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity,
frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent.  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and
symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at
flash rates from 15 to 17 fps.  HR is 60
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and mainly asleep.  No epileptiform discharges were
present. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
