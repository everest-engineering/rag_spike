.CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 71-year-old male, with CHF, recurrent syncope but new episode of right arm shaking The patient was standing, and, slid to floor with the event. Amnestic for event. .  Past history of stroke and head trauma 1 week prior to the admission.
MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, amiodarone, warfarin, and loperamide.
INTRODUCTION:  A 20-minute digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This EEG captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of diffuse background theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm.  Mu activity was noted at 9.2 Hz in the central regions, but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Heart rate:  Irregular, 60-72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
excess background theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen. No focal features noted.   If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study when the patient is out of the hospital may be of value.
