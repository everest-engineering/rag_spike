History:	26 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O LOC WITH WITNESSED SHAKING FOR
UNKNOWN TIME, NOTED TO BE IN RESP DISTRESS ALONG WITH 2ND
EPISODE OF CONVULSION. PT HAS HAD PRIOR EEG. PT POS FOR BENZOS
Medications:	Propofol
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by an alpha rhythm, which at best reaches 9Hz  Symmetric 5-
15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed
50-75 uV, 5-7Hz activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.
During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more
prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes intermittent.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was  66.  There is an episode of
head shaking back and forth for ~ 4 minutes with no EEG correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, left temporal, mid
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ambulatory EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal  region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific. In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.  The episode described above
had no eeg correlate and is supportive of an non-epileptic etiology for the event.
