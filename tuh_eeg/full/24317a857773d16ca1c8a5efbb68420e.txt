CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 54-year-old woman with possible meningitis versus osteomyelitis.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was somnolent with eye movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates marked background slowing with a pattern with prominent theta and delta.  At some points, there is a suggestion of a 7.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.
EKG lead: not functioning correctly.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  This EEG supports a significant, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function, which may be due to many different causes such as a diffuse brain problem or even medication effect.
