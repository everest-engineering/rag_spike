CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 31-year-old male with alcohol abuse, depression, hypertension.  Patient has a history of a burn injury over face, head, and body.  Now with seizures attributed to alcohol abuse with generalized shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, Percocet, Valium.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  There were impedance issues as this was a patient who was recovering from cranial and facial burn injury.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage  frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation produces scant slowing.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Deeper stages of sleep were not achieved.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  This EEG is improved compared to a previous study which was performed while the patient was sedated with an Ativan drip.  This is a normal awake pattern.
