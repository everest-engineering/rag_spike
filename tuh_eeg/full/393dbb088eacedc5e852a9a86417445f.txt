CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old, right-handed woman with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, breakthrough seizures with sleep deprivation.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, Ambien.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This was a routine outpatient EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms with the exception of the T1-T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Rare lambda was noted.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response, but no spike and wave activity.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG primarily in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Generalized spike and wave activity has not been seen for this individual since 2007.
