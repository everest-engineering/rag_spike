CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old male with teenage onset, refractory tonic-clonic seizures with recent severe tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Continuous 24-hour digital video EEG monitoring was undertaken using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG, seizure and spike detection software. .
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The multi day recording.
Day 1:  October 27th through 28th, in wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Intermittent excess theta was noted while awake.  In drowsiness, intermittent theta was noted.  Vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and posts were noted in stage 2 sleep.  Sleep was disrupted.
Epileptiform detection:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This first 24 hours of EEG monitoring was remarkable for the absence of epileptiform activity, but intermittent background theta.
October 28th through 29th:  Introduction:  Continuous video EEG monitoring continues.  The patient's Keppra dose was reduced.  No seizures were noted by the patient, clinical staff, or computer.
Background:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  There is intermittent background theta noted in wakefulness with slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm while awake.
Stage 2 sleep included spindles.  There was not a great deal of deeper stages of sleep.
Epileptiform Detections:  None.
Electrographic Seizures:  None.
Heart Rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION/CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This 2nd day of continuous video EEG monitoring was remarkable for excess background theta and a paucity of deeper stages of sleep, but no epileptiform features.
