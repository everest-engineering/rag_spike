CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male with epilepsy, glioblastoma, admitted with new right-sided weakness, hypertension, asthma. coronary artery disease and head trauma prior to 2007.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, ASA, Metoprolol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation. Photic stimulation was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Given the history provided, there should be a craniotomy defect, although none is reported by the technician and there appears to be a breech rhythm. There is nearly continuous left anterior temporal focal slowing and left anterior temporal sharp waves. The sharp waves are noted in relaxed wakefulness. The focal slowing becomes nearly continuous as the patient becomes somewhat drowsy. Characteristics of the focal slowing include arrhythmic delta activity in the left frontotemporal region with intermittent rhythmic 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.

HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left anterior temporal focal slowing with destruction of faster frequency activity and rhythmic theta.
2. Left anterior temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Similar features were noted in this patient's previous EEG several years ago. supports a structural process on the left and a localization related mechanism for seizures.
