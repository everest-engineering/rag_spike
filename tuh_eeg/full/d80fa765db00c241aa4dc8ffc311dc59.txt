CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed gentleman with history of heroine addiction, one year history of palpitations, numbness right arm and leg, intermittent loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing, particularly in the right central region.  Wicket activity is noted, particularly on the left. Features of drowsiness include an increase in theta.  Vertex waves and spindles are noted in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic slowing.   Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is transitioning in and out of stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. There are rare, right central sharp waves noted, as well as a single posteriorly predominant spike at P4.  There are really only the two C4 spikes and the posterior spike.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting slowing, a little bit more so on the right central region on the left.
Two right central and one occipital, right greater than left, sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The sharp waves are in the region of this patient's cerebrovascular disease.  The shifting slowing is a nonspecific finding which can be
seen in the context of underlying ischemic cerebrovascular disease.  Overall, this was otherwise a sharply contoured, but otherwise unremarkable background.
