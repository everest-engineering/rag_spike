History:	50 year old man found down.
Medications:	Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Awake & asleep, portable
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, asleep, obtunded
Description:
There is no PDR or AP gradient.  With stimulation and during arousals the background consists of
diffuse attenuated slow delta activity.  During periods of quiescence the background consists of
diffuse frontally predominant sleep-spindle-like waveforms.
No electrographic seizures are present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, moderate-to-severe
No electrographic seizures
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL portable 21-minute EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse slowing. This
finding is indicative of moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
nonspecific.  There is clear background reactivity.  It is a good prognostic indicator.
