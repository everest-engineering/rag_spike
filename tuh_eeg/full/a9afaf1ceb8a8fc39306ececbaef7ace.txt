HISTORY: 65-year-old male with a history of epilepsy, status post right subdural hematoma With an area of encephalomalacia, currently seizure-free.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, nifedipine, Neurontin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and Photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm. A subtle breech rhythm is noted with higher amplitude activity in the right posterior quadrant than the left.
The overall EEG is of low voltage, but there is focal delta noted in the right hemisphere with 1 to 2.5 Hz delta in the right central region and sometimes posterior temporal region as well. The focal slowing is accentuated by hyperventilation. Drowsiness also seems to increase the focal slowing in terms of field of spread and its persistence. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to focal delta in the right hemisphere, particularly in the central and posterior temporal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies. No epileptiform features were identified in this record. Overall, this EEG is significantly improved compared to the many studies since this patients original head trauma.
