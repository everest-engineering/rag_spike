CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old right-handed man who presented with a history of prostate cancer and prostatectomy, alcohol abuse, and status post change in mental status and weakness, found to be hypotensive.
MEDICATIONS:  Folic acid, Golytely, Protonix, and thiamine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the entirety of the recording, there is diffuse temporalis and jaw muscle artifact that failed to subside for almost the entirety of the recording.  There were limited periods where he relaxed his jaw and some of the EEG could be clearly seen.  This is a very limited EEG due to this artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record appears to have a background that is diffusely slow with no normal posterior dominant rhythm.  No comments can be made about clear frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures did not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  General slow waves at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  126.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please again note that this was a limited EEG, and for any definitive abnormal findings, a repeated EEG with sedation or paralysis would be helpful.
