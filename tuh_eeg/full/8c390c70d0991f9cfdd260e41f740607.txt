CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old male who presented with acute left sided weakness and slurred speech.  He has had past history of stroke.  Evaluate for seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha squeak was noted.
In the transition to drowsiness, there is an increase in background theta and there is a small amount of isolated, somewhat sharply contoured temporal theta or left hemispheric theta noted in drowsiness.  There is also some single channel artifact noted at T2.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:  Shifting temporal theta, left more so than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The asymmetry and occasional left temporal theta are outside of the range of normal for an adult of this age.  No definitive epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
