Medications:	ZOSYN, NOREPINEPHRINE, INSULIN
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
No posterior dominant rhythm was present.  Background activity was characterized by a completely
attenuated background with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of frequencies.
No normal sleep architecture was present.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic
seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Continuous eye movement artifact was noted.  HR was 104 and irregular
Summary of Findings:
Attenuation, continuous, marked
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  marked background attenuation and absent alpha rhythm.
These findings are consistent with marked diffuse cortical dysfunction  which may be due to toxic,
metabolic or anoxic encephalopathy or bilateral structural lesions.
