CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed male with a tonic clonic seizure with incontinence associated with cocaine abuse.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness this a very low voltage EEG with 10.7 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by frontal central theta, followed by POSTS and vertex waves.  Spindles are noted in brief stage II sleep.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in the amplitude of the background.  The patient is falling asleep during photic stimulation.

HR:    50 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal low voltage EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features noted.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
