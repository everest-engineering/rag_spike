History:	50 year old woman with rapidly progressive cognitive decline.
Medications:	no AEDs
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, asleep
Continuous bedside video-EEG monitoring
Continuous EEG monitoring was performed for  ~22 hours from 4/21/2015 to 4/22/2015.   Nursing-
initiated event buttons were correlated with clinical behavior.   Ongoing raw EEG data was
reviewed at least twice daily by the EEG team for detection of seizures and changes in EEG
patterns.   All automatically detected events were reviewed in detail by the attending neurologist.
# Push button events
Description of pushbutton events
Description:
The background consists of 6-8 Hz moderate amplitude polymorphic theta activity posteriorly with
poor AP gradient and excess diffuse polymorphic theta activity.  Patient moves nearly continuously
throughout the recording.  About 2-2.5 hours of sleep is captured in this 22 hour recording epoch.
No clearly normal sleep architecture is present except for vertex-like waveforms.
Summary of Findings:
Artifact, movement, abundant
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Other, only sleeps for ~2-2.5 hrs, sleep is fragmented
Disorganization
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL ~22 hours continuous video EEG due to mild background slowing and
disorganization. These findings are etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction.  Only ~ 2-2.5 of fragmented sleep is captured in this recording epoch - sleep is
fragmented and sleep architecture is not normal.  These findings were conveyed to the primary
