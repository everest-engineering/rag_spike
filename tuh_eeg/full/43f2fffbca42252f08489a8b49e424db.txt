CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old woman with left temporal abnormality and a history of epilepsy, depression, and anxiety here for evaluation of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Neurontin, Senna, Ativan.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen rarely at F7/T3 at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild left anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long term video monitoring EEG was performed for 24 hours using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software was used to review the EEG, along with seizure detection software, patient's alarms, and nurses noted events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz with normal frontal central beta.  No activating procedure were performed.  The patient was recorded in stage I, stage II, as well as sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
EVENT:  The patient pressed the alarm on 3 occasions as a test, but no actual events occurred.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video long-term EEG was performed for 24 hours from 05/15/2012 to 05/16/2012 using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software was used to review the EEG in addition to patient alarms and nurse's events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm which reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  This is day 2 of recording.  There were no seizures or patient events noted.
Clinical correlation and impression will be dictated at the end of the whole report.
