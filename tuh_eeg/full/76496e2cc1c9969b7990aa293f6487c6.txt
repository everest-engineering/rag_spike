CLINICAL HISTORY:   79 year old woman with episodes of blurry vision, loss of balance and feeling as if she is not quite herself.  Impaired memory.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Theophylline,  Digoxin, Temazepam,  Meclizine, Fosamax, Metoprolol, Benicar, Lorazepam, Albuterol, Spiriva

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a prominent, interhemispheric asymmetry.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 9 Hz reaching amplitudes of 50 microvolts on the left but often as small as 10 microvolts on the right. The alpha rhythm is best represented in the temporal regions and that is where the right to left asymmetry is most remarkable.   The activity in the central regions bilaterally is relatively low voltage. There are occasional bursts of arrhythmic delta activity on the right and in drowsiness there are bursts of paroxysmal bilateral delta.   Photic stimulation elicits scant driving bilaterally at faster flash frequencies.

HR:	80 bpm and irregular


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.	Amplitude asymmetry with relative disruption of faster frequency activity on the right particularly in the temporal region.
2.	Occasional right temporal slowing.
3. 	Occasional bursts of bilateral paroxysmal slowing.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right involving gray matter and is s congruent with the MRI. No epileptiform features were observed.  The heart rate is  irregular.
