CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 42-year-old woman, group home resident, with cognitive impairment, hypertension, and an increase in seizure activity.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Zoloft, Dilantin, and Tegretol.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory EEG with impedances under 5 kilohms. Hyperventilation was initiated, but was not completed and the study was somewhat limited as the patient was feeling lightheadedness and reported that she had not eaten in 24 hours.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an unusual and dynamic pattern.  Some sections of the record are lower voltage more organized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 8-9 hertz.  Other sections demonstrate higher amplitude, more rhythmic, slower theta frequency activity.  There is a suggestion of some fast activity in the left hemisphere, but none that clearly developed.  Intermittent somewhat irregular bursts were noted in the background.  Limited hyperventilation did produce some paroxysmal slowing.

Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  When viewed with frequency analysis, the photic stimulation is asymmetric, more vigorous on the left.

HEART RATE: 96 bpm, increasing to 108 with hyperventilation.

IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Intermittent paroxysmal slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clearly epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function.  Metabolic features as well as a chronic static encephalopathy, or an early developmental cause for epilepsy could all contribute to the pattern described above.  Subtle focal features may be correlated with imaging
