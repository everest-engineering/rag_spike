REASON FOR STUDY:  Numbness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 55-year-old woman with left hand numbness for 2-3 days occurring multiple times per day.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, heparin, Protonix, lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5-9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges: Intermittent focal slowing seen at T5/T3 occasionally at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Seizures: None.
Heart rate: 66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to intermittent left posterior temporal and parietal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left parietal and posterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
