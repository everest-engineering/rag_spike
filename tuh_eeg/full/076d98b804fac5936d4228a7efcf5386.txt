LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of neurosarcoidosis who now presents with an increase in her seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Keppra, Lamictal, Plavix, aspirin, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  The EEG technologist was unable to get all of the impedances under 5 due to a weave present in the patient's hair.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation is not performed.  Sinus tachycardia is captured in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 21-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
