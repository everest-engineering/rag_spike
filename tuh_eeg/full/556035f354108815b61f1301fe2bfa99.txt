History:	47 year old man with a history of seizures secondary to a prior TBI.  There is cranial
skull defect over the left.
Medications:	Depakote
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 11.5 Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow
waves appear diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
Subtle excess theta activity and underriding low amplitude fast activity is noted over the left
frontocentral region.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and exacerbates focal
slowing in the left frontocentral region.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild, left central
Breach artifact, left central
No epileptiform discharges
No stage 2 sleep
Interpretation:
This is an subtly ABNORMAL awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG due to subtle mild left
frontocentral slowing. This finding is indicative of a focal structural lesion in the left frontocentral
region and is consistent with patient's history of a prior craniotomy.  Breach rhythm is secondary to
the skull defect.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If
clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide additional information.
