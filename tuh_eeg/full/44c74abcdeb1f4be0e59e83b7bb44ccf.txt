History: 23 year old woman with medically refractory seizures. now presents with breakthrough seizures.
Medications: Vimpat Ativan
Sedation:
EEG Type: Awake & asleep, portable
Technique: international 10·20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes

Patient is asleep throughout the majority of the recording. During very brief wakefulness, no posterior
dominant rhythm or frequently amplitude gradient are identified. Maximal waking Is a
mixture of theta and delta. During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, POSTS. Sleep spindles and K·
complexes are observed.
Frequent generalized high amplitude frontally-maximal spikes are present. They are often imbedded
within K-complexes or followed by sleep spindles. A single brief (-10 seconds) electrographic seizure is
captured out of stage II sleep. It starts with frontally predominant generalized fast activity that rapidly
evolves into-3 Hz generalized frontally predominant polyspike with after going slowing waves. It lasts
for-2 seconds and Is followed by diffuse voltage attenuation that lasts -15 seconds.
Video demonstrates a patient who wakes up and reaches for the EEG electrodes.

Sleep, stage 2, nearly continuous
Interpretation
This Is a very abnormal mostly asleep and briefly awake 23-minute EEG due to frequent generalized
epileptiform discharges and a single brief electrographic seizure. These findings are consistent with a
generalized mechanism of epilepsy.
