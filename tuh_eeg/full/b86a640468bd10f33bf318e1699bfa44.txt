CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old male with epilepsy with question mesiotemporal sclerosis in the right temporal region.

MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Drowsiness is characterized by synchronous rhythmic slowing. There is a subtle asymmetry noted in hyperventilation with a little bit higher rhythmic activity on the left than the right, but then there is also some head rocking artifact on the left.  Wicket is observed as the patient transitions in and out of a drowsy pattern.  Hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing is also noted.  Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and sleep and produces driving, but no pathological features.

HR:    84 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
