INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in  the lab using  standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This Is a greater than 20-minute EEG with acceptable Impedances aside from T1  and T2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there was a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness Is characterized by attenuation of the background rhythm with stage II sleep including spindles. The patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation with features of stage II sleep, but there was a driving response when the patient was alerted.
Heart rate 72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
