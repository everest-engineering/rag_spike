CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed woman with schizophrenia and a history of seizures, as well as pseudoseizures, now with auditory hallucinations.

MEDICATIONS:  None

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Minimal drowsiness was noted by a decrease in eye movement and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.

HR:    96 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
