History:	57 YR FEMALE WITH PMHX: CAD, COPD, HTN,  WITH CHANGE IN MS. RIGHT
EYE GAZE DEVIATION. AROUND 7:30 AM VOCAL BUT CONFUSED BLURRY
VISION COULD HARDLY SEE FOR 1 WK.  CT ACUTE INF OF POSTERIOR LEFT
PARIETAL LOBE INTO LEFT PCA  CHRONIC SM VES DS
Medications:	ASA, LOVENOX, INSULIN, PLAVIX, FAMOTIDINE, MOXIFLOXACIN, INSULIN,
XANAX, LOPRESSOR
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes and EKG electrodes, awake
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a PDR that at best reaches 7Hz.  Mild excessive diffuse 5-
15uV, 13-25Hz activity is present.  Frequent 50-75uV, 4-7Hz waves are interspersed throughout the
recording.  Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA) is seen.  During drowsiness, the background
slows to central theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm
attenuates and becomes intermittent.
continuous polymorphic delta activity is present in the left parietal at P3 region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Frequent focal spikes and polyspikes are present in the left parietal
region, with phase reversal and amplitude maximum at P3.  At times these become very rhythmic
but reveal no clear evolution.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR was 60
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, continuous, left parietal
Spikes, intermittent, left parietal, with polyspikes and at times rhythmic
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity)
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake EEG because of continuous focal slowing and frequent rhythmic
spikes in the left parietal region.  This findings are indicative of a focal structural lesion with a
potentially epileptogenic focus.  Please note that the spikes become rhythmic at times but do not
clearly evolve. If  there is clinical concern for subclinical seizures a prolonged 24 EEG should be
performed.  In addition there is mild to moderate diffuse background slowing.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
