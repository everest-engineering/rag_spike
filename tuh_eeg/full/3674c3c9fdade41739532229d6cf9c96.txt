History:	49 YR FEMALE WITH MENTAL ISSUES, SEIZURES CPS INTRACTABLE,
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES.  CANNOT KEEP PT AWAKE  NO INFORMATION
REALLY CAME WITH PT. OTHER THEN MEDS.  PER PT HAS SZS SINCE AGE 2.
AND SHAKING NOT RELATED TO SZS.
Medications:	Carbamazepine, Depakote.
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity
, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent. During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to moderate voltage 2-4Hz
activity, and symmetric
No focal slowing is present.  Single sharp wave seen at F7 with an atypical field that
spreads to the right frontal region.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second
(fps) does not produce any effect.  HR was 90  The patient has an two episodes of sudden
arousal from sleep and shaking with no EEG correlate.
Summary of Findings:
Sharp waves, single, left frontotemporal
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake, drowsy, and sleep EEG because of a single left frontotemporal
sharp wave, which is suggestive of an epileptogenic focus in that region.  No clinical or
electrographic seizures are present.
