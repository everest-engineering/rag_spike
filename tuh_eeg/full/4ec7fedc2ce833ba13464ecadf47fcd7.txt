History:	45 Y O MALE WITH HX:SEIZURES. NEW BREAKTHROUGH SZ. FOCAL RELATED
SEIZURE IN SLEEP.
Medications:	Keppra, TPM, Elavil
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Continuous (inpt, video), 24 hrs
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
drowsy, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric diffuse beta activity is present, maximal over bilateral
frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear
diffusely, followed by symmetric vertex waves.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving.  HR
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Beta diffuse
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake and drowsy.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information.  Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such
as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not
rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
