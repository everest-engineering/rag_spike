CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 62-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease, onset of epilepsy in 2012. Family reports that she has prolonged postictal impairment after seizures and has been not seizure-free with phenytoin.  For seizures, thus far this year, perhaps 6 with prolonged postictal state.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenytoin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was quite drowsy.  This was a technically extremely challenging EEG with a great deal of muscle artifact while the patient was awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal, quite disorganized.  When the patient is awake, there is generous theta.  There is an asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity noted on the right compared to the left.  Rhythmic frontally predominant delta activity was identified.  Stimulation of the patient at some points produces an alerting response with an alpha, theta frequency pattern and on other occasions, produces FIRDA.  The frontally predominant activity is sharply contoured.  There are some irregular sharply contoured discharges in the right hemisphere including F4 with variability in terms of the overall field and at times they are more isoelectric at Fv, F4 and other times a little bit more at F4, Fp2.  The sharp waves are not prominent and are obscured within the other frontally predominant higher amplitude activity.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Technically challenging bedside EEG, but markedly abnormal due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Frontal irregular rhythmic delta activity.
Frontally predominant delta with a likely right frontal sharp wave complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  Similar features were noted with previous studies.  Ongoing vigilance for this postictal patient who is still quite drowsy is suggested.
