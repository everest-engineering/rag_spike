LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 73-year-old man who presents with new onset of loss of consciousness on 12/27/2012 that lasted less than 15 seconds with return to baseline.  Prior to the event the patient felt a warm sensation rising to his head.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During very brief arousal there is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no clear anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background during very brief arousal consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta activity mixed with under-riding faster frequencies.  There is excess beta seen diffusely.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Mild diffuse slowing.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
Primarily asleep study
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal minimally awake, mostly asleep, 22-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, however, it could also represent excessively drowsy patient.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
