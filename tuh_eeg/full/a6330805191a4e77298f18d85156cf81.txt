CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old male with recurrent vertigo and fatigue.
MEDICATIONS: Os-Cal, Nexium, Lexapro, Albuterol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with 9.5 Hz 40 mcv posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized
by slow rolling eye movements. Vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles are observed
in stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation is performed after the patient has been asleep.
There is a driving response observed, though the patient is drifting in an out of sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a scant amount of background slowing.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this EEG. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important
consideration, a repeat study capturing one of his spells is advised.
