History:	83 YR OLD FEMALE PRESENTS WITH H/O  ONSET OF LEFT SIDED WEAKNESS
AND SLURRED SPEECH/RT MCA STROKE. PMHX SIG FOR ICH IN LT FRONTAL
LOBE. NOTED WITH LT ARM SHAKING THIS AM EEG TO R/O SZ.
Medications:	LOVENOX, METOPROLOL, LABETALOL, ASPIRIN, TYLENOL
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake
Description:
A posterior dominant rhythm at best reached 6Hz  Background activity was characterized by diffuse
low voltage delta and theta activity with absence of the expected anterior to posterior gradient of
frequencies.  No normal sleep architecture was present.
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral anterior temporal regions.  No
epileptiform discharges are present.  No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  There was no reactivity to auditory,
tactile, or painful stimuli.  Hr is 90 and irregular with frequent PVCs
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, anterior
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous diffuse
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of  intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral anterior temporal
regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.
In addition there is  diffuse background slowing and absent alpha rhythm.  These findings are
etiologically nonspecific indicators of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
