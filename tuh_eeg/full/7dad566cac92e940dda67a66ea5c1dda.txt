History: 70 year old man
Medications: 70 year old man with a history of CVA who presented with altered mental status.
No AEDs listed in the chart.
Sedation:
EEG Typo: Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique: international 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy

Description:
The waking background is well-organized, with a 25-40uV, 8Hz symmetric alpha rhythm which attenuates on eye opening. There is 6-7Hz diffuse theta activity noted during wakefulness. Symmetric beta activity Is present, maximal over bilateral frontal  regions. During drowsiness. the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.

Occasional polymorphic delta activity is present in the frontotemporal region during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness. No epileptiform discharges are present. No clinical or electrographic seizures were present.

Hyperventilation was not performed. Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional abnormalities. HR Is 55-80 bpm.

Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic
Focal slowing, polymorphic

This is an ABNORMAL EEG because of 1) diffuse background slowing and slow posterior dominant rhythm. These findings are etiologically non specific indicators of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction. 2) occasional local slowing in the left frontotemporal region. This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
