AGE: 55 y.o.
SEX: male
DATE OF STUDY: 09/22/2015 RECORDING ENVIRONMENT: ICU
EEG TYPE: 20-40 min, coma study EEG #: 15-1390
HISTORY:
55 y.o. male with a history of DM 2 who presented to ER with chest pain, then became unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS: propofol, lorazepam, bicarbonate
SEDATION: propofol (stopped prior to study), lorazepam TECHNIQUE:
A 21 channel electroencephalogram	(EEG) was recorded using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes and utilized a NicOne system. This study was at times technically limited by low amplitude muscle artifact in all leads. It included a single channel of EKG.
EEG BACKGROUND:
The background is continuous, symmetric, poorly organized and consists of delta with admixed alpha and theta frequencies.
During stimulation the background demonstrates reactivity, with disorganized alpha, theta, and beta activity.
There is moderate generalized slowing. No focal slowing is present.
EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:
No epileptiform activity is present.
OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM):
None
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Noxious stimulation is performed as described under "background "
Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic Stimulation: Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.
EVENTS:
There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.
HEART RATE:
A heart rate of 90 bpm, at times irregular and with wide-complex beats, is captured on a single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:
This is an abnormal, somewhat technically-limited routine EEG due to:
Moderate generalized slowing and suboptimal organization
Heart rate abnormalities noted on a single EKG strip, as above
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
These findings indicate the presence of moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction , which may at least in part be associated with medication effect. Irregular heart rate with wide-complex beats
is noted on a single EKG strip.
