REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old male with a history of seizures for a month.  Last one 1 week ago consisting of generalized tonic/clonic shaking with tongue biting.  Sometimes he has blinking tremors and staring.  Also has hypertension and reflux.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Restoril, and Zantac.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakeful state and sleep.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation.  It did reveal some normal discharges which will be described next.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate:  54.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Burst of generalized spike and wave at 3.5 to 4 Hz were seen frequently throughout the recording.  These bursts were anterior predominant and symmetric and lasting a maximum of 2 seconds.  There appeared to be no clinical changes during these episodes that the technician could note.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized spike and wave.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
