History:	48 year old woman with history of childhood epilepsy presenting with change in
mental status.
Medications:	Topamax, Xanax and others
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 8-8.5 Hz theta activity.
AP gradient is poor.  Diffuse excess polymorphic theta and delta activity is present.  Frequent brief
(2-5 second) bursts of 100-200uV, 2-4Hz rhythmic bifrontal slow waves occur throughout the
recording, increasing in frequency during drowsiness.  During brief drowsiness, the background is
characterized by increase in diffuse polymorphic theta and delta activity.
Subtle paucity of faster frequencies is noted over the right temporal region.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with variable cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce additional
abnormalities.  HR was 60.
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
No electrographic seizures
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, right temporal, subtle
FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity), intermittent
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 25-minute EEG due to mild diffuse slowing and
subtle intermittent right temporal focal slowing. Diffuse slowing is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  Intermittent focal slowing is indicative of focal
cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  FIRDA
could be seen in encephalopathy, bilateral deep white matter lesions and increased ICP.
