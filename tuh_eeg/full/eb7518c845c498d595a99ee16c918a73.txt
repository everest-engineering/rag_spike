CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed male with a previous brain tumor resection, now occasional left-sided trembling and right-sided skull defect.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Underlying this, there is some focal delta in the right centrotemporal and posterior temporal regions.  A prominent breach rhythm is noted and maneuvers which accentuate faster frequency activity clearly accentuate the breach.  Hyperventilation seems to also accentuate the focal slowing.  There was some photic driving. Features of sleep include increase in beta.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal delta in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports an underlying structural phenomenon in the right hemisphere which is subcortical.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If
the facial trembling is thought to be a seizure, a more prolonged study or an outpatient study is suggested to more fully evaluate this entity.
