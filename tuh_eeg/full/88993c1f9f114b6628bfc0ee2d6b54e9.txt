History:	93 YR OLD FEMALE WITH EPISODES OF  TREMULOUSNESS AND
UNRESPONSIVENESS. ALSO EPISODES OF RECURRENT WORD FINDING
DIFFICULTY.
Medications:	ZOCOR, SIMVASTATIN, NIFEDIPINE, LOSARTAN
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes, awake,
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.7Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central theta activity, frontal
beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and becomes
intermittent. Occasional shifting slowing is seen  During stage 2 sleep, the record slows further to
moderate voltage 2-4Hz activity, and symmetric sleep spindles and K complexes appear.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was not performed.
Summary of Findings:
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL EEG, awake, drowsy, and asleep.
