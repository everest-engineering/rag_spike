CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old right handed female with the sudden onset of confusion starting July 6, 2012.  The patient remembers having breakfast and then she does not remember any events after that.  She has been confused since then.  Past medical history, fibromyalgia and asthma.
MEDICATIONS:  Clarinex, Nasonex, Pulmicort, Proventil, Nexium, Famotidine, Nadolol, Restasis, Topamax, Fiorinal, Relefin, Lidoderm Patch, Singulair
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Alpha is reactive with eye closure.  Abundant frontal central beta is noted in relaxed, wakefulness, and early drowsiness.  Sleep spindles and POSTS are noted in stage II sleep. For a predominant part of the EEG she remains drowsy.  Photic stimulation causes driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG, but she is drowsy for the major part of the EEG which could indicate sleep deprivation or medication use.  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
