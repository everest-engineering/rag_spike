History:	64 year old woman with a history of left sided meningioma (status post gamma knife
in 8/2014), now presents with headaches and left sided eye and facial twitching.
Medications:	ELAVIL, PERCOCET, NORVASC, FLEXERIL, NEURONTIN,
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes, awake, drowsy,
hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Fast alpha variant is captured.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  During brief drowsiness, the alpha rhythm
attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
Intermittent left anterior temporal polymorphic theta activity is captured.  No epileptiform
discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with fair cooperation, and produces no effect.
Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, left temporal, anterior
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and briefly drowsy 27-minute EEG due to mild intermittent focal
slowing in the left anterior temporal region.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction,
which is etiologically non-specific, but possibly structural in origin.  No epileptiform discharges are
present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep
recording may provide additional information.
