REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old female with a history of strokes, depression, hypertension, asthma and reflux as well as recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Abilify, baby aspirin, citalopram, clonazepam, diltiazem, folic acid, Plavix, Proventil, Singulair.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3, at the same time also intermittently at F8/T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral independent  anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of bilateral independent anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were captured.
