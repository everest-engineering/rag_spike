CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old woman with end-stage liver disease and cirrhosis,
awaiting liver transplant; evaluate for poor mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Albumin, Pantoprazole, Rifaximin, Insulin, Ancef, Haldol,
Cefepime, Mycamine, Daptomycin, Norepinephrine, Bumetanide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly slow and
includes a mixture of rhythmic theta, shifting arrhythmic delta activity, and occasional
triphasic waves. There is some sharply contoured or triangular shaped waves noted in
the right posterior temporal or occipital region. Periodic complexes are variable in the
record and may be prominent or subtle. Occasional bursts of FIRDA are observed.
Stimulation of the patient produces a vigorous rhythmic theta and some alpha frequency
activity.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:

1. Rhythmic background slowing.
2. Triphasic waves.
3. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.


CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is wonderful reactivity to tactile stimuli with

improvement of the background. This EEG is most supportive of a metabolic encephalopathy.
