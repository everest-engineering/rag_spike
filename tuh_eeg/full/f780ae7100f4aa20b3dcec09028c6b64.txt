No current facility-administered medications for this visit.

SEDATION: TECHNIQUE:

A 21 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using the International 10-20 system with Tl/T2 electrodes was performed utilized a NicOne system. This was a technically satisfactory record and included a single channel of EKG and photic stimulation .



EEG BACKGROUND:

The waking background is symmetric, reactive, and consists of a mixture of alpha and a moderate amount of bifrontal beta activity, organized in a normal anterior-to-posterior gradient. Wakefulness is characterized by a symmetric and reactive 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), which attenuates symmetrically with eye opening.



During drowsiness, slow rolling eye movements, attenuation and fragmentation of the posterior dominant rhythm, and diffuse background slowing are seen.



There are normal sleep transients, with synchronous and symmetric vertex waves, sleep spindles and K-complexes present during Stage II sleep. Slow wave sleep is not captured.

No generalized slowing is present.	No focal slowing is present. EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY:

No epileptiform activity is present.



OTHER PAROXYSMAL ACTIVITY (NON-EPILEPTIFORM) :

None



ACTIVATION PROCEDURES :



Hyperventilation: was deferred, due to pulmonary issues Photic Stimulation: elicits minimal driving

EVENTS:

There are no clinical or electrographic events captured during this study.



HEART RATE:

An irregular	heart rate of 96 bpm is captured on a single EKG lead.



IMPRESSION:



This is a normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.	There are no clinical or electrographic events reported or detected.



CLINICAL CORRELATION:

This is the second normal awake-and-asleep routine EEG.

A normal routine EEG does not support or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy.
