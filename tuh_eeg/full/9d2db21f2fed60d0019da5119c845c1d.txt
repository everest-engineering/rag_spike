CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed woman, with history of neurologic disease, including complex migraine, possible seizures, possible posterior stroke or syncopal event.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient has a great deal of muscle artifact on this bedside EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  There appears to be scant theta, but there is also a great deal of muscle artifact.
HR:    84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG includes no sleep, no hyperventilation, and no photic stimulation.  If a complete assessment for epilepsy is needed, a follow up study in the laboratory is suggested.
