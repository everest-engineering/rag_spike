History:	47 year old man who experienced an acute change in mental status several days
ago with associated right arm shaking.
Medications:	No sedation/ Seizure meds
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9-10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Slow alpha variant is present.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz
activity is present, maximal over bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-7Hz
activity is present throughout the recording and increases during drowsiness.  During brief
drowsiness, the alpha rhythm attenuates, and 5-7Hz slow waves appear diffusely.
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
No epileptiform discharges
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, mild
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG due to mild diffuse slowing. This finding is
indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.  No epileptiform
discharges are present, but stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with
sleep recording may provide additional information.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a
routine EEG does not rule out a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
