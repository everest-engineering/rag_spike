OPENED HIS EYES THIS AM NEVER LOOKED AT NURSE JUST STARING.
PMHX 2 STROKES 3 YRS AGO, HBP,COPD
Medications:	HEPARIN, ATROVENT
Sedation:	None
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, drowsy
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 9.5Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  As drowsiness progresses, symmetric vertex waves appear.
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity is present in the left midtemporal region during wakefulness,
increasing during drowsiness.  Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the right mid to
posterior temporal regions during wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  HR is 78 and irregular.
Summary of Findings:
Focal slowing, rhythmic, intermittent, mild, left temporal, mid
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, mild, right temporal, mid-posterior temporal
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the left
midtemporal and right mid-posterior temporal regions.  This finding is indicative of focal cerebral
dysfunction, which is etiologically non-specific.  No epileptiform discharges are present, but stage 2
sleep was not recorded.  No clinical or electrographic seizures are present.
