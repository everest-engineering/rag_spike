History:	26 year old who had a recent episode concerning for a seizure.
Medications:	Gabapentin
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes, awake, hyperventilation, photic
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10.5-11Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present.  Patient remains awake throughout
No focal slowing is present.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is performed for 240 seconds with good cooperation, and produces mild diffuse
symmetric background slowing and bursts of generalized delta activity.  Stepped photic stimulation
from 1-21 flashes per second (fps) induces symmetric photic driving at multiple flash rates.  A single
EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
Summary of Findings:
No stage 2 sleep
Beta, excessive
No epileptiform discharges
Interpretation:
This is a NORMAL 22-minute awake only EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were present, but stage
2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinically indicated, repeat EEG with sleep recording may provide
additional information. Excessive beta activity could be secondary to the medication effect, such as
benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate of ~ 60 bpm.
