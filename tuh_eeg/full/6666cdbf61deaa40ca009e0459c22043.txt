CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 41-year-old woman with new-onset spells with nocturnal tongue biting, nocturnal incontinence, and daytime staring spells.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Routine, 20-minute digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was a technically satisfactory EEG capturing wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited symmetric, bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
