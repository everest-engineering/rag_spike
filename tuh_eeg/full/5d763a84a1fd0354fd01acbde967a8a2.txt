CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old woman with a one to 10 year history of seizures which are typically associated with problems with her dialysis, sepsis or other medical problems. Last seizure 2 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Procardia, Insulin, Lisinopril, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm but also some 6 Hz activity. There are bursts of rhythmic theta identified from either hemisphere, some of which is sharply contoured particularly at T3/T5 and then again in the right mid temporal region. Prominent shifting asymmetries are noted. Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase In background stowing.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Prominent shifting slowing.
3. Excess theta.
4. Some bursts of sharply contoured slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are nonspecific. There are no definitive epileptiform features. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study may be of value.
