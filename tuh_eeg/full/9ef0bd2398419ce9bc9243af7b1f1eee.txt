History:	71 YR FEMALE WITH CC OF CVA AND VASOGENIC EDEMA 2/15  WITH
SUBSEQUENT SZS.
Medications:
Sedation:
EEG Type:	Routine, awake & drowsy
Technique:	International 10-20 System; standard 21 electrodes with T1/T2 electrodes and EKG
electrodes
Description:
Waking background is characterized by a 25-40uV, 10Hz alpha rhythm, which attenuates
symmetrically with eye opening.  Symmetric 5-15uV, 18-25Hz activity is present, maximal over
bilateral frontal regions.  Excess diffuse admixed 50-75 uV, 5-9Hz activity is present throughout the
recording and increases during drowsiness.  During drowsiness, the background slows to central
theta activity, frontal beta activity becomes more prominent, and the alpha rhythm attenuates and
Intermittent polymorphic delta activity is present in the bilateral midtemporal regions during
wakefulness, increasing during drowsiness.  No epileptiform discharges are present.
Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation from 1-21 flashes per second (fps)
does not produce any effect.  Hr was 72
Summary of Findings:
Diffuse slowing, polymorphic, continuous, mild diffuse
Focal slowing, polymorphic, intermittent, bilateral temporal, mid
Interpretation:
This is an ABNORMAL awake and drowsy EEG because of intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral
midtemporal regions.  This finding are indicative of independent focal cerebral dysfunction in both
regions and it is etiologically non-specific.In addition there is mild  diffuse background slowing.
This finding is indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
