REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 86-year-old woman presents with a history of confusion, staring spells with incontinence, found on the floor.  Past medical history of bilateral strokes in 2004 and diabetes.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, insulin, Plavix, Protonix, and aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz that is best seen over the right hemisphere.  Over the left hemisphere there is a slight decrease in normal faster frequencies and hemispheric slowing which I will discuss in the abnormal discharges.  The photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen rarely at F74/T3 in wakefulness.
Focal slow waves seen continuously at F74/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  90.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal sharp waves and focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left anterior temporal region.  There is evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximal at the left anterior temporal region, which may be consistent with the known recent stroke.  No seizures were seen.
