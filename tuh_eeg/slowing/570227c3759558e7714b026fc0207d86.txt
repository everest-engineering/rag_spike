CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old right handed female, with family history of seizures who presents with 7 witnessed episodes of seizure described by family as movements of all 4 extremities.  She also has a history of developmental delay since age 8.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote, Klonopin.
REASON FOR EEG:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Sleep, stage I, was recorded, as well as wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a posterior dominant rhythm, best about 9 Hz frequency and 22-60 mV amplitude.  There is normal frontal central beta seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation did not reveal any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Sharp waves and spikes are seen at P3, in short runs at times, lasting up to 3 seconds.  Some intermittent focal delta is also seen in that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent left parietal sharp waves.
Focal slowing, left parietal
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left parietal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left parietal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
