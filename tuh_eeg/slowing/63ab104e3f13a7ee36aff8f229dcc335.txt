CLINICAL HISTORY: 72-year-old male status post saphenous vein graft with "top of the
basilar" syndrome and bilabial occipital shakes with episodes of seizures on 2/7 to 2/8/2008.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, Lopressor, Famotidine, Dilantin, Ativan, Hydralazine, Heparin,
Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Background EEG demonstrates a relatively continuous
pattern with intermittent attenuation. There is a mixed frequency pattern of theta and
intermittent attenuation at the faster frequent activity and much slower delta, some of which is
0.3/sec. Intermittently in this record, there is some very subtle, low voltage fast activity and
which is not quite beta but is 11-13 Hz for frequency activity discernible in the occipital region,
left greater than right. This is reviewed using a sensitivity of 3. This does not evolve.
Spontaneous arousals are observed and eye opening as well as an increase in theta is
observed with tactile stimulation. The data was re-reviewed with an occipital montage to be
certain that there are no subtle epileptiform complexes in that area. None are observed.
HR: 74 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing with some intermittently discontinuous pattern.
2. Question very subtle faster frequency activity seen on the mid-occipital regions with
specific montages.
CLINICAL This EEG is compatible with a pharmacologic pattern at this point.
No epileptiform features were seen and there were no seizures observed today.
