CLINICAL HISTORY:   72-year-old gentleman with "top of the basilar syndrome," bilateral cortical strokes on Thursday February 7 and subsequent  multiple seizures on the afternoon and evening of February 8, intubated and transferred to the ICU.
MEDICATIONS:   Vancomycin, Lopressor, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement  with 1 channel of EKG. Patient intubated, restless, but arousable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Background EEG demonstrates  initially a pattern of somnolence with low voltage pattern. With stimulation, there is appearance of an 11 hertz, bilateral posterior dominant rhythm. As the sustained waking record continues, there is some occipitally predominant  theta observed bilaterally. This activity can be reformatted  into a circle montage. The theta activity which arises out of the alpha seems to have a phase reversal at F1 until a beta frequency evolution. Total duration for this event is 31 seconds. No definitive clinical features are associated with this. After this, the patient drops into a pattern with slow-rolling eye movements and then there is intermittent occipitally predominant  theta frequency activity with some very subtle frequency evolution. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal response, but in the initial portion of the record, stimulation of the patient also seemed to produce a seizure. Toward the close of the record, there is a second discharge, compatible  with a seizure. Again this begins with approximately 13 hertz activity demonstrating gradual frequency evolution. Unlike the first event, this one does have the same sharp waves in the occipital regions, left greater than right.
HR: 	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Two occipital seizures each 30-40 seconds in duration.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:	This EEG supports a subclinical format of recurrent repetitive seizures and additional recording is appropriate.
