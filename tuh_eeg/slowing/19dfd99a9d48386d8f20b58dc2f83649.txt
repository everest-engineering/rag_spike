REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 43-year-old man with refractory localization related epilepsy and a history of febrile seizures who presents for seizure classification and localization.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Vimpat, and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and patient's notes, alarms, and nurses' notes were all used to review the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  There are no activating procedures produced.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I, stage II, and deeper stages of sleep.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T3 occasionally in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 at times rhythmically during wakefulness and sleep at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
Episodes:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal sharp waves and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  I will dictate this at the end of the full report.  This is day #1 of recording.
