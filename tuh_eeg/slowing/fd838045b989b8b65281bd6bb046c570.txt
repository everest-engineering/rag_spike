CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman with recurrent complex partial status.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Darvocet, Thyroid, and Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The data is reviewed in the
conventional manner as well as with an average reference.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a pattern of repetitive
seizures. The seizures have a broad field of spread but are maximal in the temporal
regions. They typically begin with electropositivity at 01, negative in the anterior
temporal region, and then progress to an anterior temporal focus but with some bilateral
occipital representation. The seizures wax and wane and have a clear evolution. The
patient is stimulated during the EEG. It is difficult to determine if she has
responsiveness during the seizures. At the end of the EEG recording, the patient is
continuing to have seizures but they seem to be much more prominent in the left
occipital region with a positivity. Seizures wax and wane. The patient is intubated.
HR: 80bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. status epilepticus pattern, now maximum on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a prominent epileptiform focus which
differs substantially from the process noted in the previous sections of the EEG
recording reported last week.
