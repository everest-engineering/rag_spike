REASON FOR STUDY:  Follow-up EEG for seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a left occipital metastasis from small lung cell cancer here with recurrent seizures, now having hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Keppra, Celexa, vancomycin, insulin, famotidine, rosuvastatin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
CLINICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Frequent focal sharp waves seen at T5 and O1 while awake.  At times, these sharp waves appear to be rhythmic and occur in bursts that last for 5-6 seconds.
Focal slow waves at T5, O1 seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  91.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent left posterior temporal and occipital sharp waves, at times with rhythmic bursts, as well as focal slowing in the same region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy arising from the left posterior temporal and occipital region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability in that region.  Please note that even though at times these bursts appear to be rhythmic, they do not clearly evolve.  During the recording, at one point the patient did complain of one of the hallucinations and there appeared to be some focal slowing and rhythmic sharp waves occurring at the time but no clear evolution or consistent correlate to that behavior.  These findings were discussed with the team as the EEG was completed.
