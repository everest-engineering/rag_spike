CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 54-year-old male with status epilepticus, status-post closed head injury.  CAT scan on July 18 showed left frontal hematoma, anterior right temporal, and posterior corpus callosum.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Depakote, Dilantin, and Propofol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The patient was intubated and unresponsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrated low voltage and diffuse slowing.  It is poorly organized, intermixed with frequent spike and slow waves. Frequently, bursts of spike and slow waves lasted for 30 to 90 seconds without change in the background.  This electrical epileptiform discharge activity was correlated with the physical epilepsy activity on video.  As the recording continues in the situation of no information about a Propofol drip, it is not easy to identify the physical seizures when we subsequently frequently identify the signal spike and slow wave bursts.  Within the 24-hour time frame, from 12:00 noon to 12:00 midnight, more than 50 spells of the bursts of spike and slow wave activity lasting 30 to 90 seconds were identified.  More frequently, poly spike activity bursts of about 3 seconds were seen without clinical seizure correlation on video.

HR:  114 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal Video EEG due to:
1. Frequent bursts of spike and slow waves lasting from 30 to 90 seconds.
2. Bursts of poly spikes lasting about 3 seconds.
3. Low voltage and diffusely slow background with theta activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This abnormal EEG demonstrated that this patient is in status epilepticus.  The bursts of spike and slow waves as well as poly spikes suggests a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
