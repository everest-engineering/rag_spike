CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old woman with refractory status epilepticus.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Keppra, Phenobarbital, ASA, Metoprolol, HCTZ, Diovan, Plavix, Ativan, Imdur

INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This follows routine EEG 10-596 for continuous left temporal seizures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins in the late afternoon of the 17th, frequent repetitive sharp waves and seizures are noted. These seizures start to decline by 18:00 hours and by 22:00 hours the seizures seem to have stopped. Sharp waves are noted In the background, but on the recording on the 18th, relatively infrequent left temporal sharp waves or left central sharp waves are seen. The overall background Is more of a theta frequency pattern. When the patient is not experiencing seizures, she is quite active. Little sleep is noted on the 18th.

IMPRESSION: CLINICAL CORRELATION: This long-term monitoring session is remarkable for resolution of complex partial status epilepticus.
