REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old man with Lennox-Gastaut and daily seizures, and VNS placed 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Klonopin, Topamax, Trileptal, Dilantin, Keppra, and VNS.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at most reaches 6 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening in addition to normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate:  78.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Bursts of generalized slow spike and waves with frontal predominance and at times an asymmetric left predominant onset at a frequency of 2-2.5 Hz lasting up to 11 seconds that occurred multiple times during the recording.  At times the tech would try to verbally or physically touch the patient, and it was not clear if he would respond.
Focal sharp waves seen independently at F7/T3 in sleep. Some seen at F8/T4.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording even in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to slow generalized spike and waves as well as bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves and focal slowing, in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATIONS:   This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic generalized epilepsy seen in syndromes such as Lennox-Gastaut.  No clear seizures were identified during this recording.
