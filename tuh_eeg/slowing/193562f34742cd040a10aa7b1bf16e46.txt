CLINICAL HISTORY: 72-year-old male with recent bilateral occipital stroke and cortical
blindness. The patient had 2 prior EEGs during hospitalization and new seizures during
hospitalization.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Insulin, Lopressor, Famotidine, Dilantin, Hydralazine, Heparin,
Lorazepam Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Since his last EEG, the patient has been intubated,
sedated and paralyzed. This EEG is markedly suppressed. It begin with episodes of burst
suppression. However, during the record, some background theta can be appreciated with
stimulation. It is intermittently discontinuous. There are episode when the patient is biting down
on his ET tube, however, this does not elicit any change in the EEG record. Tactile stimulation of
the patient shows no change in the EEG as well. Toward the end of the record, there is one
period where he briefly chews. This seems to produce a very mild arousal characterized by
increased theta. He does appear to be bucking the vent at times without any change in the
EKG.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Burst suppression with occasional background theta and intermittent discontinuity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION.: This EEG supports severe disturbance in brain nonfunctioning.
Exposure to sedatives and anti-anxiolytics (Ativan and Fentanyl) for example could support this
very slow pattern. No epileptiform activity was identified during the EEG.
