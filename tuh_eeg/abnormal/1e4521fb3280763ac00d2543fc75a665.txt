CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed woman with transient left-sided weakness with lip smacking.  The patient reports ongoing unsteadiness and lip smacking since November 11, 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was experiencing involuntary mouth movements during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm at 70 microvolts which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The patient is asked to count backward from 11.  The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern.  It is difficult to see if the involuntary oral movements responded to the maneuvers.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient's involuntary movements were not associated with an EEG signature.  Additional neurodiagnostic assessment may be appropriate.
