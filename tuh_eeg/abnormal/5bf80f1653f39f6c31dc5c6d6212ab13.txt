CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, seizures, schizophrenia, and CAD, presents with altered mental status, had acute change in mental status and was minimally responsive.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam, Protonix, Lisinopril, Percocet, Plavix, Lovenox
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake.  No activating procedures were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly slow background at 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness at 5 to 7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
