CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed male with change in mental status, new onset right-sided weakness; evaluate for seizure or stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and
disorganized and the patient is quite drowsy throughout the record. There are shifting asymmetries. There are sections of the record where there is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm identified on the right with bursts of more rhythmic frontal slowing on the left, but there are shifting asymmetries noted in the record. Features of drowsiness include an
increase in bilateral slowing and the asymmetry is less prominent at that time. The disruption of faster frequency activity on the left is compatible with the cortical process, but there were no epileptiform features noted today. Photic stimulation elicits no
significant driving.
HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Intermittent focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, there are no sharp waves identified today.
