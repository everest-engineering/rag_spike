CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old with a fall, concussion, and confusional episode, possible seizure a month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, albuterol.,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm.
Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicits a generous driving response.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in the EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
