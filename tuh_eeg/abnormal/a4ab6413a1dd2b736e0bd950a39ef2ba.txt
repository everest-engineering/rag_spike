CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old woman with a seizure in October, previously seizure free for many years.
MEDICATIONS: Dyazide, Clonidine, Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION; Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is almost an exclusive sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Most of the record includes stage II sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles and POSTS. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage II sleep. Hyperventilation is also performed while the patient is relatively drowsy with a beta frequency pattern and scant 10 hertz alpha. There are some minor electrode artifacts noted in the background.
HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to a previous study which identifies slightly asymmetric POSTS, this study is symmetric although there is some electrode artifacts. There were no epileptiform features. In addition, there were no normal variants which resemble epileptiform features although there was scant amount of artifact and 1 or 2 rare bursts of shifting symmetry irrespective of the artifacts. There are no epileptiform features.
