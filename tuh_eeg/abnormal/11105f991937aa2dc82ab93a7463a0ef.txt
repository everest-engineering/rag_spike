CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old woman with chronic static encephalopathy.  Epilepsy as an infant, followed by a closed head injury at age 5 with a development of refractory epilepsy, now seizure free for many years.
MEDICATIONS:  Diamox, primidone, calcium, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness background, the EEG includes a diffusely slow pattern with a 7.5 Hz alpha and a background rich in rhythmic theta.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicits driving at faster flash frequencies.  Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is similar to an EEG in 2009.  No epileptiform features were identified in today's EEG.  There is a very small amount of shifting slowing.  This may be an age-related finding.  No epileptiform features were noted in the last 2 EEGs.  In 1990â€™s, when the patient was having frequent seizures, electrographic seizures were identified from the left temporal region with interictal right temporal sharp waves.
