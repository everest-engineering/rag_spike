CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed woman with bipolar disease and a history of head trauma.  Now she has episodic stuttering of speech, confusional episodes, and memory deficits.
MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, Ativan, Percocet, Neurontin, Wellbutrin, Lithium, Soma.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.
Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces rhythmic background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, an
ambulatory EEG monitoring session may be helpful to capture one of the patient's events.
