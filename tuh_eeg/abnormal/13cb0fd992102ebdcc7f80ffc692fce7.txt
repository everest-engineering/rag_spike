CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, increasingly refractory
after this past year; last seizure 1 week ago.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, Metoprolol, Keppra, Glipizide, Risperdal, Trazodone,
ASA, Levetiracetam, Pantoprazole, Polyethylene, Simvastatin, Hyoscyamine, Oxycodone,
Bisacodyl
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a marked asymmetry
between the 2 hemispheres. The right hemisphere demonstrates disruption of the alpha rhythm
with arrhythmic delta activity and high-amplitude right posterior temporal spikes and sharp
waves. Not all the sharp waves in the right hemisphere are identical. On some occasions,
there seems to be a positivity at C4 with a T6 phase reversal. The field is spread and overall
amplitude is somewhat variable. In addition, the amount of arrhythmic delta activity in the right
hemisphere is also variable. This high-amplitude spike demonstrates significant spread in a
referential montage and actually has picked up T6, 02, T 4, and even L1. On occasion, again
there is a positivity, either T4 or C4, depending on the montage employed and the delta is
throughout the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere is relatively well organized with a 9 Hz
posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the epileptiform
activity and arrhythmic delta. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
2. High amplitude right occipital and posterior temporal spiking.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The prominent epileptiform activity as well as the focal slowing
has been seen in previous studies for this individual. This EEG demonstrates significant
epileptogenicity, even when she is well.
