MEDICINES: Dilantin, Norvasc, Coreg, and others.
HISTORY: A 57 -year-old, right-handed woman with seizures, seizure-free for an extended period of time, but with recurrent seizures this year in February. She does well with very low doses of Phenytoin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, fronto-central beta. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta. Deeper stages of sleep are nonsustained.
Hyperventilation produces some slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. As the patient drifts off to sleep at the very end of the record, there is a bit more theta on the left than the right.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG nor prior EEG in 2007. Careful review of the database is important to determine if there are other EEGs in the interim.
