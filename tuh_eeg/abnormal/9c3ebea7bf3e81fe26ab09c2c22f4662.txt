CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old woman with epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizures with post ictal confusion, last seizures 2 months ago with shaking, eye rolling and tongue biting.  Previous seizures in pregnancy 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Seroquel, Vistaril.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and an asleep record.
TECHNICAL:  Impedances were a little higher at T1, T2 and C3.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low amplitude but there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm and generous, low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  The patient seems to be quite drowsy, drifting in and out of a drowsy state with slow moving eye movements and an increase in beta followed by rhythmic central theta.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation was performed for this drowsy adult and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient had a previous normal EEG 06/10/2010 with a question of temporal rhythmic in a temporal state of drowsiness.  This is a normal EEG today and no normal variants were identified.  In this individual with incomplete control of her seizures, additional EEG recording may be helpful to characterize her underlying epilepsy.
