CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old woman with renal failure, two tonic-clonic seizures followed
by intubation, now complaining of total body pain and lower extremity swelling and erythema.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake but uncomfortable. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with a rhythmic theta  frequency pattern. There are bursts of bilateral, frontally predominant rhythmic delta. In addition, there are bursts of high amplitude delta activity in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread. Some of these are associated with sharp waves in the right hemisphere including right central and parietal regions. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity. As the recording continues sharp waves are noted with different localizations including FP2, F8 and T4. The transition to stage II sleep Is associated with vertex waves and spindles followed by arousal.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Prominent epileptiform activity in the right hemisphere with a generous field of spread.
3. FIRDA
4. High amplitude delta in the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are to the previous EEGs performed in July 2009. No seizures were recorded. The studies a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
