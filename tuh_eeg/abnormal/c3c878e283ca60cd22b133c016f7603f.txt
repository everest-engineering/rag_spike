CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with history of seizures since 2009, last
tonic-clonic seizure was 09/ 1/2011 with postictal confusion, 6 seizures since onset.
MEDICATIONS: None
FOR Seizures.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode
placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes. The recording was
performed during wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures with hyperventilation and
photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG opens up to a well-defined posterior dominant
rhythm of 9 Hz with a 20-60 microvolt amplitude. There was normal frontocentral beta seen.
Sleep is characterized by stage I. Activating procedures including photic stimulation and
hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: During the recording, there are multiple bursts of prominent
frontal sharply contoured theta that appears to be maximal at the frontal polar electrodes. It
does not appear to clearly evolve and it only occurs interburst with no clinical correlate seen on
video. The significance of these discharges is unclear.
TECHNICAL None.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Normal awake and asleep EEG
This is a normal EEG, awake and asleep. The bursts of frontal
predominant theta may be related to state change, however, the sharp contours raise the
suspicion for a possible generalized abnormality. Further recording with deeper stages of sleep
may Â· identifying the etiology of this discharge.
