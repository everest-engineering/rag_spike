CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right handed male with alcohol intoxication, abnormal eye deviation, and abnormal abdominal movements, possible either seizure, hemorrhage, or calcification in the brain.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Dilantin, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern rich in beta frequency activity, but there is also some alpha and theta frequency activity. The patient appear.. to be drowsy with slow rolling eye movements and some slow rolling head movements. As the recording continues, additional sweat artifact is observed. Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an arousal with an increase in alpha and beta frequency activity, and even a glimpse of an alpha rhythm of 9.7 Hz.

HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most compatible with a sedated state. No epileptiform features were seen and there were no focal features. Additional EEG recording may be considered to more completely evaluate the activity.
