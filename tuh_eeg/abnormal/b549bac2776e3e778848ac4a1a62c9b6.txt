CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with a feeling of disequilibrium
and presyncope, admitted in July 2009.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10
Hz, 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an
increase in background slowing. Stage II sleep includes vertex waves, K complexes,
spindles and POSTS. The patient is quite sleepy and transitions in and out of stage II
sleep. The POSTS are of slightly higher amplitude on the left. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in amplitude. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. The
amplitude asymmetry of the POSTS is a normal finding.
