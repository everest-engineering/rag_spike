CLINICAL HISTORY: A 48-year-old woman with epilepsy, metastatic cancer, cord
compression. Last seizure was 2 months ago. Past history of throat cancer,
chemotherapy, bipolar disease, asthma.

MEDICATIONS:

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm
which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Asymmetric muscle artifact is noted.
Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm as well as an
increase in beta. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response as well as accentuation with a breach rhythm. Heart rate is 72 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if further information is needed to
characterize this patient's epilepsy, a follow up study is suggested .
