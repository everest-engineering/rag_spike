CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old male with a history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with slowing of the
background. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation
elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
