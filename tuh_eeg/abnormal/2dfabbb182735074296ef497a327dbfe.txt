CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old left handed woman with refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very confused and restless. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is diffusely slow with rhythmic theta disrupted by rhythmic frontal delta. Overall, this is a relatively symmetric record although there are shifting asymmetries and a suggestion of some poorly formed sharp waves in the right temporal region. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal with dysarthria and an increase in theta.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Prominent FIRDA.
3. Occasional shifting slowing.
4. Some sharply contoured slowing from the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most supportive of a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. Although these findings can be seen as part of a postictal state, a followup study may be helpful to assess response to treatment.
