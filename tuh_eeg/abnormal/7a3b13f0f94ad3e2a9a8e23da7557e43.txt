CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old male with previous right MCA and left PCA infarction, as well as CAD and CHF, now with change in mental status and agitation.

MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Diazepam, Lamictal, Heparin, Aspirin

REASON FOR STUDY: Confusion.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The-patient was awake during the study, but restless, lethargic, and non? co	No activating procedures were performed.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: Continuous movement during the recording.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely slow-background with no posterior dominant rhythm and normal frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.

ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
1. Focal slow waves seen at the left hemisphere maximal in the F7/T1, at 2-4 Hz:
seen continuously.  In this hemisphere, however, there is a mixture of faster frequencies during the record
2. Low amplitude and lack of faster frequencies over the right hemisphere.
3. Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz: with intermittent FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activities).

SEIZURES:  None.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slow waves.
2. Left hemispheric focal structural dysfunction.
3. possible right hemispheric focal cortical dysfunction.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals evidence of left hemispheric structural dysfunction maximal in the anterior temporal region with additional possible cortical dysfunction of the right hemisphere. There is also evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
