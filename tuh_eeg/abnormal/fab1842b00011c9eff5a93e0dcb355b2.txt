REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old woman with history of cavernous meningioma and subsequent seizure, last seizure 1 month ago, woke up with a bitten tongue, about one seizure per year.  The patient also complains of being dizzy, fainting, and migraines almost every day, and anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Sensamide, Klonopin, and Ventolin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that is still difficult to see due to the excessive beta, but appears to be 10 Hz and reactive to eye opening.  There is an excessive diffuse amount of beta throughout the recording.  The patient has no abnormal discharges noted during hyperventilation and photic stimulation reveals a nice drive response.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Note:  The excessive beta may sometimes be seen with the use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
