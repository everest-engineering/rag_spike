REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 50-year-old woman with cerebral palsy and mental retardation who presents with episodes of staring, here for evaluation of possible seizures.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient had an increased amount of movement artifact and the impedances were not appropriate for a normal EEG due to the fact that the patient could not be cleaned.  She was agitated when she was being hooked up.  This provides for a very limited interpretation of the EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal and baclofen.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures include photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record appears to have a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Overall, the quality of the recording, as mentioned before, is poor and there is a large amount of impedance artifact which prevents any clear definitive statements of abnormalities.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None clearly seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
Please note that at times there were some occipital what appears to be lambda waves but it is unclear if this is a pathologic pattern as this is a poor-quality recording.
IMPRESSION:  Limited EEG which appears to be normal awake.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a limited normal awake EEG.  No seizures were seen.
