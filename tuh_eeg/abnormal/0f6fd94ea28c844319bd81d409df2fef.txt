CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old right handed male with childhood epilepsy with recurrent seizures in March 2012.  Tonoclonic seizure with eyes rolling back in the head.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were  performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized at 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing some head rocking artifact and an increase in amplitude of the background.  Rhythmic theta was identified in drowsiness.  Sleep was not sustained and the patient has transitioned between wakefulness and stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response, but the patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In this individual with incomplete control of his epilepsy, a follow up study may be of value.
