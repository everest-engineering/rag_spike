EEG LENGTH:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of Alzheimer's disease who now presents with a generalized tonic clonic convulsion on 06/11/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Exelon patch, aspirin, oxybutynin.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta and delta activity with occasional triphasic wave forms.  No abnormal sleep architecture is captured, however.  The quiescence are noted.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation did not result in additional abnormalities.  Intermittent teeth grinding artifact is present throughout the recording.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Triphasic wave forms.
No seizures.
Teeth grinding artifact.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 23-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and triphasic wave forms.  These findings indicate __________ and nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Triphasic wave forms could be seen in various forms of encephalopathies.  No electrographic seizures were captured.  Intermittent teeth grinding artifact is present and obscures a large portion of the recording.
