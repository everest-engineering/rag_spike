CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old woman with migraine headaches and difficulty
sleeping.
MEDICATIONS: Sinequan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz, 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm. Features of sleep include prominent POSTS followed by
vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving. Hyperventilation produces an
increased amplitude of the background.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be considered. The
patient's vigorous driving response is a normal phenomenon.
