CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old right handed woman with recurrent syncope, past
history of tonic clonic seizures, heart attack, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Quinapril, Procardia, Oxybutynin, isosorbide, ASA, Lovastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake through stage
II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The patient transitions rapidly
between wakefulness and stage II sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and
POSTS. On one occasion as she is transitioning in and out of stage II sleep, during
photic stimulation, it appears that there is new or alpha activity on the right, almost as
there are vertex waves and POSTS. Photic stimulation produces supraharmonic driving
responses which can be differentiated from the patient drifting in and out of sleep, and,
in fact, she has a harmonic that is unusual in that it sometimes to be 3 or 5 times the
frequency of flash stimuli.
HR: 60 bpm with occasional PVC's.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above are interesting and unusual
but not necessarily pathological in nature. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis
of epilepsy. A review of this patient's history may be helpful because significant sleep
deprivation might account for some of the features described above.
