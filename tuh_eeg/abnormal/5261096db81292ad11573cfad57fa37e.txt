CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old left handed woman referred from United Cerebral Palsy and Respite Care.  Two seizures in January.  The patient was hospitalized at Episcopal Hospital and then discharged to her current care home.  Recent involuntary psychiatric hospitalization.
MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft, Zocor, Lamictal, Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient is restless in wakefulness and there is a fair amount of chew artifact.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  There is also some background slowing.  The patient is moving about during photic stimulation and in fact, photic cannot be completed.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  Involuntary movements were noted and these may be part of her psychiatric condition.  If additional information is needed, a sleep-deprived EEG or a 1-hour sleep EEG may be of value.
