CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old left handed woman with an aneurysm repair 12 years ago and a syncopal spell in the past year.

MEDICATIONS: Aricept, Fosamax, Labetalol, Namenda

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized. There is a 9.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving. On rare occasions, in wakefulness, a breech rhythm is identified in the left temporal region and there are bursts of theta frequency activity with mixed theta delta, more prominent on the left than the right.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Bursts of bilateral theta, left greater than right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are noted. Compared to other studies, this EEG actually has an improved background, but EEGs have not been performed for for several years.
