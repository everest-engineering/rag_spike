CLINICAL HISTORY: 7 day old infant born 37 weeks by history, 35 to 36 weeks by exam to mother with eclampsia. Abnormal MRI of the brain suggesting perinatal anoxia. No report of clinical seizures at this time. The technologist reports that the patient has been doing well but was difficult to arouse during the EEG.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside with neonatal mentoring using the neonatal montage with the eye monitor. The child is quite sleepy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slower amplitude than might be anticipated for a neonatal EEG. There are vertex waves observed, delta brushes. There is variability in the record and reactivity. The A1T3 pair demonstrates artifacts. There appears to be some artifact in the left temporal lateral chain. There are a handful of C4 sharp waves as well as O2 sharp waves.

HR: 102 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an infant of this age due to:
1. A lower voltage somewhat more discontinuous record than expected.
2. Occasional O2 sharp waves and rare C4 sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is an improving pattern compared to the previous study. No seizures were recorded. Some of the features described above may be seen in a sick infant but these findings must also be correlated with this patient's MRI findings.
