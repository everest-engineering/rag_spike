CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old female with change in mental status and past medical history of stroke with right-sided weakness, facial droop, and hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, Colace, Seroquel, Ranitidine, Lisinopril, Provigil, Nystatin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode artifact and movement electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm, seen best over the right hemisphere and not over the left with a frequency of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta again seen over the right hemisphere but not the left.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness.  No sleep is recorded.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere, maximum at F7/T3 at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.  At times this focal slowing becomes rhythmic and sharply contoured but no clear epileptiform.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slow waves in the left hemisphere, maximal in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region and is consistent with the known stroke.  No seizures were seen.
