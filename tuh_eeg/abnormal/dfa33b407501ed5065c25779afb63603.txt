CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed female with history of 2 seizures in November 20,2012, now for follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Hydrochlorothiazide.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness. Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta. Wakefulness is only recorded.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  A repeat EEG with deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in eliciting epileptiform discharges.  Please also note that this EEG is no different that the one performed on March 21, 2011.
