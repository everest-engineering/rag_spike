CLINICAL HISTORY: 71 year old right handed woman status post right TICA aneurysm, VP shunt, now with acute encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is somewhat drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a continuous pattern low to medium amplitude with mixed frequency background. There are portions of the record with arousal with beta and theta frequency activity and when the patient becomes drowsy, there is an increase in frontally predominant delta.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Modest background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are noted. The slowing and FIRDA are nonspecific processes and can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy as well as any other diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study may be helpful.
