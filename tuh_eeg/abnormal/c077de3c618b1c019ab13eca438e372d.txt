LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Nearly 28 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 48-year-old man who presented with an episode of right hand numbness followed by lightheadedness, fall (without self injury), and generalized shaking that the patient recalls.  As the shaking progresses, the patient loses consciousness, and subsequently is confused upon awakening.
MEDICATIONS:  No antiseptic medications.  Aspirin, Zofran, oxycodone, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm is consistent with well-formed and modulated 9-9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, and bursts of diffuse theta are observed.  No stage II sleep is captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a mild diffuse symmetrical background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation induces symmetrical occipital driving at medium to high flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates frequent abnormal QRS complexes.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
Abnormal QRS complexes seen on the single EKG lead.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded. If clinical indications for seizures still persist, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  Frequent abnormal QRS complexes are observed on the single EKG lead.
