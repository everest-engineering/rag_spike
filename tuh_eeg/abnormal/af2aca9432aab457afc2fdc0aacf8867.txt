LENGTH OF RECORDING:  23 minutes, 27 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old gentleman with 2 episodes of syncope.  He also is complaining of a frontal headache for the last 2 years.  CT of the brain showed focal encephalomalacia in the right parietal lobe, as well as right cerebellar-tonsillar ectopia.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Lipitor, metoprolol, aspirin, Tylenol, Motrin, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a moderate amplitude well formed and modulated 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  A fast alpha variant is observed.  During drowsiness, diffuse theta is captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving.  A regular cardiac rhythm is captured in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
Regular cardiac rhythm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
