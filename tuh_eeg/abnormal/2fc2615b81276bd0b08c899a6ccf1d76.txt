CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed male with prostate cancer found
postoperatively with a possible seizure characterized by "found in bed by staring".
MEDICATIONS: Strovite, Lisinopril, Lipitor, Prandin, Omeprazole, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 60 mcV posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Features of
drowsiness include slowing of the background and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic
stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting into Stage I sleep with POSTS, but
brief driving response is observed.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If epilepsy is an important consideration
a follow-up study may be needed.
