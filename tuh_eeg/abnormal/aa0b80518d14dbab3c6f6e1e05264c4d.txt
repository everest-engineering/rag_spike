REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 hertz which is reactive to eye opening. Sleep stage I and stage II were seen. Activating procedures were photic stimulation and produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T3/F7 frequently at 2-4 Hz and 20-60 microvolts. At times, it is sharply contoured, but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
