CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed woman status post left parieto frontal craniotomy for meningioma repair now with episodes where her hand migrates up in the air.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Simvastatin, Atenolol, Omeprazole, Loratadine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm identified bilaterally.  There is a breach rhythm noted in the central region, more so on the left than on the right and there is a slight degree of focal slowing in the left central temporal region.
Hyperventilation accentuates focal slowing from the left hemisphere particularly frontal central - central temporal.  Stage 2 sleep includes vertex phase K complexes and spindles.  The breach rhythm is more prominent during sleep.  There is also some more sharply quadrant slowing emerging at P3.  Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not clearly activate the record.  In the sleep record, the area of sharply quadrant slowing can include C3 and/or P3.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere which may be left central parietal in sleep and a little bit more central temporal and anterior temporal in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no sharp waves or spikes noted, although there was some sharply contoured slowing. A 1-hour EEG was requested to try and capture one of this patient's spells, but was not performed.  A follow-up study was requested in an attempt to capture one of her episodes with the arm flutter.
