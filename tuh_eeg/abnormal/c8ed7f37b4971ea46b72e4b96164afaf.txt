CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old male status post gunshot wound in 2008 with post traumatic epilepsy and post traumatic syncope occurring 1-7 times per day.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is attempted. The patient's communication skills are limited.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified bilaterally. There is eye movement and a suggestion of perhaps a skull deformity in the frontal regions bilaterally. A breech rhythm was not noted or a cranial defect was not noted by the tech, however. A small amount of rhythmic frontal theta is noted in the transition to drowsiness, followed by rhythmic vertex waves and then spontaneous arousals. Vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep, followed by spontaneous arousals. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting into stage 1 sleep with POSTS, but there is a scant driving response observed.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. A small amount of rhythmic, frontal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are nonspecific and may be correlated with imaging. No epileptiform features were observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be beneficial.
