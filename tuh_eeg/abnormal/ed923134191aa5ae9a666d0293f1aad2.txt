CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old right handed female with a history of hydrocephalus and pre-maturity presents with new onset seizures and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using  standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which was reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures reveal no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Intermittent focal slowing seen at T6 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild right posterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of intermittent right posterior temporal focal slowing at times with a more posterior field which is consistent with a known lesion in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
