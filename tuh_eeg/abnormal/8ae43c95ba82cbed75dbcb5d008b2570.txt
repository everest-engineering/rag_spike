INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation Is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase In rhythmicity. The first stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
