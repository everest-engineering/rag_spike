CLINICAL HISTORY: 	67 year old woman with bipolar disease,  episode of loss of consciousness with confusion following the use of Wellbutrin. Syncope vs seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Zyprexa, Simvastatin
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF  THE RECORD:  In wakefulness background EEG is appropriately organized with 10 Hz, 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of
low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 	60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed.  Normal electroencephalogram does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Of note, this is markedly improved compared to the previous study when she was admitted to the
hospital.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow-up study may be more intense, but in case this study is markedly improved.
