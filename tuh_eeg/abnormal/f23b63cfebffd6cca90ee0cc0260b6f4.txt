CLINICAL HISTORY:  44 year old right handed woman with past medical history of narcolepsy and sleep apnea, diabetes, intractable seizures and recent status.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Zocor, Topamax, Glipizide, Keppra, Lovenox.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  There is normal frontocentral beta seen.  The patient is captured is wakefulness and drowsiness.
Activating procedures including hyperventilation accentuates focal bitemporal slowing, but photic stimulation does not produce any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen frequently at F8/T4 and independently at F7/T3 throughout the recording.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.  Please note that the focal slow waves mentioned above are accentuated as stated before during hyperventilation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (right more than left), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is also nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or clear epileptiform discharges were seen.
