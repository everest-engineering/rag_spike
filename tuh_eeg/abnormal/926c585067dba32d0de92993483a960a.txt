CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old right handed woman with migraine headaches for the last 3 months, daily headaches with vertigo, evaluate for seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Meclizine.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9-Hz alpha rhythm.   Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm followed by slow rolling eye movements and then central beta with rare vertex waves. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits a low voltage, super harmonic driving response.  The patient starts to transition into stage II sleep during photic stimulation with snore artifact.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  Snore artifact was noted in the EEG.
