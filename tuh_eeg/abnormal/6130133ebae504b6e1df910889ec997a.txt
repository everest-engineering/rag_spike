CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed woman with left sided headache, left PCA infarct, and abrupt onset of right face, arm, and leg weakness.  Past history of seizure at age 6, hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Fioricet, ASA, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the overall EEG is relatively low voltage.  There is generous beta and a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Although visual analysis of the EEG demonstrates a symmetric pattern, digital analysis suggests that there is a bit of asymmetry and slight lack of coherence, as well as the appearance of occasional 1.5 to 3 Hz activity in the left occipital region compared to the right.  Vertex waves are symmetric, although a little posterior.  Spindles are observed in stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep and scant driving is noted.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rare bursts of focal slowing in the left posterior quadrant.
A slight lack of coherence between the 2 hemispheres observed only with digital analysis.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  The focal slowing and the changes in terms of the coherence between the 2 hemispheres support a structural abnormality on the left.
