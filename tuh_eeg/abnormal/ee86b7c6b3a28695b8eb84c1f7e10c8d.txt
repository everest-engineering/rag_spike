CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, PAD, hypertension, asthma, migraine headaches, and frequent bilateral arm movements with confusion. Past history of seizures. Recently treated with 4 mg of Ativan.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. The patient is quite restless, frequently scratching.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 12Hz alpha rhythm.
The patient awakens briefly, but spends much of the time in stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is asleep and does not activate the record.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG primarily in stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The generous beta and the prominent stage 2 sleep are anticipated findings following administration of the Ativan.
