CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old woman found down with low blood glucose and now in change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Zosyn, Vancomycin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a disorganized slow background that consists of bursts of diffuse theta activity which in the posterior region reaches at best a frequency of 7-8 Hz.  In between these bursts of theta activity, there appears to be complete suppression activity that lasts as long as 10 seconds in between bursts.  The bursts consist mainly of theta, delta activity, at times having some vertex-like waves suggestive of stage 1 sleep, although no clear sleep-wake cycle is noted.  During the study, the patient is stimulated and there appears to be a reactivity with the EEG with some faster frequencies and some muscle activity coming through.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Again, generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with intermixed burst suppression lasting up to 10 seconds.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Burst suppression.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of marked cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology, but may be due in part to medications or a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.
