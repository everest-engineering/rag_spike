CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 44-year-old man who was admitted to Temple after an attempted suicide.  He was found down the stairs with sheets around his neck 2 weeks ago.  He has a ventriculostomy in place.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, Lamictal and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and in a hard collar.  Impedances were acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This bedside portable IC record demonstrates an awake individual with generous movement artifact and diffusely slow pattern with a 5-6 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are occasional simple sharp waves seen in right frontal or mid temporal regions.  As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG becomes low voltage and much more featureless.
Heart rate was 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Prominent attenuation in drowsiness.
A handful of simple sharp waves noted on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The diffuse background slowing supports a bihemispheric process.  The simple sharp waves noted on the right may be confounded by the ventric.  No seizures were recorded and previous EEGs were not available at this time.
