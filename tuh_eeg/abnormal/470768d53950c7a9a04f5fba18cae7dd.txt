REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old man with a history of strokes with left-sided weakness, seizures, hepatitis C, and depression.  Last seizure 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital and Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  This was seen best over the left hemisphere.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously over the right hemisphere, maximal at T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz, and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at T3 and independently at C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times, there were sharply contoured.
Heart rate 60.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right continuous mid temporal slowing in addition to occasional left mid temporal and central slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction over the right mid temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal and central region, all of which are likely related to the known strokes.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
