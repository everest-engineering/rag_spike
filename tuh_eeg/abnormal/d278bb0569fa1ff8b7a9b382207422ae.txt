REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old man with a history of seizure followed by left hemiparesis result.
MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor and vitamin B12.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG is performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with an anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  The patient had hyperventilation and photic stimulation performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is a continuous F8 electrode artifact which is occurring intermittently at 1 Hz.  I could not see on the video what the artifact was.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
