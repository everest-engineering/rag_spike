CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old right handed male with recurrent dizzy spells with loss of consciousness and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 10 Hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness includes rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
