LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 44-year-old man with a past medical history of a motor vehicle accident with a result in head trauma on 09/19/2012.  The patient now reports a single episode of staring that lasts for a few seconds.  The patient also complains of seeing (black floaters) intermittently across his visual fields.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  This alpha activity is higher in amplitude over the right.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with higher frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During very brief drowsiness at the end of the recording bursts of diffuse polymorphic theta and delta is captured.  Hyperventilation does not result in significant change in the background.  Stepped stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 24 minute EEG.  The asymmetry of posterior dominant rhythm observed is within normal limits.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, Stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizure persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
