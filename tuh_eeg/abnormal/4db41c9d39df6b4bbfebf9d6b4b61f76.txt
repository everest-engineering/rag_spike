CLINICAL HISTORY:  80 year old left handed female presenting with syncope and fall.  She passed out and fell down the stairs with bladder incontinence.  Past medical history significant for GI bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension and osteoarthritis.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Tylenol, Lovenox.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG.  The patient was recording during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is, however, intermittent focal slowing on the right anterior temporal region.  The patient appears to go to stage 1 and 2 sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slowing at right anterior temporal region maximum at F8 and T4.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent focal slowing at F8 and T4.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Intermittent focal slowing at the left anterior temporal region could contribute to the focal cerebral pathology which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
