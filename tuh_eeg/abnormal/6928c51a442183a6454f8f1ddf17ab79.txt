CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old woman with epilepsy following intracerebral hemorrhage,
now with increasing right sided weakness and worsening language.  Past history of craniotomy on the right.

MEDICATIONS:  Codeine, Trileptal, Crestor, ASA

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.  Technically this EEG is remarkable for a great deal of muscle and motion artifact.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat poorly organized. There is also a great degree of muscle artifact.  Superimposed upon this are bursts of rhythmic and arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere.   The activity from the right frontal region tends to be rhythmic delta activity.  Underlying sharp waves are noted in this sharply contoured record and include T4/C4 and FP2. Features of drowsiness include additional bursts of paroxysmal high amplitude delta with an underlying right frontal sharp wave.	Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR:   84 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	FIRDA.
2. 	Paroxysmal slowing in the right frontal region.
3.	Sharp waves from the right, many of which are frontal, but some of which are temporal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous study with both a right hemispheric  process and background slowing and disorganization.  This is the first EEG in 1.5 years.  The patient had been relatively seizure free since February 2008.
