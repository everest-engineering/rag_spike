CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old man with mental retardation, gastritis, seizures, high cholesterol, presents with seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote, Klonopin, Compazine, Zantac, Lamictal.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Throughout the recording, the patient continued to move and despite wrapping the head, there was still marked amount of movement and electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a slightly disorganized background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz and appears to be reactive to eye opening.  In the central region, there is a lack of normal beta and rather is a theta frequency seen excessively throughout wakefulness.  Patient does not achieve sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Excessive theta in wakefulness at a frequency of 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-30 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this is a limited EEG due to the marked amount of artifact.  However, it is difficult for the patient to cooperate without any sedation.
