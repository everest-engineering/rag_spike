CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed female with history of seizures since 2010.  Her drop attacks have stopped but now has episodes where not feeling right and feels tired.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Celexa.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.   Wakefulness in stage I sleep were recorded.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined 9-10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, 20-60 microvolts with normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation does not reveal any abnormal discharges.  Sleep stage I is seen.
HR:    66 bpm
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow wave seen at T3 frequently at times with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and at times with a sharply contoured morphology, but not clearly pathologic.
Focal slow waves seen at T4 infrequently at 2-4 Hz and 20-60 microvolts amplitude.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
independent right temporal focal slow waves left much more than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral temporal regions (left more than right), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.  Please note that this EEG shows marked difference from the previous EEG performed 03/16/2010, where frontally predominant spike and wave activity was seen.
