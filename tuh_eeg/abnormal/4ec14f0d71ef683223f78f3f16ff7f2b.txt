LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a history of a traumatic brain injury and subsequent seizures.  Her seizures are characterized as loss of consciousness, urinary incontinence, and generalized convulsions lasting approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta and delta are observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and results in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
