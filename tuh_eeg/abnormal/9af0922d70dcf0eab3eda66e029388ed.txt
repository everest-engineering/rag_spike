CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, seven seizures this past week described as syncopal spells with tongue biting and nocturnal seizures.  Family history of epilepsy on the father's side.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was attempted in an adult female with a hair weave and significant scalp glue.  The technologist has a great deal of difficulty attaching the electrodes.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of frontal central slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with brief EPOC of sleep with POSTS, spindles, and K-complexes. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is transitioning in and out of sleep.  It does not activate the record.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this individual with frequent seizures, a video EEG monitoring session should be undertaken.
