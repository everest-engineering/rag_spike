CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old just left male with epilepsy admitted following 2 seizures with eyes rolling up, banging his head against the sofa and stiffening. He has a past history of alcohol abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins, the patient is quite drowsy with primarily a beta frequency background. Stimulation of the patient produces an arousal. An attempt was made to perform hyperventilation, not successfully. In brief wakefulness an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm is identified followed by a transition back to a drowsy state. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed. Please call the lab for additional EEG studies. Of note, a single previous EEG showed mild abnormalities with some shifting and slowing and hyperventilation noted on December 2010, but neither of the EEGs to date has identified epileptiform activity.
