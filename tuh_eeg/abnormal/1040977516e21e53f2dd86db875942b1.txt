REASON FOR STUDY:  Recurrent seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 31-year-old woman who was seizure free for 15 years, now with new onset seizure for 5-6 months where she has her eyes roll up, body shaking lasting for 10 minutes.  No incontinence or tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient has no abnormal discharges during photic stimulation.  The majority of the recording is in sleep as the patient drifts off quickly during the recording.  Stage I and stage II sleep are recorded.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
There was one rhythmic frontal delta discharge during sleep that is likely part of sleep, but has a slightly suspicious morphology.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
