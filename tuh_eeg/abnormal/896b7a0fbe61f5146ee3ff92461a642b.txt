CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old left handed male admitted on August 7 with worsening language dysfunction.  Primary brain tumor status post gamma knife therapy.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Decadron, Lantus, Glyburide, Pantoprazole, Levetiracetam, Actos, Lipitor, Paroxetine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the activity from the right hemisphere is well organized with a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  The alpha rhythm on the left is somewhat slower in frequency and is intermittently disrupted.  Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing. As the patient becomes drowsier, the arrhythmic delta from the left mid to anterior temporal region is noted.  There is a breach rhythm with artifacts picked up at T3 and F7.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.   The patient has prominent myogenic artifact at T3.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left temporal focal slowing characterized by arrhythmic delta.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are in the region of the patient's previous craniotomy, as is the breach rhythm.  There were no definitive sharp waves, but given
the breach rhythm and other artifacts, a sleep EEG might be necessary to more clearly identify epileptiform activity.
