CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed male with history of seizures, hypertension, CHF, and right sided weakness, as well as headache and confusion was on Dilantin at home.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Hydralazine, Lovenox, Famotidine, ASA.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Headache and confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation, was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz with some normal frontal central beta seen.  The patient appears to go into stage I and stage II sleep. Activating procedure, which was photic stimulation, produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Very frequent, almost continuous, focal slowing present at T3 at 2-4 Hz and 20-70 mV.  At one time there is 2 sharply contoured transients in this region, but not clearly epileptiform.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
