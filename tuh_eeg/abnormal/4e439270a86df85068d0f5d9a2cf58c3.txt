Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T3 muscle electrical artifact seen intermittently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness only.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 76.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
