LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed using standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures.  Her last seizure occurred two to three weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra and Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a low __________ modulated 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  __________ posterior frequency with subsequent frequency of low amplitude anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent left temporal theta delta activity is observed.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent moderate left temporal slowing.
Epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 21-minute EEG due to intermittent left temporal moderate slowing.  This finding indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy .
