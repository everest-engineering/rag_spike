CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male with episodes of severe body tremors lasting 5 to 7 days without impairment of awareness.
MEDICATIONS: Klonopin,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is somewhat drowsy. He is experiencing a lot of shivering or muscle twitching as the recording begins.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a well-organized pattern with generous beta and a 12 Hz alpha. Features of drowsiness include an increase in theta. Despite the muscle artifact, the patient drifts briefly into stage II sleep with vertex waves and spindles. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. There is some movement artifact and photic stimulation.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and the patient did appear to be having his symptoms during the EEG.
