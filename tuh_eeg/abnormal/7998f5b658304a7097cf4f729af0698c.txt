CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old woman admitted this past weekend with possible new stroke and seizure, shaking movements of the right arm and leg.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Lisinopril, Aspirin, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is somewhat somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an asymmetry.  There is more alpha and theta frequency activity from the right hemisphere.  Left hemisphere is a bit slower.  The right hemisphere demonstrates arrhythmic delta activity and some sharply contoured slowing on the right.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
An interhemispheric asymmetry with a lower voltage pattern on the left.
Sharply contoured activity on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG demonstrates a bihemispheric process with each hemisphere having different features.  Correlation with imaging is important, but
the epileptiform focus may not be ipsilateral to the acute stroke if the acute stroke is on the left.
