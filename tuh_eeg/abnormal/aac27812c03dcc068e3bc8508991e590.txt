CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with hepatitis C, liver transplant. Now with altered mental status and lethargy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Oxycodone, Cipro, Oxycontin, Lasix, Spironolactone, Prednisone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a continuous pattern of mixed rhythmic theta and delta with a pattern of 2 to6 Hz activity. Much of the activity is rhythmic theta. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in muscle and a scant increase in alpha frequency activity.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to
1. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The rhythmic background slowing is nonspecific and can be seen in diffuse disturbance of cerebral function including toxic or metabolic encephalopathy. No epileptiform features were observed. These findings may be compared to previous studies.
