CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 27-year-old with severe chronic static encephalopathy, microcephalic, no seizures in the past year.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Tegretol, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was not able to cooperate with formal testing during the EEG, is awake, and has continuous mouth movements, chewing on the ring on the left hand.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The current EEG is markedly abnormal, but includes a continuous pattern.  There is a paucity of cerebral activity in the posterior region and there is rhythmic theta and some alpha, and even some beta activity noted in the frontal region.  Prominent eye movement artifact is noted and there is prominent blinking as well.  There is an asymmetry noted in the record with a bit more frontal theta noted in the left frontal region, some of which includes a sharply contoured complex.  At times some of this a bit more symmetric.
Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Absence of the normal developmental wave forms for an adult of this age.
Relative paucity of cerebral activity in the posterior regions.
Frontally predominant theta, some of which is sharply contoured and may represent an inter ictal epileptiform discharge.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG, April 26, 2007, the previous EEG identified right frontal sharp waves and paroxysmal slowing.  This is a similar pattern.
