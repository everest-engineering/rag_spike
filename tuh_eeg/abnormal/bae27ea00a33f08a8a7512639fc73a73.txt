MEDICATIONS: Paxil, Topamax, Lisinopril, ASA, Norvasc, Propranolol, Xalatan, Amlodipine.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm, frequent eye flutter is noted. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background with an increase in theta and a decrease in the eye flutter. Wicket is noted. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving with a supraharmonic driving response at intermediate flash frequencies.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Eye flutter is sometimes a manifestation of anxiety.
