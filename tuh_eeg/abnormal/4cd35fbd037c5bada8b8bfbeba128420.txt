CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, status post aneurysm surgery including a clip and left craniotomy today. The patient has a number of clear cut seizures in the recovery room treated with Ativan and propofol, now unresponsive with ocular fluttering.
MEDICATIONS : Keppra, Depakote, Ativan, midazolam, propofol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. The EEG is a routine 20 minute recording. The patient is intubated, appears comatose and with careful review of the video, she has right ocular twitching.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a status epilepticus pattern. It starts with a slow, suppressed pattern on the right and repetitive sharp waves on the left at T1 and F7. These demonstrate frequency evolution with rhythmic 3 Hz to 4 Hz activity in the left frontocentral regions. There is clear build up and slow down of the epileptiform activity noted at 4:02 and again at 4:07 and throughout the record. The patient has received benzodiazepines for epileptiform activity which has not completely abated.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Status epilepticus pattern with recurrent seizures from left frontocentral and frontotemporal region.
2. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Diagnostic of status epilepticus.
