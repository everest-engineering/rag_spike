DATE OF RECORDING:  07/25/2013 from approximately 9 a.m. until 07/26/2013 until approximately 9 a.m.
TOTAL LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  A little bit over 12 hours.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old woman with a history of medically refractory complex partial seizures currently admitted for presurgical evaluation.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Lyrica off, Vimpat off.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard 10-20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  The patient was equipped with the event button.  Nursing staff notes and medical staff notes were reviewed.  The recording was paused at approximately 11 p.m. until approximately 7:30 a.m. due to equipment malfunction.  The recording was reviewed intermittently by an attending neurologist.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical sleep spindles, vertex waves, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), slow wave sleep and REM sleep are captured.  Occasional minimal polymorphic theta activity is captured over the left temporal region.  No typical events or seizures captured.
FINDINGS:
No events or seizures.
Occasional mild left temporal slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal continuous audio video 12-hour electroencephalogram  monitoring due to occasional mild left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction, likely structural in etiology.  No events
or seizures captured.  Of note, the recording was paused from approximately 11 p.m. until approximately 7:30 a.m. due to system malfunction.
