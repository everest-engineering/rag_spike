CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed male with an episode of bilateral shaking lasting 5 minutes with drooling which was followed by postictal confusion, this occurred after a tooth infection which required treatment with Vicodin.
MEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Motrin, Dulcet, Vicodin, Penicillin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes low voltage background with a well-defined 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The patient appears to be drowsy drifting into stage I and stage II sleep rapidly and is in stage II sleep during photic stimulation which does not otherwise activate the record. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude in the background.
HR: 48 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. Additional evaluation for the bradycardia may be appropriate.
