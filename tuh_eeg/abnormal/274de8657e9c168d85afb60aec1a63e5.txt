CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old female with epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not performed but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Post and vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. There is a single burst of slowing from the left noted in sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. There is a single burst of slowing on the left which must be considered artifactual. This is the most likely conclusion particular as the vertex waves suggest it. Scalp electrode placement was suboptimal. If additional information is needed, a repeat study with more prolonged sleep may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
