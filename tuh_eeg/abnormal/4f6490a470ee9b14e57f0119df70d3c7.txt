INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is described as somewhat disinhibited.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta. The patient is described as occasionally tense and as she tenses up, there is an increase in muscle artifact. Features of stage I sleep include vertex waves and spindles. The patient seems to stiffen up or to become tense and then drops into stage II sleep.
