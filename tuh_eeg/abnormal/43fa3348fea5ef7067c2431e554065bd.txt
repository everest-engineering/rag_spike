CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed male with epilepsy since age 21. Seizures described as slight episodes of dizziness, shaking a bit of spell without loss of consciousness or falling which last 15 to 20 minutes.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Folate Acid, Ibuprofen, Phenytoin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat slow and disorganized with excess theta and an alpha rhythm of 7 Hz to 8 Hz. Shifting slowing is identified in the posterior regions and occasionally in the right hemisphere. In a transition to sleep, bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing are observed.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
2. Background slowing.
3. Disorganization.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. The pattern described above may be due to the patient's lifelong epilepsy or to an age related process. If further characterization of the seizures is needed, a more prolonged EEG in the Lab is suggested. Alternatively, comparison with his previous EEGs over the course of decades could provide helpful information.
