CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes, and left ACA infarct, right-sided weakness, patient recently suffered 2 generalized tonic-clonic seizures with prolonged postictal state.  The patient is in Room 772.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is quite slow, with a mixture of theta and delta.  Superimposed upon this are bursts of sharply contoured slowing and occasional sharp waves or sharply contoured delta maximum at T1 or T3.  As the recording continues, the patient starts to wake up a bit spontaneously with the appearance of alpha frequency activity in the background, right greater than left, and a posterior dominant rhythm of 8 Hz on the right, a bit disrupted on the left.  When unstimulated the patient starts to transition into a sleep pattern but overall, as the recording continues, the overall background is improving and the patient starts to transition to more of a stage 1, stage 2 sleep pattern.
At the end of the record, the patient is talking, there is an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity, although the patient is confused.
Heart rate 116 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal but dynamic record due to:
Bilateral, significant background slowing noted early in the record which improved over time.
Left temporal focal slowing or left hemispheric focal slowing.
Sharp waves seen at T3 and T1.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the fifth EEG for this patient.  It is better organized at the end of record than previous studies.  No seizures were recorded.  And the epileptiform activity and the background slowing are significantly less prominent than in some previous studies.  The best fit for this EEG is a postictal pattern in a patient who is improving.
