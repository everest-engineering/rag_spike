CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old left handed male with increased episodes of
sleepiness, dizziness and olfactory hallucinations. Two year history of these symptoms.

MEDICATIONS: Benicar.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm
which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Hyperventilation does not activate the
record. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving heart rate at 72 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important
consideration, a follow up study in the lab capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of
value.
