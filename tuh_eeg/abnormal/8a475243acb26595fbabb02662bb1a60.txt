CLINICAL HISTORY:   37 year old woman requires neurologic clearance for foot surgery. Seizure free for the last 2 years.

MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, background EEG includes a well organized 9.5 hertz 40 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR:   78 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features noted in this record. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing sleep may be of use.
