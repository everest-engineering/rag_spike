CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed female with complex partial epilepsy, seizure free for many years.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Amlodipine, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a very subtle asymmetry with disruption of faster frequency activity in the right frontal temporal region. In addition, as the patient becomes drowsy there is more clear rhythmic slowing in the right frontal temporal region and a single sharp wave. Hyperventilation subtly accentuates the focal features. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Mild abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle, slowing from the right frontal temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional process in the right. No sharp waves were identified. This is one of many EEGs for this patient.
