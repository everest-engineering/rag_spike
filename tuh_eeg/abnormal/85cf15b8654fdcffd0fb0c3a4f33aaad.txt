CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed woman with anxiety disorder who developed epilepsy in 2010 with multiple tonic clonic seizures.  Seizures are exacerbated by stress, grief, and loss of health care.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Xanax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11.7 Hz 66 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing sleep may be of value.
