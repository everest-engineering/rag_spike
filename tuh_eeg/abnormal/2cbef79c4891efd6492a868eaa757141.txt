CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old left handed gentleman who reports depression after
his mother passed away in 1986 but denies seizures or episodes of loss of
consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta
followed by vertex waves and POSTS. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of
slowing. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage 2
sleep.
HR: 66 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed.
Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
