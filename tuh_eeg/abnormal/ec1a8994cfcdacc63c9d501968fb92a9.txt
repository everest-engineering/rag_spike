LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 23-year-old man with 2 episodes of seizures.  Episodes occurred after the patient abruptly stopped taking Xanax.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Lambda activities occasional insert.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and BETS are noted.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and does not produce significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 26-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
