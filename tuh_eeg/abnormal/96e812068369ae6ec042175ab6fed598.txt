CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old woman status post code February 25, 2010, now
with facial twitching. Past history of dementia and other multiple medical problems.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Lexapro, Glipizide, Lexapro, Enalapril, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage
theta pattern. The record is Intermittently discontinuous. The patient has intermittent
turning of the head and this is associated with a small amount of myoclonus. The
pattern is more of a generalized pattern, but it does seem to localize to the parietal
region, right greater than left. Stimulation of the patient seems to increase the
myoclonus.
HR: 80-100 bpm and Irregular
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Burst suppression pattern.
2. Absence of clear very active to stimulation aside from stimulus induced myoclonus.
3. Myoclonus associated with focal epileptiform activity in the parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings carry a worrisome prognosis in the context
of anoxia. The pattern is not as vigorous as last week raising concerns for significant
CNS pathology. Additional prognostic studies may be appropriate.
