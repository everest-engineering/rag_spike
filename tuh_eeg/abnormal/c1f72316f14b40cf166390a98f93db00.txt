CLINICAL HISTORY: 86 year old right handed female, diagnosis completed stroke with change in mental status, dementia and confusion. This is an inpatient EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. There was no hyperventilation. As the tracing begins the patient is awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hertz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is occasional left greater than right temporal theta and delta and in relaxed wakefulness rare left temporal sharp waves. As the patient becomes drowsy there is a little bit more rhythmic theta in the left frontocentral region. Photic stimulation elicits a harmonic driving response.
HR: 60-90 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing from the left hemisphere, particularly frontocentral, frontotemporal.
2. Rare left anterior temporal sharp waves with slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the context of this patient's age, the background is well organized. This EEG supports a structural process on the left.
