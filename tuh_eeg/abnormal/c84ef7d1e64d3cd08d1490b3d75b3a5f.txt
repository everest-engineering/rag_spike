CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old right handed woman with tuberous sclerosis, lupus nephritis, brain resection at age 7, expressive aphasia, hospitalized since August with a seizure on October 11, 2011.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Vimpat, Metoprolol, Pantoprazole, Clonidine, Acetazolamide, Solu Medrol, Albuterol, Ativan
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at  bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG for this intubated, bedside portable ICU record, demonstrates a pattern with generous beta.  The patient is awake.  Rhythmic, slow delta is noted in the right hemisphere of approximately 2 Hz.  It is generally diffuse to the right hemisphere, but is also picked up in the left occipital region.  Although it waxes and wanes, no clinical seizures are noted.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Absence of a normal wave forms for an adult of this age.
Right rhythmic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The EEG is similar to a previous study on August 29, 2011.
