CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed female status post cavernoma hemorrhage and craniotomy for right cerebellar cavernoma now with headaches and 1 seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Protonix, Flexeril
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were performed including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen at F7/T3 and F8/T4 independently occurring only occasionally at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bitemporal, anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal serial dysfunction in both anterior bitemporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
