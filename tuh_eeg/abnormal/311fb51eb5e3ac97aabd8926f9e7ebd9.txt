CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old male with epilepsy.  The patient reports tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and confusion, last seizure 1 month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Abundant stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K complexes, spindles were noted.  There is a slight asymmetry in the vertex waves, compatible with head measurement.  Hyperventilation is performed while the patient is drifting off into sleep.  No epileptiform features were identified.
Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep.  No driving response was noted.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is likely a normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The minor asymmetries noted in stage 2 sleep are compatible with a slight asymmetry in electrode placement.  In this individual, whose tonic-clonic seizures are not controlled, additional EEG recording may be of value.
