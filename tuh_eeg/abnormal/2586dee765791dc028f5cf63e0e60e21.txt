CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old right handed male with adult-onset epilepsy, last seizure 1 month ago.  The patient has a 2-day aura of déjà vu before he has a seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Enalapril, Lipitor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness and in hyperventilation, there is rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity in the right temporal region.  Some of this occurs in bursts, but without definitive frequency evolution.  The bursts of rhythmic temporal theta delta may be associated with right temporal sharp waves.  In hyperventilation, the alpha rhythm is also disrupted relative to the alpha on the contralateral side.  Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the right temporal slowing and sharp waves.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response a little bit more vigorous on the left than the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent rhythmic right temporal focal slowing.
Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Features described above are characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy.  No seizures were recorded, although this was a very rhythmic and irritative process.
