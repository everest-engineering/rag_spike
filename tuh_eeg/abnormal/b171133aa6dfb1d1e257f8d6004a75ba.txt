CLINICAL HISTORY:  78 year old woman status post PEA code for 40 minutes, then 6 minutes in the emergency room, now with episodes of diffuse body shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Atropine, Lasix, Lipitor, Hydralazine, Pantoprazole
REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonus.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was unresponsive during the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some sweat artifact and movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record has a diffusely slow background in between the bursts that I will describe in the next paragraph.  She has a markedly suppressed background with no clear electrocerebral activity.  However, this is in between much artifact which makes it difficult to make any clear final determinations about electrical activity.  In addition, she has bursts of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges with frontal predominant sharp waves and polyspikes that appear to at times increase in rhythmicity to a frequency of about 4-5 Hz and last for about 30-40 seconds.  During these bursts, which are usually symmetric, but at times slightly asymmetric, the patient appears to be clinically shaking and twitching and jerking.  These are consistent with myoclonic jerks.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  As above.
SEIZURES:  Multiple myoclonic seizures as described above.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Frequent myoclonic seizures of prolonged duration in between markedly abnormal suppressed background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cortical injury and irritability with multiple bursts of generalized periodic discharges and associated jerks consistent with myoclonic seizures.  The interictal pattern as well as the presence of myoclonus in the setting of hypoxic injury suggests a very poor prognosis.
