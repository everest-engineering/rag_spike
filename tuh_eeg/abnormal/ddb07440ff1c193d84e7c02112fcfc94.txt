CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 66-year-old woman with history of epilepsy.  The patient repeatedly stops seizure medicine.  Ran out of Keppra and has had multiple spells.  Two to 4 seizures per month.
MEDICATIONS:  Imitrex, Fosamax, and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Occasional bursts of shifting and flowing are noted from the right or left temporal regions.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmicity of the background followed by post and subtle vertex waves.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep but a driving response was obtained.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing.
Disorganization.
Shifting and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to a previous study made 2011 but there is a little bit more background slowing and shifting slowing.  Correlation with clinical history and imaging is important for this older adult with multiple medical problems.
