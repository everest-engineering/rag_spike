CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 58-year-old left-handed gentleman with history of seizure-like activity.  He had 4 episodes since 2004, last episode was on 01/13/2013, described as a weakness episode as bloody shaking, foaming at the mouth, and tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm and slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 55-60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording, capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
