LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old man with a seizure disorder since 1968.  His seizures are characterized by loss of consciousness with associated postictal confusion.  His last seizure was approximately a year and a half ago, possibly more.  This EEG is being performed to evaluate for withdrawal of seizure medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated very low amplitude 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Voltages are diffusely very low.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, bursts of diffuse theta and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are observed.  Stage II sleep is not achieved.  Hyperventilation results in mild diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
