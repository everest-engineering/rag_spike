LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old woman who now presents with change in mental status.  The patient has a past medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, COPD, and non-epileptic events.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a low amplitude polymorphic theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  A regular heart rate is noted in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
No sleep.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 23-minute study due to mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction. The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
