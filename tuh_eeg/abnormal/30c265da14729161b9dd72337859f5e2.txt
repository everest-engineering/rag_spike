CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old right handed woman with a left MCA stroke, right-sided weakness, and hypertension.  Admitted with seizure characterized by right gaze deviation.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, Dilantin, Protonix, Lisinopril, Norvasc, ASA, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the awake EEG demonstrates asymmetry.  There is a glimpse of an 8 Hz alpha rhythm on the right which is disrupted on the left.  The faster frequency activity is disrupted on the left in the left temporal region relative to the right.  In addition, there is somewhat periodic arrhythmic delta activity with a complex field of spread in the left temporal region.  It may start left mid temporal or posterior temporal and then spread to the left hemisphere, particularly centrotemporal regions or the left posterior temporal area.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there are some bursts of frontal delta bilaterally.  Other features of drowsiness include an accentuation of the left temporal focal slowing. Rare left temporal sharp waves maximum at T1-T3 are observed.  Photic stimulation elicits driving.  Heart rate 104 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A slightly slow and disorganized record on the right.
Arrhythmic delta in the left hemisphere with some poorly formed periodic complexes in the left.
Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural or functional process on the left, involving gray and white matter.  These sharp waves are congruent with the prior left MCA infarct.  This EEG is similar to 2 prior EEGs for this patient.
