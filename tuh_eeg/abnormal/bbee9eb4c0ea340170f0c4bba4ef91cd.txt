CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old with epilepsy since childhood.  The patient was a limited historian, but seizures include loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  Previous seizures earlier this week.  Last seizure prior to October 25 was July 12.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is both excess beta and excess theta noted in the record.  Although there is some technical issues, including muscle artifact for a patient who has difficulty relaxing, there is excess theta and minor shifting asymmetries.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Drowsiness produces an increase in the rhythmicity of the background.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Mild excess theta.
Mild excess beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The excess beta and theta may be postictal findings.  Comparison with previous EEGs may be of value.
