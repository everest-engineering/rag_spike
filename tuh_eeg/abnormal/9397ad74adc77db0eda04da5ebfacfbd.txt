CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old right handed man with a history of seizures after a trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior, temporal, and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low-voltage well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 8.5 to 9 Hz with an amplitude of 20-15 microvolts, which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   No seizures nor epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that this EEG is different from the previous reports where left temporal slowing was seen.
