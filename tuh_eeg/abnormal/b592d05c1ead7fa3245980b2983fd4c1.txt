CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old gentleman with breakthrough tonic clonic seizures lasting 5 minutes. Postictal confusion. 2-3 tonic clonic seizures per month.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, Flexeril, Valproic Acid

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In the initial sections of the record, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized but as the recording continues, the overall organization improves with an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior side of the alpha rhythm with vertex waves noted in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record. By the close of the record, there is a little bit of shifting slowing in the right or left frontal region. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.

HR: 72 bpm with an abnormal QRS complex.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Disorganization noted early on the record improving as time goes on.
2. Transient, shifting frontal slowing, again improving as time goes on.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The transient features may be part of this patient's postictal state. No epileptiform features were observed. Additional evaluation for the EKG is appropriate.
