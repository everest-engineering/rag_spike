LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures.  She has not had any seizures recently.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Trileptal.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates but stage II sleep is not achieved.  Intermittent bursts of theta and delta activity are captured over the bitemporal regions.  Activity within these bursts is often sharply contoured; however, no clear sharp waves are observed within these bursts of slowing.  Additionally, there is significant EMG artifact during some parts of the recording and epileptic activity could have been missed as a result of this.
FINDINGS:
No sleep.
Intermittent moderate bitemporal slowing, often sharply contoured.
No clear epileptiform discharges; however, portions of the recording contain significant EMG artifact and epileptiform discharges could have been missed.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and drowsy EEG due to moderate bitemporal slowing that is often sharply contoured.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured; however, portions of the recording contain significant EMG artifact and epileptiform discharges could have been missed.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep and less artifact could be of benefit.
