CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old woman with basilar aneurysm, multiple infarcts,
visual impairment, episode of twitching with roaming at the mouth on Saturday.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lovenox, Protonix, ASA
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system or electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite somnolent
initially but awake at the close of the record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation -are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background includes
a pattern rich in beta frequency activity. As she becomes slightly drowsy, more
prominent background slowing is noted with shifting slowing, more significant arrhythmic
delta activity on the right compared to the left. Temporal wicket is observed. Vertex
waves are noted in sleep. Beta asymmetries are noted in sleep.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
I. Prominent shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal features may be correlated with imaging. There
were no definitive epileptiform features.
