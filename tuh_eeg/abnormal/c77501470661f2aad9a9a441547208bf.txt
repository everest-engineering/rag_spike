CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with new onset seizures and a
blood sugar of 500. Seizures are characterized by focal left jerking and spasms. The
patient reported no loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: Insulin, unknown HTN meds.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in theta. Vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep followed
by arousal. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Photic stimulation elicits
bilateral driving. The patient starts the transition into stage II sleep with vertex waves
and spindles during the photic stimulation.
HR: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. A
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
