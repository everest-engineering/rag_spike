MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Keppra, Zocor
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were deferred.
OF THE RECORD: The patient seems to be relatively drowsy
throughout the EEG. The overall background in drowsiness is a bit slow with a 6 hertz
theta pattern. Arousals are characterized by some frontal10 hertz activity. In brief
wakefulness, an alpha rhythm is identified which is 9.5 hertz, 50 microvolts. The patient
transitions in and out of a drowsy state with an increase in beta, attenuation of the alpha
rhythm and at some point, some increase in some frontal fast activity. Vertex waves,
POSTS and brief spindles are noted in stage II sleep.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG:
CLINICAL No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this
record. If additional information is needed, a followup study with hyperventilation and
photic stimulation can be obtained.
