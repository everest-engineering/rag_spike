REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system of electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Losartan, amlodipine, atorvastatin.
HISTORY:  A 69-year-old woman with history of seizures on Dilantin eager to stop medications.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedure included photic stimulation performed which revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow wave seen frequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz an amplitude of 20-50 mV.
Focal sharp waves seen rarely at F7/T3 and this is seen in wakefulness and sleep.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate:  60.  At times appears to be slightly irregular with also 1 extra atrial premature complex noted.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal slowing and sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
