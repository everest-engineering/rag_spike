CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old woman with refractory epilepsy since age 30, obstructive sleep apnea, and morbid obesity.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tegretol,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of background theta. Eye movement artifact is picked up in wakefulness I on the anterior temporal electrodes, but there is also some left temporal irregular slowing and sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include an increase in synchronicity or arrhythmicity of the background. followed by brief vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In maximal wakefulness the background EEG is well organized and at the end of the record, maximal wakefulness is-characterized by 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm. In this individual with obstructive sleep apnea, some of the background theta may represent a drowsy pattern. The left temporal focal features, including sharp waves in wakefulness and sleep, have been previously described.
