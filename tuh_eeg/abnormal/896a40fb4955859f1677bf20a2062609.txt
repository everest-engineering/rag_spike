CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old male with a syncopal episode March 2, 2010.
MEDICATIONS: ASA, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric, 10.5 alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of alpha rhythm and the appearance of POSTS as well as vertex waves. Sleep is not sustained. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving response.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptic form features are observed in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration a repeat tracing can be considered.
