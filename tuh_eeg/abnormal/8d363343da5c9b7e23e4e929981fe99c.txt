CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 86-year-old with cognitive impairment and an episode of dizziness, vomiting and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  ASA, Aricept, others
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not possible but photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is a bit slow and disorganized with a 7.5 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background with slow rolling eye movements.  Occasional, isolated shifting slowing was noted.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.  Heart rate 78 bpm, occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG for adult of this age due to:
Slowing of the background rhythm.
Mild background disorganization.
Shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The features described above are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of  dementia.
