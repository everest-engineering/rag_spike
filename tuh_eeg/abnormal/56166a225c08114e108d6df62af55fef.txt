CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old right-handed woman with petit mal epilepsy since August 1983, last seizure December 2012.  Patient recalls episodes of passing out, loss of consciousness, and incontinence, sometimes biting her tongue.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Zyrtec, Benadryl, Mucinex, tramadol, Klonopin, ibuprofen.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep and elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation produced epileptiform activity.  If epilepsy is an important consideration or if additional information is needed, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
