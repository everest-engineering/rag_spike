CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old left handed male with an episode of loss of consciousness, followed by confusion, neck pain, and arm pain associated with a fall.
MEDICATIONS:   Hydrocodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is low voltage, but well organized with symmetric reactive 9 Hz alpha rhythm and generous frontal, central beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta described above for the patient can be associated with anxiety or medication effect.
