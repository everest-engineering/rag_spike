CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old female transferred to the hospital after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at an outside hospital, transferred for change in mental status, questionable sedative effect from overdose of medication, and positive alcohol abuse.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while she was unresponsive or mildly responsive to stimulation.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with an intermixed overlying mainly frontal but diffusely appearing beta frequency rhythm.  This EEG does not reveal any normal posterior dominant rhythm or sleep architecture.  There are intermittent bursts of diffuse slowing where the beta dissipates but comes back at times.  The patient is stimulated and there appears to be no improvement in the frequencies of the EEG.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Overlying diffuse beta rhythm that is not reactive to stimulation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Increased beta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific with regard to etiology; however, in this case the overlying beta seen throughout the recording is suggestive of medication-induced encephalopathy,
sometimes seen with benzodiazepines or barbiturates and at times with lithium.  No seizures were seen.
