CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old woman with new-onset tonic clonic seizures and 3 minutes of postictal confusion. New onset seizures yesterday.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with1 channel of EKG. The patient appears drowsy and is not able to cooperate with hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of theta. The patient drifts off into sleep and a lower voltage slow pattern is noted. In the transition out of sleep, there are bursts of beta activity in the central regions which are relatively symmetric but there are also some
bursts of 8 Hz activity in the left frontotemporal region. This activity is seen as the patient transitions towards stage 2 sleep with abundant vertex waves, K complexes, spindles, and POSTS. The patient transitions in and out of stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation does arouse the patient but does not produce a driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This individual has left temporal wicket which is considered a normal finding. There are no definitive epileptiform features. The activity is a bit more prominent than is sometimes noted but there is not a great deal of wicket overall and if epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up, outpatient EEG may be helpful.
