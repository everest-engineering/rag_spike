LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis, who had right-sided Bell's palsy several years ago, now with intermittent right facial twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include baclofen, alprazolam, Zolpidem, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 to 9-1/2 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the background voltage attenuates and symmetrical vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.  A single EKG lead indicates a heart rate of approximately 100 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
