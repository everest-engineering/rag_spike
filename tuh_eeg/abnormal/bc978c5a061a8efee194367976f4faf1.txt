CLINICAL HISTORY:   34 year old right handed man with a history of HIV, hepatitis C, and prior stroke in 2010.  He presents with new onset of seizure, described as generalized tonic clonic and postictal confusion.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone, Trazodone, highly active antiretroviral therapy.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and drowsiness was recorded.  Activation procedures, including photic stimulation were performed.  No hyperventilation was performed.
CLINICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Increased temporalis muscle artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 mV, which is reactive to eye opening and closing.  There is slightly more moderately increased amount of frontal central beta. Drowsiness in stage I is seen for a short period of time. Photic stimulation was performed with no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
