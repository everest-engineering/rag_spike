LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
INTRODUCTION:  Conditions of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 90-year-old woman who presents with an episode of speech arrest and generalized weakness.  The patient was also noted to have shaking in both upper extremities as well as confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include potassium, heparin, Keppra, aspirin.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  Throughout the recording, the patient rapidly transitions between wakefulness and sleep.  During maximal arousal, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic 7-8 Hz theta activity.  PDR is overall unstable and the PDR is poorly formed over the left hemisphere.  The anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient is very weak.  The background primarily consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity.  During sleep, the amount of delta increases and spindle like low amplitude waveforms are observed.  There is paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  No clear electrographic seizures are observed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Moderate focal left hemispheric slowing.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing that is more pronounced over the left hemisphere.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically non-specific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possible structural in etiology, including the post ictal EEG pattern.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
