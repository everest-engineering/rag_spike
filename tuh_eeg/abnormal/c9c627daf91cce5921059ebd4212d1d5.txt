CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed male with a history of complex partial seizures since 2007.  Seizures are characterized by mostly being nocturnal, reaching up toward his head and ruffling his scalp.  In addition, the patient reports about 3 tonic-clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz symmetric alpha rhythm which is reactive to eye opening.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted.  Photic stimulation elicited vigorous driving.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Posterior slow waves of youth are a normal finding.
