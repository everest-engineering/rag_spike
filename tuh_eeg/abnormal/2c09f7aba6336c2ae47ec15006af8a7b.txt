CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old gentleman, admitted on 12th, had an episode of unresponsiveness prior to induction of anesthesia for right hepatectomy.  He had a tonic-clonic seizure on 15th.  Arachnoid cyst.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, piperacillin and tazobactam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a postictal EEG recorded at 11 a.m.  The initial EEG is low voltage diffusely slow at central beta.  The primary frequencies are low-voltage delta with smaller amounts of beta and theta.
As the recording continues, stimulation of the patient produces an alerting response with faster frequency activity.
Over the course of the record, there was an increase in theta in the background.  In addition, the patient seems to be moving a bit or has some very slow eye movements at the end.
Heart rate 140 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to marked background slowing, improving somewhat overtime.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The marked background slowing may be part of this patient's metabolic disorder or due to the use of sedative-hypnotic medications.  No focal or epileptiform features were seen, and there were no specific hallmarks of metabolic encephalopathy.
