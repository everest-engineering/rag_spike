CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old male with headaches, recurrent syncope, peripheral
neuropathy, lifelong schizophrenia, history of perinatal injury.
MEDICATIONS: Seroquel
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG
demonstrates intermittent slowing and disorganization. There are sections of the record
where the background is more organized with brief, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm but much of
the time the alpha is slower at 8.3 Hz with some theta frequency activity mixed in.
Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. Disorganization for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with a history of head trauma and
longstanding schizophrenia, the findings are less prominent than expected. There are
no epileptiform features noted.
