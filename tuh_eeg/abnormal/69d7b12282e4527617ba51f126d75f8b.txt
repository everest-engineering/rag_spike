CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old woman with acute left PCA infarct, right PCA parietal infarct as well who presented with a seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Versed, Ativan, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is somnolent and uncomfortable. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG does demonstrate posteriorly predominant delta, more so in the right posterior region than the left. On the left, there is a glimpse of an alpha rhythm identified. The alpha rhythm is, however, somewhat slow. As the recording continues, the patient is uncomfortable with head shaking from side-to-side obscuring parts of the EEG. As the recording continues, the intrahemispheric asymmetry becomes a bit more prominent particularly as the patient becomes a little drowsy and there is 11 Hz activity noted in the background on the left which is absent on the right and there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm discernible on the left on occasion.
HR: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed focal slowing particularly from the right posterior quadrant.
3. Intermittent slowing from the left posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features in this challenging EEG. The findings described above are compatible with an occipital process involving the gray and white matter as would be seen in the context of acute ischemia.
