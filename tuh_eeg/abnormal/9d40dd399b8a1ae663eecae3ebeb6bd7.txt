CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old prisoner with diabetes, schizophrenia, and blindness.  The patient has a history of right hemiparesis, status post tracheostomy with refractory prolonged seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Keppra, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient's lower extremities only are shackled.  She is awake and answering questions, but is not 100% cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is low-to-medium voltage.  There is an overall theta frequency pattern with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm, but the patient does not particularly even cooperate with the concept of eye opening and eye closure.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in slowing.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If refractory epilepsy is an important consideration, more prolonged EEG recording will be undertaken.
