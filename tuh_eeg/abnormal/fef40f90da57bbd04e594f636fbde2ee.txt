CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed female with recurrent syncope July 18.

MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is omitted, but
photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz, 60 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta
activity. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta. The vertex waves
appear in dreams. Mu activity is noted in wakefulness. Photic stimulation elicits scant
driving.

HR: 60 bpm with very frequent PVCs.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG but abnormal EKG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional cardiac input may be appropriate. In addition,
there is a technical note for this EEG. Electrode placement is in question given the
amplitude pattern of the vertex waves and to meet appropriate technical quality, this
study should be repeated.
