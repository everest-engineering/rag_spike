REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy since childhood, now seizure-free for 21 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation that produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded  stage I and stage II sleep.  Please note that the during stage I transition to stage II and drowsiness there were benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS) seen over the left and right hemisphere.
Heart rate 66.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen at T3 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 HZ and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to occasional left mid  temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.  Please note that BETS were noted during this recording.
