CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old male with a stroke alert the same day versus seizures.  The patient had a fall the same day with a loss of consciousness.  Past medical history significant for seizures, CVA, hypertension and is status post aortic arch surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin, ASA, Clonidine, Metoprolol, Norvasc, Insulin, Protonix, Amiodarone, Diflucan, Heparin, Morphine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a very slow and disorganized background on both sides.  There is excessive slowing on the left side.  There is left-sided focal slowing with the maximum on P3 and PZ with sharply contoured wave on the P3.  The patient appears to go stage 1 sleep.  There was a loss of beta frequency on both sides, more on the left than the right.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Slow disorganized background on both sides, more on the left than right.
Left-sided focal slowing with the maximum on P3 and PZ.
Sharply contoured wave on the P3 and PZ with the sharp waves on P3 and PZ.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Disorganized background and focal slowing on the left side.
Left-sided focal sharp waves at maximum on P3 and PZ with sharply contoured waves on the same side.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were seen in the EEG.  Slow disorganized background, more on the left than the right can contribute to the underlying structural subcortical lesion.  Left-sided sharp waves and sharply contoured slowing on the left hemisphere suggest a focal mechanism for seizure.
