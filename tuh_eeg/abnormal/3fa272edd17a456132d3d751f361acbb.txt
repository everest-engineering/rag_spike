CLINICAL HISTORY: 58 year old male right handed with a 2-year history of epilepsy, last seizure 2 years ago, tonic/clonic activity.  Episode of loss of consciousness 3 weeks ago.  Poor historian.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 60 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If further information is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
