LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 57-year-old with several episodes of near syncope/syncope.  Prior to loss of consciousness, the patient reports shortness of breath and lightheadedness.  He recalls falling down.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for atrial fibrillation, CHF, cardiomyopathy, and Bell's palsy.
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, digoxin, Coreg, losartan, and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, the patient rapidly transitions from wakefulness to sleep.  Normal sleep architecture includes symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and diffuse delta activity.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates an irregular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
Normal posterior dominant rhythm.
No clear epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  Rapid transitions from wakefulness to sleep indicate an excessively drowsy patient.  An irregular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
