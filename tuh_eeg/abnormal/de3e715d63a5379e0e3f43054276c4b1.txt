LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old man who was found down on the floor unresponsive with a finger stick of 25.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Zosyn, vancomycin, sildenafil.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed at patient's bedside.  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1/T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of periods of diffuse voltage attenuation lasting from several seconds to approximately 12-15 seconds, followed by progressive onset of bifrontal slow delta activity that increases in frequency and amplitude and spreads diffusely.  These episodes occur throughout the recording.  When the patient is stimulated diffuse voltage attenuation was achieved.  Due to the recurrent nature of these episodes, I suspect that these represent recurrent seizures.  No abnormal sleep architecture is captured.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.
FINDINGS:  Status epilepticus.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21-minute EEG due to suspected status epilepticus involving bifrontal regions.  However, at least on several occasions, during the recording this discrete EEG pattern could be elicited by stimulation.  Therefore, it is also possible that these episodes represent forms of reactivity.  The findings were communicated to the neurology consult team.
