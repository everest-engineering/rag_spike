REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of losing consciousness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and borderline diabetes, a right MCA stroke in 2011 as well as drug abuse, presents to the hospital after passing out while driving and does not remember the accident.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Tylenol, aspirin, hydralazine and other medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.   The patient was recorded during limited wakefulness and sleep. Activating procedures, included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Heart rate:  60.
The record opens up mainly in sleep and limited wakefulness is captured.  During the limited wakefulness at times posterior dominant rhythm can be seen that reaches 9 Hz but the majority of the time, there is an overall theta during wakefulness.  Otherwise, some normal sleep architecture sleep is stage II and I is seen.
Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges: Excessive theta during limited wakefulness.
Seizures: None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to excessive theta during limited wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
