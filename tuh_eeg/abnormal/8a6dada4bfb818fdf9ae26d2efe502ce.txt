CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old right handed male with left subdural hematoma,
renal failure, seizure on the 29th of March.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Tylenol, Famotidine, isosorbide, Darbepoetin, Keppra,
Tamsulosin, Labetalol, Morphine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is quite slow with rhythmic
theta and delta. Frontal eye movement artifact is noted. Occasional triphasic waves
are noted which are higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. The overall
background is a mixture of theta and delta with shifting asymmetries and some sharply
contoured wave forms. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in faster
frequency activity.
HR: 104 bpm and irregular.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Significant background slowing.
2. Shifting asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is slower than his initial studies and may reflect
a toxic or metabolic pattern. The amplitude asymmetry is an anticipating finding
following the evacuation of subdural hematoma.
