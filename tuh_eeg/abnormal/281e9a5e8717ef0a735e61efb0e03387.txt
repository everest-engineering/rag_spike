CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed man with hypertension who had a fall and was found to have a small hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Benicar.
REASON FOR EEG:  Possible seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  The patient reaches drowsiness.  Activating procedure including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If this is still a concern, further testing with deeper stages of sleep may be helpful in confirming a diagnosis.
