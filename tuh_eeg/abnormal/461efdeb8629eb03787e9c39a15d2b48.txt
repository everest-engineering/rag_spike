CLINICAL HISTORY:  16 year old right handed female with past medical history of pneumonia, complications from ventilator with episode of being scared and looking around without memory.
MEDICATIONS:  Clonidine, Lovenox, Ativan, Melatonin, Morphine, Protonix, Calcium, Iron, Lactobacillus, Sodium Chloride.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Episode of confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in sleep mainly.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background that at best reaches 8-9 Hz, however, the patient mainly and quickly falls asleep in less than a minute.  It is noted that she is in stage 2 sleep.  There are no abnormalities with photic stimulation and no other abnormalities are noted.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.  Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts seen for limited periods of time during wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  Please note that this recording was mainly in sleep and the limited wakefulness that was captured, the patient quickly into drowsiness and it is possible that part of this mild abnormality may be due to short latency of sleep.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  If a sleep disorder is clinically considered, further evaluation by a sleep specialist may be of help.
