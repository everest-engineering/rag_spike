CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old left handed male with oligodendroglioma, now with episodes of arm flexion and eyes rolling up in his head.  VP shunt.  Altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Zonisamide, Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with generous beta.  There are bursts of relatively symmetric theta.  Superimposed on this there is a subtle asymmetry which at times drops out of faster frequency activity on the left.  The record intermittently attenuates and that attenuation may be symmetric.  In the context of a breach rhythm on the left, there are some small discrete left frontotemporal sharp waves.
HR:    144 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A continuous pattern with rhythmic theta followed by brief attenuation.
Generous beta.
An intermittent asymmetry with occasional attenuation on the left.
Occasional to rare lower amplitude discrete left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is most supportive of an anesthetic pattern for this patient on a propofol drip.  The generous beta may represent the medications
utilized and the brief attenuations can be part of the acute brain process or the medications.  Focal and epileptiform features in this record are quite subtle.
