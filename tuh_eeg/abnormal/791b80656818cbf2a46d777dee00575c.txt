CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed gentleman with exacerbation of seizures earlier  this month, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, hepatitis-C. stroke, thrombocytopenia, cervical myelopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. This is a routine outpatient record In an individual who Is somewhat confused. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm on the left. Arrhythmic delta activity is observed in the right temporal region which is, at times, paroxysmal. There is a sharp wave noted in the right mid to posterior temporal region at T6, occasionally T4. There are bursts of sharp waves and bursts of rhythmic slowing. Although testing is not performed during all of these bursts, they do not appear to the technician to be clinically significant. The patient is stimulated for photic stimulation. The posterior sharp waves are observed on the right. There is a driving response elicited, left greater than right, but, again, no clear clinical signs are noted. The patient is assessed afterward and does not appear to have had any change in mental status.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous right mid to posterior temporal focal slowing.
2. Temporal rhythmic delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality in the right temporal region. Although exhaustive testing was not performed during the record, no changes in the patients clinical state were observed with this.
