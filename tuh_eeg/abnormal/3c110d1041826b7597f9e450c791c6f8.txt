CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old, right handed woman, who has more than 12 to 20 years of spells characterized by staring, followed by generalized shaking, loss of consciousness, postictal confusion.  Last event was 3 months ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
As the patient becomes drowsy there is an increase in theta.  Hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing is followed by vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of background slowing.
Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake through stage II sleep record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration a follow up study may be of value.
