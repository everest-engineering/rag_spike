CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a history of generalized tonic-clonic convulsions.  The patient is currently 13 weeks pregnant.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and prenatal vitamins.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation did not result in significant change in the background.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 23-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
