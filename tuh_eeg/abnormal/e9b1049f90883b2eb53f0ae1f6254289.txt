Lovastatin, Omeprazole, Meloxicam, Paxil, Premarin, Keppra,
Levothyroxine, Paroxetine, Endocet, Divalproex
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed. This an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Features of drowsiness
include anterior spread of alpha. Wicket is followed by rhythmic central beta and then
vertex waves and brief spindles. Hyperventilation produces minimal slowing of the
background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
