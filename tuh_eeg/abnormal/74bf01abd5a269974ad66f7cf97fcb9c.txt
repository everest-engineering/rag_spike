CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed male with multiple syncopal episodes, cocaine abuse, atrial fibrillation, and syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol, ASA, Lisinopril, Amiodarone
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and drowsy study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a 9 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness included increasing beta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
HR:    72 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study to capture deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
