CLINICAL HISTORY:  84 year old right handed woman, prior RMCA stroke, left facial droop, recurrent syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, ASA, Insulin, Protonix, Lovenox, Metoprolol, Hydralazine, Lipitor, Isosorbide
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This patient is quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Much of the record includes a drowsy pattern.  With drowsiness there is a pattern of alpha and frequency activity, followed by bursts of paroxysmal delta.  POSTS are observed in stage I sleep. The patient is awakened for photic stimulation and demonstrates an alpha rhythm of 8 Hz.  Scant bilateral driving is noted.
HR:    80 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess drowsiness.
A maximal wakefulness background slowing.
Bursts of paroxysmal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  The FIRDA and background slowing are nonspecific findings which could be due to a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function or a postictal state.  They may also be seen in a metabolic disturbance.  The irregular heart rate may be evaluated by other means.
