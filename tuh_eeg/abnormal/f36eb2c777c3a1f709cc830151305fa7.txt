CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old woman with epilepsy, last seizure in 07/2010.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a youthful
pattern with a high amplitude 10 Hertz alpha rhythm, occasional posterior slow waves of
youth. Drowsiness is characterized by still rolling eye movements with an increasing
beta. Hyperventilation produces a recent amplitude. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR: 64 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
