REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 27-year-old with a left skull defect with a left frontal abscess removed and had seizure activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Heart rate:  66, normal.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves frequently seen at FP2 more than FP1 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to frequent prefrontal right more than left slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the frontal region on the right more than the left, which is consistent with the known injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
