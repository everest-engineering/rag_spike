CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old gentleman who had a tonic clonic seizure at home and was found to have a right thalamic hemorrhage. He has a past history of both seizures and alcohol abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra and others
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a well organized pattern from the left with symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm. Generous beta activity is identified bilaterally. The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent to continuous 0.75 to 2 Hz delta activity seen in the central regions, but with a generous field of spread central temporal frontal central. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm from the left and an increase in beta. There is a bit more theta on the right as the patient becomes drowsy.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic delta from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most compatible with a structural or functional abnormality on the right involving gray and white matter. No epileptiform features were observed.
