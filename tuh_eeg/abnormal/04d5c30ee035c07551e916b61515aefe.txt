CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 32-year-old woman with left occipital headache followed by facial twitching, currently pregnant.  Frequent spells with facial twitching, also back pain, headache, and increasing anxiety disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Morphine, gabapentin, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  The patient was very uncomfortable prior to the EEG and was experiencing one of her headaches.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with slow-rolling eye movements and central theta.  Stage II sleep was not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting in and out of sleep and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The generous beta described above may represent this patient's medication effect or anxiety.  This is the third EEG for this patient without epileptiform activity.
