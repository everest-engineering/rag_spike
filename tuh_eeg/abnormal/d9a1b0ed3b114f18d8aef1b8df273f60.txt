CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed female with a history of brain cancer in 1996 with resection and radiotherapy with right centrotemporal craniotomy and resection and baseline left sided weakness who presents with chief complaints of neck pain and change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Insulin and Protonix.
REASON FOR EEG:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Activating procedures were not performed. Wakefulness and drowsiness was seen.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm and 9 hertz with an amplitude of 22 to 60 microvolts which is reactive eye opening and seemed better over the right hemisphere. Frontocentral beta is seen and there is also a symmetry with increased amplitude over the right hemisphere. Wave forms in drowsiness are seen. No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Focal slow waves seen continuously at T4, C4 at a frequency of 2-4 hertz and amplitude of 20 to 75 microvolts. An associated breech rhythm is seen in this region.
SEIZURES:: None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right central temporal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the right central temporal region, which is consistent with the known history of tumor and surgical resection. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
