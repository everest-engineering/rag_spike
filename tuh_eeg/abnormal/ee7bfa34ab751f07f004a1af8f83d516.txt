REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old woman status post fall, having seizures with acute on chronic subdural with rightward shifts and resection on the left.  Has a past medical history of seizures, COPD, hypertension, bipolar, DVT, pulmonary edema, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and fibromyalgia.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Benadryl, Advair, famotidine.  Patient has Lamictal and valproic acid.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  Patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Overall, there is slight prominence of focal slowing over the left hemisphere compared to the right and loss of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  There appears to be some variability and mild reactivity to this EEG.  Patient performed photic stimulation with no abnormal discharges seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slowing at T3 seen continuously with loss of faster frequencies.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen continuously.
HEART RATE:  108.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left midtemporal focal slowing with loss of faster frequencies as well as generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left midtemporal region and the loss of faster frequencies consistent with the known left subdural hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
