CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 68-year-old woman who presents after a single episode of passing out.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation with photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Fast alpha variant is frequently present.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No sleep is captured.
Hyperventilation produces mild symmetrical diffuse slowing.
Photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
An irregular heart rate is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured.  However, stage II sleep was not recorded. If clinical indication for epilepsy still persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
