CLINICAL HISTORY:  43 year old right handed female with a history of seizures, asthma, and drug abuse, presents with decreased mental status when she fell down stairs 2 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, Valium, Dilantin, Albuterol, Prilosec.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is marked muscle movement artifact throughout the recording as the patient would not lie still.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm and no normal frontocentral beta.  The patient does not exhibit any normal sleep architecture.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There are generalized slow waves seen in a, at times, pseudoperiodic pattern that is between 2 to 3 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts, which is seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves, at times with a pseudoperiodic pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology; however, this pseudoperiodic pattern can be seen with neurodegenerative diseases.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
