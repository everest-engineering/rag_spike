CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed male with diabetes, psoriasis, acute
and chronic subdural hematoma following alcohol ingestion.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. This an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern rich
with beta frequency activity and a smaller amount of theta frequency activity. There is a
bit of rhythmic theta delta, more so on the left than the right, and accentuated by
hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation
elicits a driving response. Towards the close of the record, the patient drifts into stage
2 sleep and a little bit of left posterior slowing is noted.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent excess beta.
2. Small amount of excess theta.
3. Shifting slowing a bit more so in the left posterior quadrant.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow up study may be useful.
