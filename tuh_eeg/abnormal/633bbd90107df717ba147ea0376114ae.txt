LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  29 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 28-year-old man with an episode of seizure versus syncope.  The patient felt like an anxiety attack.  He took a deep breath and lost consciousness.  Apparently there was twitching in both hands, eyes, and face, lasting less than a minute.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for anxiety and asthma.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Prevacid.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and there is an increased amount of theta.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in mild diffuse symmetrical background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 29 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical diagnosis of the seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
A lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
