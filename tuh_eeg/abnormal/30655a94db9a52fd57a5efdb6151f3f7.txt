CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male with palpitations, evaluate for TIA.
MEDICATIONS: Motrin, ASA, Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an alpha 11-Hz posterior dominant rhythm and generous beta activity noted in the background. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta with beta followed by vertex waves and K complexes. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
