REASON FOR STUDY:  Myoclonic jerks.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old woman with pain and numbness in all extremities and left-sided jerks.  History of myoclonic jerks.  History of cervical radiculopathy.  Here for EEG to rule out pseudoseizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and temazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness only.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.  There was some diffuse movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures include photic stimulation.  During the entire recording, the patient complained of pain in her shoulders and hands and was irregularly breathing and appeared uncomfortable.  At times she would shake her right arm and make mouth movements but was responsive throughout the entire recording.  During the entire episode the EEG remained unchanged and normal.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that during the entire recording the patient continued this same behavior as described above and there were no EEG changes during the behavior despite some shaking.
