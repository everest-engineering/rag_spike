CLINICAL HISTORY:  20 year old left handed male with migraine headaches characterized by headache with loss of consciousness and shaking, followed by confusion.

MEDICATIONS:  Fioricet

INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient appears to be somewhat tremulous.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  When awake and alert, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.

HR:    90 bpm

IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up sleep-deprived EEG may be helpful.
