CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old right handed man with seizures status post gunshot wound to the head in 2009.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures with hyperventilation and photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.  There is stage 1 sleep noted during the recording.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently almost continuously at F7/T3 with an associated breach rhythm in that region.  There is 1 sharp transient noted during the recording, but not clearly epileptiform.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known gunshot wound.  No seizures were seen.  Please note that this EEG is slightly the same compared to the one performed on May 8, 2009, with the slight difference that there is no generalized slowing and also better or improved in comparison to the one performed May 11, 2009, where there were some bilateral anterior temporal and midtemporal sharp waves seen.
