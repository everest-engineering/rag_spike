CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old right handed woman with left carotid endarterectomy in October, now with right sided tremor, history of lupus, heart failure, and CAD.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Celexa, Plavix, Simvastatin, Citalopram, Clopidogrel,
Lisinopril, isosorbide, Levothyroxine. Metoprolol, Remeron
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a low voltage, 9 Hz
alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. Drowsiness is
characterized by an increase in beta. Muscle twitch artifact is noted throughout the
EEG. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate: 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. The
patient's focal twitching may account for the muscle twitch artifact noted prominently in
the frontalis regions. This is the patient's third normal EEG
