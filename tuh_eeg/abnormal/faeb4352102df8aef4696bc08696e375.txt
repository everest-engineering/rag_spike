CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed woman with 2 seizures on November 2010 and January 2011, both around the holidays. She was found to have had nocturnal seizures with lip smacking, automatisms, tongue biting. Family history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, HCTZ, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 to 60 microvolts. Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record, photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If needed, a followup study capturing a deeper stage of sleep may be considered.
