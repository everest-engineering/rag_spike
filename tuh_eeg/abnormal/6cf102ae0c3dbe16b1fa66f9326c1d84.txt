CLINICAL HISTORY:  71 year old woman with recurrent syncopal spells with a dazed look, hypertension, diabetes,  obesity, obstructive sleep apnea.

MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Heparin, Nifedipine, Lisinopril, Insulin, Protonix, ASA


INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation is completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is mildly slow with a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 7.5 Hz. The patient is quite drowsy and rapidly drifts off into a drowsy pattern over steeper stages of sleep. Photic stimulation elicits an unilateral driving response, better elicited on the left compared to the right. In addition, the photic stimulation serves to alert the patient, at which point the left hemisphere seems to generate faster frequency better than the right.

HR:	58 bpm


IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Generalized background slowing and disorganization.
2. 	Disruption of faster frequency activity on the right supporting a cortical process.


CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The patient's hypersomnolence is more of a clinical issue. There are no epileptiform features noted. The focal features described above may be correlated with imaging.
