CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old male with episodes of blacking out and visual blurring.  The patient states that he was walking and has a sudden feeling out of the ordinary and then visual obscurations.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall EEG is low voltage with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Eye flutter is noted in the background.  Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with rhythmic central theta, slow rolling eye movements, and an increase in beta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal electroencephalogram in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta described above is a nonspecific finding which can be seen in the context of anxiety, normal variant, or the use of a benzodiazepine medication.  The low voltage pattern described above is also a normal adult pattern.
