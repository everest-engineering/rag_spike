CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old male admitted September 3, with hypoxic respiratory failure, found down with right MCA infarct, persistent obtundation, now weaning off the ventilator.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, Vancomycin, Albumin, Valproate, Pantoprazole, Zosyn
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient was intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency background, but with generalized slowing and a mixture of delta and theta.  There are some shifting asymmetries, but the overall pattern is relatively symmetric.  When the patient is reactive, there is eye movement and a bit more faster frequency activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in delta.  There are rare sections of the record with a bit more focal slowing with attenuation of faster frequency in the right frontocentral region.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Rare sections of the record with more well-defined focal slowing characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This study is very similar to the previous study September 4th .  The overall pattern is more compatible with a diffuse cerebral insult as might be anticipated with hypoxic anoxic injury.  If additional information is needed, somatosensory evoked potentials may be valuable for a prognosis.
