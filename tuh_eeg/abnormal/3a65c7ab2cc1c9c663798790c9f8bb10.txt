CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right handed male, status post resection for glioma, past history of aphasia and hematoma.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Levetiracetam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This an awake and sleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. A breech rhythm can be identified from the left frontal region and there is a subtle area of focal slowing with some rhythmic 3-4Hz activity in that region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta. The breech rhythm is a bit more prominent in drowsiness, as is some of the rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving bilaterally. Again, the breech rhythm is a bit more prominent. At the close of the record the patient starts to drift off into stage 2 sleep. The field of the left frontal focal slowing actually increases a bit more posteriorly in sleep.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing primarily in the left frontal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG nor the one 6 months ago. The focal slowing and breech rhythm are anticipated findings after craniotomy.
