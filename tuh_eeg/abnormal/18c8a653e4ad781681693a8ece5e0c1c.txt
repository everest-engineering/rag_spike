CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed woman with a history of subdural
hematoma, stroke and seizure in 2007.
MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, Quinapril, Procardia, Metformin, Lantus, Lovastatin,
Hydrochlorothiazide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta
activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Scant shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Previous EEGs from 2007, were abnormal. An EEG in
2008 was normal and the small degree of shifting slowing here is quite modest. No
epileptiform activity has been seen in the last 2 EEGs.
