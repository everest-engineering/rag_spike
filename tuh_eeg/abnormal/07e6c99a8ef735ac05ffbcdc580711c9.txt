CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old woman with HIV disease, left sided weakness, trauma right visual field cut, neck pain, status post a fall down the stairs and shaking spell. Renal failure, multiple septic emboli.
MEDICATIONS: Zocor, Norvasc, Metoprolol, Cefepime, Zidovudine, Amlodipine, Plavix, Protonix, Ampicillin, Cefepime, Efavirenz.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is very uncomfortable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is disorganized and diffusely slow, lacking in some of the typical morphologies for an awake adult. There is a 4.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm best identified from the left compared to the right. Bursts of bilaterally posteriorly predominant sharp activity is noted, maximum on the left and right posterior regions. The left is a bit more O1 and the right is a bit more T6. In addition, there are independent sharp waves identified in the right central temporal region. As the patient becomes a little drowsy, the background is a bit more rhythmic and there is a 4.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm which demonstrates shifting asymmetry. There are also some left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves noted. Features of drowsiness include the appearance of vertex sharp waves. As the patient becomes drowsy, however, there are also some left posterior temporal parietal occipital sharp waves which are small and discrete.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: 1. Marked abnormal background. 2. Arrhythmic delta activity. 3. Sharp waves noted from both hemispheres particularly the left posterior quadrant and right central temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The sharp waves on the left correlate with the patient's abscesses. The sharp waves from the right may be a little bit more challenging to correlate with this patient's structural abnormality.
