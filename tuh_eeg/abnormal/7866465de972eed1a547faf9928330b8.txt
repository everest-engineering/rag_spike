CLINICAL HISTORY: 	69 year old right handed male, admitted with psychosis and a staring spell.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Insulin, Heparin, Morphine, Clozaril, Metformin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed  at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is intubated and poorly interactive but arouses spontaneously.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG varies from a lower voltage theta delta pattern to one with generous amounts of beta.  Shifting slowing in the temporal regions is identified.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, vertex waves and an increasing beta are noted.  Single electrode artifact is picked up at T2.
HR:   66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.  Generalized background  slowing
2.  Disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are nonspecific and support a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.  No epileptiform features were noted.   If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study after the patient is out of the ICU may be considered.
