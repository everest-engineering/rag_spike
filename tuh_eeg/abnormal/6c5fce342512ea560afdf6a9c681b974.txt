CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 83-year-old woman found down at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday, July 28.  She was shivering with eyes rolling straight ahead, had not been incontinent.  Evaluate for seizure or change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is restless or drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat slow with a theta pattern as well as generous beta.  Shifting arrhythmic delta is noted, but there is a bit more delta in the right hemisphere particularly centrotemporal and posterior temporal regions.  Arousals are characterized by an increase in beta.  When awake, the patient seems to be quite confused.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse background slowing.
Shifting arrhythmic delta.
Superimposed focal slowing from the right hemisphere, particularly the centrotemporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The generalized background slowing and focal slowing may be correlated with imaging and clinical history.
