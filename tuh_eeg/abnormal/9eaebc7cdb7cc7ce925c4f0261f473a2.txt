CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male with intractable epilepsy with vagal nerve stimulator and behavioral problems.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Trileptal, Depakote
INTRODUCTION   Digital EEG  was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is drowsy
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. There is a great deal of EKG artifact picked up throughout the record . There are bursts of frontal delta and there are also some bursts of sharply contoured right occipital rhythmic delta noted. That delta is approximately 3Hz. Because of the degree of muscle and movement artifact this is a very challenging EEG and epileptiform activity, particularly i1the central and temporal regions. particularly on the right, may have been overlooked. There is a suggestion of some frontal sharp activity more so on the left than the right but again there is significant difficulty in terms d artifact. As the patient drifts off to sleep there are sharply contoured frontal waves noted and the suggestion of an underlying sharp wave in the right hemisphere, which may start frontotemporally  and then migrate posteriorly. Additional areas of concern are also obscured by the EKG artifact,which is substantial in this record The patient is drowsy throughout much of the record.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing
2. Likely epileptiform activity in the right occipital and frontal regions
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded. Comparison With previous studies is suggested.  Previous EEGs have demonstrated a left frontal spike focus and sharp waves from the right.  These waves forms are likely present today,but obscured by EEG artifact.
