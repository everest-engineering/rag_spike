CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old woman with a left meningioma resection, postoperative day 3
with declining mental status. She has significant frontal lobe changes and baseline
encephalomalacia with subdural hemorrhage and confluent intraparenchymal hematomas and
hydrocephalus.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Mannitol, Zofran, Decadron, Pantoprazole, Vancomycin, Cefepime,
Lovenox, Zofran, Dexamethasone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. The overall
background is a mixture of irregular theta and delta. There are posteriorly predominant sharp
waves, includes P5, and independently T6 02. There are bursts of faster frequency activity
which are picked up at the midline. The activity from the left frontal region is more or less
suppressed and there is more arrhythmic delta activity noted on the right. Tactile stimulation of
the patient seems to elicit a run of epileptiform activity. The epileptiform activity from the right
and left do not seem to be connected, but tactile stimulation seems to have produced
asynchronous train of sharp waves and spikes from either hemisphere, each of which have its
own periodicity. Additional spontaneous bursts of this epileptiform activity are noted. Again,
right occipital temporal and left occipital, again, without clear linkage between the 2 bursts.
96bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relative suppression of activity from the frontal regions.
2. Occipitally temporal predominant epileptiform activity.
3. Marked background slowing and disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic process. The
epileptiform activity is generous posteriorly, not anteriorly. These findings may be
correlated with this patient's clinical exam and history. The possibility of subclinical seizures
should be considered in this individual.
