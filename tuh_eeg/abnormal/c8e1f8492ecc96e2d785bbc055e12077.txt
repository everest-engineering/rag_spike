CLINICAL HISTORY:  39 year old right handed woman, with memory loss for the last 10 years, now worsening.  The patient forgets how to do things on a daily basis.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Hyperventilation produces rhythmic slowing of the background with brief bursts of theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal nor epileptiform features are identified.  The vigorous driving is a normal finding.
