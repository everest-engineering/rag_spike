CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old woman with epilepsy, past history of traumatic brain injury status post fall, seizure, loss of consciousness and hepatic laceration.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tegretol, Motrin, Morphine, Reglan,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a bedside study in an awake patient. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there are portions where the background EEG is well-organized with a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm but this is disrupted by rhythmic, high amplitude frontal delta. Shifting asymmetries are observed in the frontal regions. The rhythmic frontal slowing is variable at some points, a little more arrhythmic on the right or the left and there are 1 or 2 suspicious left frontotemporal sharp waves observed. Features of drowsiness include an increase in the frontal rhythmic delta activity. In addition, is rhythmic background slowing.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:1. Rhythmic background slowing.
