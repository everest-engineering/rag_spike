CLINICAL HISTORY:  31 year old right handed female with occasional cramps in the hands alleviated by Lamictal with a single outside EEG that was described as abnormal.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity.  The patient is very sleepy and spends much of the record in stage 2 sleep with vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS. Hyperventilation does not specifically activate the record. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off into stage 2 sleep.  On 1-2 occasions the patient seems to about to drift into slow wave sleep.
HR: 	72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed in this EEG.   The excessive sleepiness is to be anticipated in that it was a sleep deprived record.
