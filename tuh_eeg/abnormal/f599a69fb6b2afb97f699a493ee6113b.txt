CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed female, presents with acute left arm
weakness and numbness for the past 4 days. Past medical history significant for sleep
apnea, epilepsy and status post resection of meningioma in 2003. T e patient has a
skull defect in the left temporal area

MEDICATIONS: Depakote.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrated a 10 hertz
alpha pattern. There was increased beta in drowsiness. Hyperventilation accentuated
focal slowing. There was temporal beta with hyperventilation.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal slowing in
2. Frontotemporal sharp waves were seen in photic stimulation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Left temporal slowing maybe related to structural
abnormality or medication. Hyperventilation did bring out frontotemporal sharp waves. EEG does support a diagnosis of epilepsy.
