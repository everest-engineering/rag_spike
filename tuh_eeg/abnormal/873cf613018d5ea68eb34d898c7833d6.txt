LENGTH OF RECORDING:  Approximately 25 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old man with history of presumed generalized epilepsy.  The patient continues to have seizures despite being on Depakote, so recently Topamax was added.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Topamax, albuterol, Advair, singular.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with a single channel EKG, as well as additional T1 and T2 electrode.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 Hz to 11 Hz activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies in lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During drowsiness alpha attenuates and there is an increase in diffuse beta activity.  Stage of sleep is not captured.
Hyperventilation produces no change in the background.
Photic stimulation induces symmetrical occipital driving in mid to high range frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy, approximately 25 minute, EEG. No epileptiform discharges are captured.  However, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical diagnosis of epilepsy persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
When compared to the EEG from December 1, 2011 there has been no discernable change.
