CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old woman with refractory epilepsy following herpes
encephalitis, recent miscarriage now 5 weeks pregnant with increasingly aggressive seizures,
status post phenobarbital cessation.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal, Phenobarb, Zonegran
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. The family reports that the patient had a seizure earlier this morning.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is awake and cooperative. The overall
background is slow, disorganized with primarily a theta frequency background. Lambda is noted
in the background. Independent bursts of high amplitude, sharp waves of approximately 160
microseconds and greater than 100 millivolts are identified in brief bursts typically lasting less
than 10 seconds from the right or left temporal region. The sharp waves also occur individually
and there are some sharply contoured slowing. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
beta activity. The epileptiform activity has a more extensive field of spread into the anterior
temporal regions in drowsiness and even into T6/02 as the patient becomes sleepy. This
phenomenon is also seen on the left with more and more of a mid to posterior temporal
localization as the patient drifts off to sleep. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. It
increases the epileptiform activity which is, however, quite prominent during photic stimulation.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Prominent epileptiform activity from the right or left temporal region which is independent
and may be mid or posterior temporal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a highly epileptogenic focus. No seizures were
recorded. These findings are similar to previous studies.
