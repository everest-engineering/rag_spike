CLINICAL HISTORY:  A right handed, 29-year-old male, with tonic clonic seizures which began at age 19, previously refractory now with 1-2 seizures per month.  The patient goes to the emergency room for each seizure.  Seizures are preceded by a severe headache.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake through stage II sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS are seen in sleep.  Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Supraharmonic driving was observed which is a normal phenomenon.  If seizures are an important consideration, either review of the patient's previous EEGs or a sleep deprived EEG may be considered, although this patient was very sleepy.
