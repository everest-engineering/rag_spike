CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 21-year-old male with mental retardation, seizure free since 2008.  Seizures are characterized by staring spells and foaming at the mouth with spasticity in the right arm.  This is a followup EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Risperdal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This was an awake EEG recorded in a wheelchair for a patient who had problems with head control.
TECHNICAL:  There was a great deal of muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the EEG demonstrates a low-voltage feature of pattern with scant beta.  The normal morphologies of wakefulness including a posterior dominant rhythm were not seen.  The patient was moving almost continuously throughout the EEG.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Frequent eye movement artifact was noted.
HEART RATE:  108 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging but abnormal EEG due to:
Paucity of normal wave forms expected for an adult of this age.
Low-voltage featureless pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second EEG for this adult without epileptiform activity.  In a seizure free individual, consideration for medication reduction may be of value.
