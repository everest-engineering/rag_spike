CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old woman with a history of bipolar disease and acute
decline in cognition.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside
using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with o1 channel of EKG. The
patient Is relatively cooperative with the LTM. She has intermittent episodes of poor
responsiveness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow
background with at best a 8 Hz alpha rhythm typically slower, such as 6 at Hz, and
excess stated. There is some asymmetric eye blink artifact. There is actually relatively
little sleep for this individual, who spends the entire time in bed, or nearly the entire time
In bed. The patient is tested on multiple occasions when she is lying motionless in bed.
She is awake during all occasions with a somewhat slow background. There is some
artifacts and some suboptimal electrode placement, but there are no epileptiform
features. Towards the end of the record, after the patient spent a bit more time in the
unit, she starts to sit up, get up and out of bed and out of bed to the bathroom. In
addition, by 14:04 she is able to talk on the phone.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due To:
1. Moderate background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's medications or supravascular disease mayâ•–
play a roll in the background described above. There are no epileptiform features. The
episodes of hand shaking and unresponsiveness were not associated with EEG
changes.
