CLINICAL HISTORY:  18 year old right handed 18-weeks' pregnant with first-ever seizures, family history of epilepsy, aneurysm and eclampsia.
MEDICATIONS:  Pre-Natal Vit.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, this patient is in stage 1 sleep with vertex waves.  She transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep to wakefulness.  The patient rapidly transitions in and out of stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  She is falling asleep during photic stimulation.
There is a single paroxysmal burst noted in that transition which is generalized, but is suspicious for a discharge on the left.  As she is falling asleep during photic stimulation, there are a handful of bursts with isolated paroxysmal 5 Hz activity, but not definitive spike and wave activity.  The individual appears to be excessively sleepy.  Limited wakefulness is achieved.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
2 subtle bursts of 5 Hz activity not exactly during photic stimulation, but around the time of photic stimulation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG did not adequately identify epileptiform activity.  There are, of course, constraints in the evaluation of a pregnant patient.  The features
described above are suspicious for a inherited mechanism for epilepsy, but are not definitive.  A follow-up study may be helpful to search for epileptiform activity.
