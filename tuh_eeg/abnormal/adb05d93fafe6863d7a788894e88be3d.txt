CLINICAL HISTORY: 87 year old woman with subdural hematoma, postoperative day
#13, evaluate for change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal.
There is intrahemispheric asymmetry. There is some 7 Hz activity seen intermittently from the left, but the right hemisphere demonstrates significant slower activity. Despite wicket activity, there is a left temporal sharp wave with after going slowing activity. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An asymmetry with slower activity on the right compared to the left.
2. Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous study. There is slowing from both hemisphere, more significant on the right. The sharp waves are in the contralateral hemisphere. No seizures were recorded.
