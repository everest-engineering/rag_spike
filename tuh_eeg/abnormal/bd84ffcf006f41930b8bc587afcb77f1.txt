CLINICAL HISTORY:  32 year old man with a history of TBI in 1998, admitted after having an episode of tonic-clonic seizure, brought to the emergency department where he had another seizure and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Pantoprazole, Depakote
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient's impedances were inappropriate, specifically in the occipital electrodes which caused some multi-electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that appears to reach 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient had some normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures did not produce any abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage I/stage II.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
One single sharp transient maximal at F3 seen in the recording while drowsy.
Occasional small amplitude sharp spikes seen at T3, only in stage I sleep, although not seen over T2.  The morphology is most consistent with benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal limited EEG with one suspicious left frontal sharp transient and BETS.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The significance of the left frontal sharp transient is unclear.  A repeated recording should be performed.  Particularly in this patient where the impedances and the quality of the recording was poor, it should be repeated free of charge.  The BETS are benign and do not indicate a high correlation with an epileptogenic focus in that region.
