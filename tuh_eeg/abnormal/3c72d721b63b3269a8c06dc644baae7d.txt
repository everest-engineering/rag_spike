REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures and history of sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroparesis, and stroke, admitted for seizures on April 12, 2013, readmitted on April 17, 2013, now for followup seizures, now increased to one every 2 to 3 days.  Last seizure on June 15, 2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, citalopram, Plavix, Tylenol, lisinopril, Norvasc, Mepron, Imuran, prednisone, milk of magnesia, Lipitor, Dilaudid, Flexeril, NovoLog, aspirin, atenolol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, which produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 and at times at F8/T4, occasionally a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
Heart rate:  80.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
