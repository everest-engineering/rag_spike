CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed female with periodic hypokalemic paralysis. In addition, the patient has episodes where her eyes bounce all over her head and then freeze. Last episode 1 day prior to this.
MEDICATIONS: Kadar (?), Acetazolamide, Synthroid, Neurontin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background and a small amount of slowing. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful.
