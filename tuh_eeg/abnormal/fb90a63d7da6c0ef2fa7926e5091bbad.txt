CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed female with complex partial epilepsy.
The patient provides a history which differs from her primary care physician. She reports
that she fell on the ice 1/25/2011, and had knee pain. An observer described her as
briefly not responsive.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is very low
voltage with a 1 0 Hz alpha rhythm and small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta
activity. Brief stage I sleep is seen with low voltage vertex waves. Hyperventilation is
performed with good effort and produces some rhythmic slowing as well as head
rocking artifact. Photic stimulation is obscured by muscle artifact as is much of the EEG.
HR: 60 bpm slightly irregular with questionable ST segment depression in a single
channel electrocardiogram.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features identified. Because of
the abnormal EKG morphology, copies of the single channel EKG lead will be provided
