CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed gentleman admitted with obtundation
after multiple, repetitive, prolong seizures. Low phenobarbital level.
MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Keppra,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively
somnolent.
DESCRIPTION-OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow, mixed
frequency pattern. It is a dynamic pattern with sections with a more of a lower voltage
delta pattern and others with more beta and theta. Superimposed upon this is some
focal slowing in the right hemisphere particularly the temporal region with arrhythmic
delta activity and a poorly defined T6/02 sharp waves. Stimulation of the patient
produces an increase in alpha and theta frequency activity. There are a handful of
sharp waves noted also at T2-T 4. Photic stimulation does not activate the record, but it
does serve to alert the patient.
HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Right focal slow.
3. Right posterotemporal as well as midtemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous EEGs. This EEG
supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter.
In addition, the focal features and the localizing features for this patient's epilepsy are
unchanged.
