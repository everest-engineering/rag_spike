CLINICAL HISTORY:  Post partum, 27 year old female, who delivered at 26 weeks gestation on April 4, 2012 with eclampsia, positive family history of nieces and nephews with epilepsy.  MRI demonstrates posterior abnormalities.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, Labetalol, Heparin, Motrin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow.  The alpha reaches 7.5 Hz. Features of drowsiness includes rhythmic background slowing with vertex waves, POSTS, as well as a handful of spindles in stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Abnormalities in this EEG include slowing of the alpha rhythm.  In addition, there are a handful of sharp waves, typically at T1, but with some at T3 noted in relaxed wakefulness and accentuated in hyperventilation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The slow alpha rhythm is a nonspecific finding, it can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function, as well as in a disorder of a process
involving the thalamic and occipital pathways.  The left temporal sharp waves raise a concern for a focal mechanism for seizures.
