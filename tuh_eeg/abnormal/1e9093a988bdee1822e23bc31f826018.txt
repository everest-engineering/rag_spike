CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed gentleman with post traumatic epilepsy since 1995, 1-2 seizures a month lasting 5-10 minutes with shaking.
MEDICATIONS: Buspar, Depakote.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is a 9 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm with intermittent background theta. Hyperventilation and drowsiness both accentuate rhythmic focal slowing from the right intertemporal region with right intertemporal sharp waves. Posts are seen in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation produces minimal driving.
HR: 66 bpm with frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. Right temporal focal slowing accentuated by drowsiness and hyperventilation.
3. Right anterior temporal sharp waves and spikes in the context of an underlying breech rhythm.
CLINICAL COURSE: These findings are similar to a previous study and support a focal mechanism for the patient's epilepsy.
