CLINICAL HISTORY:  33 year old right handed male, former boxer with epilepsy  since February 2011 with seizures with aura of strange feeling followed by generalized tonic-clonic and postictal drowsiness.  Poor memory.  Monthly seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 9 Hz, 30 microvolt alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, then attenuation of the alpha rhythm followed by POSTs and vertex and waves.  Hyperventilation does not significantly active the record.  Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.  There are K complexes noted, some of which have anterior spread, but no frontal sharp waves.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in the record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this individual with monthly
seizures, additional monitoring and/or the use of special electrodes may be helpful to characterize his epilepsy.
