CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old male with squamous cell carcinoma, stage IV, status post whole brain irradiation for CNS metastasis now with agitation and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Dexamethasone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is quite dull appearing. The EEG waxes between a lethargic state with occasional arousals.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixture of rhythmic theta and delta. With arousals, there is faster beta frequency activity and some alpha frequency activity. On rare occasions, there is a suggestion of a alpha rhythm.
There are a handful of triphasic waves and poorly formed occasional periodic complexes noted in either hemisphere in the frontocentral regions.
HR: 112 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing.
3. Occasional triphasic waves.
4. Occasional poorly formed periodic complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance o cerebral function effecting both hemispheres. No seizures were recorded and there were no prominent epileptiform features.
