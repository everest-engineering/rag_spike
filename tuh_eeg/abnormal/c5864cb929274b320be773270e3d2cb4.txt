CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed woman, with episodes of confusion, memory loss, going shopping and then trying to call her doctor, amnestic for event.  Seizure versus syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Seizure medication, name unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background is well organized.  There is a 10 Hz, 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm.  Prominent temporal wickets is identified. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta and slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation is performed early in the record and produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Very brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.  Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The vigorous driving response. the wicket, and the generous beta are all normal variants.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow up study may be performed with more extensive sleep.
