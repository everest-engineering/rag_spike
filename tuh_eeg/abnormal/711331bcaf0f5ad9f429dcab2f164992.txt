CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 74-year-old male, status post severe head trauma, patient discharged to a nursing home and then re-admitted on 11/11/2012.  Evaluate for impaired mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Amantadine, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a pattern of low voltage data, intermittently interrupted by rhythmic 1 to 2 Hz delta activity.  In addition, there is some shifting arrhythmic delta activity, a little bit more prominent on the right.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in delta.
Heart rate 114 bmp.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
A patient suffering with traumatic brain injury who does demonstrate some alerting but with minimal alerting, a low alpha rhythm.
Bursts of delta.
Mild shifting and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with both a neurodegenerative process with dementia, such as Parkinson's disease and severe traumatic brain injury.  This EEG demonstrates a slow background.  There was a section where the patient seemed to be awake with tremor and there was an emergence of an alpha rhythm but the patient did not seem to be very interactive at that time.  Clinical management may be the most important tool to follow his mental status.  No epileptiform features were seen.
