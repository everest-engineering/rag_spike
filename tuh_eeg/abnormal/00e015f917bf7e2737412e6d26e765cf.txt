CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, arthritis, osteopenia, and a recent fainting spell associated with a low hemoglobin.
MEDICATIONS: Oxcarbazepine, HCTZ, ASA, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a well defined, 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm. There is subtle theta in the right temporal region and a handful of bursts of sharply contoured slowing and right mid to posterior temporal sharp waves. Features of drowsiness include accentuation of the focal slowing in the right temporal region. As she becomes sleepier vertex waves are observed in stage 1 sleep. She transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Right mid temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to the April 2009 and the October 2009 EEGs. They support a focal mechanism for epilepsy.
