CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 76-year-old woman who presents with a history of loss of consciousness occurred 1 month ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard International 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness and drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9.5 to 10 Hz in frequency, seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There are intermittent bursts of right temporal slowing, maximum at F8/T4 with a frequency of 1.5 to 2 Hz, lasting 1-2 seconds.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not result in a driving response.  Heart rate is 60 beats per minutes.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to right temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The right temporal slowing could be suggestive of an underlying structural abnormality in the right hemisphere or right temporal dysfunction.  No epileptiform abnormalities are identified in this record.  No seizures were captured.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
