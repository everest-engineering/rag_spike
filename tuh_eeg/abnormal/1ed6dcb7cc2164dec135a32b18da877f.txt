CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed male with gout and cavernous hemangioma, large left parietal hemorrhage with edema.  The patient was admitted on the 4th with an episode of numbness which started in the right buttock, radiating up and down the body.  He was unresponsive afterwards.
MEDICATIONS:  Flomax, Diovan, Tegretol, Ativan, Lovastatin, Allopurinol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a primarily drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive alpha rhythm.  Stage 2 sleep includes POSTs, vertex waves, K complexes and spindles.  In the transition to sleep, at times there is a slight asymmetry in the beta.  There is a little bit more beta in the frontocentral region and a little less in the left temporal than the right.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:   EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no focal nor epileptiform features identified in this EEG.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
