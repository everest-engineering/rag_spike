CLINICAL HISTORY:  32 year old right handed male with increasing tonic clonic or complex partial seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Banzel, Potassium, Norvasc, Vimpat, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  The patient is awake,
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal and opens almost with an ictal pattern with rhythmic high amplitude 3 hertz activity in the right posterior quadrant occipital temporal with generous field of spread. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmic delta activity and in fact, seems to generate a seizure during hyperventilation although no clinical symptoms are reported in this non-English speaking adult. The tech does ask the patient, "how are you feeling" and he reports that he "feels okay during the discharge."  The remainder of the EEG demonstrates a slow disorganized pattern with rhythmic theta and delta activity with nearly continuous rhythmic sharply contoured activity in the right hemisphere particularly posterior quadrant, mid to posterior temporal. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response.
HR:    120 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Seizure from the right hemisphere particularly mid to posterior temporal region with waxing and waning epileptiform activity.
Sharp waves from the right hemisphere including occipital or posterior temporal.
Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many patterns for this individual. It is a much more focal pattern than his recent studies have demonstrated.
