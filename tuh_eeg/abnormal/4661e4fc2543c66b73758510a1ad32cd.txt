CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old woman with blackout spells occurring 2 to 3 times a
week. They are associated with head numbness, a funny, cold feeling running down
her back. Past history of childhood epilepsy and depression.

MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Alprazolam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm in a
background of generous beta and a scant amount of theta. Hyperventilation does not
activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Generous beta is a nonspecific finding but can be seen in
the context of anxiety or benzodiazepines. If this patient's spells are frequent, either a
repeat EEG capturing one of her events or an additional long-term EEG monitoring session may be valuable.
