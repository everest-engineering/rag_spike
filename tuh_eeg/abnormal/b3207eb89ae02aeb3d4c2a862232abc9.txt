CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 18-year-old with epilepsy since age 2, now with seizures every 3 weeks, prior to menstruation.  The patient feels hot, has a headache, screams, stares, makes a noise in her throat, and then is confused for 1 to 2 minutes.  History of ADHD.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, clonidine, Zyrtec, and Concerta.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Unfortunately, this patient was not able to get to sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were identified.  Hyperventilation produced some muscle artifact and the patient was noted to be giggling during hyperventilation.  Photic stimulation did not elicit a driving response.  Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in the record.  In this young adult with relatively frequent seizures, a repeat recording closer to the time of her catamenial epilepsy might be valuable.
