CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old woman with a seizure September 2009,
hypertension, diabetes hypercholesterolemia and ataxia.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, ASA, Insulin, Metformin, Levetiracetam, HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation are performed.
This is a 1 hour sleep-deprived EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized, but there is a 10 hertz alpha rhythm. There is wicket activity and a small
amount of temporal, shifting slowing. This shifting slowing is more prominent in the left
temporal region with the underlying wicket activity. Features of drowsiness include an
increase in theta, but deeper stages or sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits
a subtle driving response.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. Shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, there were no right
occipital sharp waves identified. There is prominent wicket activity and left temporal
slowing. Because of this, consideration for a more prolonged sleep study would be
helpful to be absolutely certain that there are no left temporal sharp waves.
