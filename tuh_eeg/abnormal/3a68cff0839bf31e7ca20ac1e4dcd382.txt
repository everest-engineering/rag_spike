CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old right handed woman with childhood epilepsy, seizure-free for 45 years.  Seven or 8 years ago she had a breakthrough tonic-clonic seizure and then another one March 15.
MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Zocor, Diltiazem, Mobic, Lisinopril, Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age with an 8.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm.  As the patient becomes drowsy, there is occasional left or right temporal isolated focal slowing.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A patient of this age is permitted occasional right or left temporal isolated slowing.  No epileptiform features were identified.  To more
completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a followup study capturing stage II sleep is suggested.
