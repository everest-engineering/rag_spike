CLINICAL HISTORY: An adult, 68-year-old male with myelodysplastic syndrome on immunosuppression with recent white matter changes and epilepsy. The patient had an episode of tremulousness without impairment of awareness.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Neupogen, Lisinopril, Lasix, Lunesta, Aranesp, Omeprazole, Clonidine, Flomax, Labetalol, Avodart, Amlodipine, Prednisone, Doxazosin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates primarily a rhythmic theta frequency pattern. The overall background is rhythmic, reasonably well organized. There is a small amount of shifting arrhythmic delta activity noted in the temporal regions. Vertex waves are observed out of stage I sleep but sleep is not sustained. There is a slight asymmetry in the frontal regions with slightly higher amplitude activity in the right frontal region compared to the left. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. There is a single right temporal sharp wave noted.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with recent status epilepticus, there is very little in the way of epileptiform activity observed today.
