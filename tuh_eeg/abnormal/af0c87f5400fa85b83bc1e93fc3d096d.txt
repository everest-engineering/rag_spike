CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 67-year-old gentleman with posttraumatic disorder versus epilepsy. Anxiety, hallucinations, panic, and tremulousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Celexa, Ditropan, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was not completed today but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of excess beta and theta noted.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, rare, isolated bursts of focal slowing were noted from either hemisphere.  Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with supra-harmonic driving at 5 Hz.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This electroencephalogram is similar to previous and is mildly abnormal due to:
Mild slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs which have not shown sharp waves or spikes.  In 2010, there was a single EEG with some focal slowing and hyperventilation, but this is the only focal finding that has ever been observed for this patient.  Additional EEG monitoring was undertaken to characterize this patient's spells.
