INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm and a small amount of theta.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG can be seen in the context of depression, dementia, or epilepsy.  No epileptiform features were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study can be obtained.
