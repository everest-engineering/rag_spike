CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old female with refractory epilepsy and encephalopathy.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There is little clinical information about the acute problems with the patient at this time other than the fact that she received 12 mg of Ativan, 8 mg of Versed and 100 mg of fentanyl. In addition, because of her positioning, her electrode placement was slightly modified.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a discontinuous pattern compatible with pharmacologic coma. Despite this, stimulation of the patient does produce reactivity. There is an asymmetry and the activity is more suppressed in the right hemisphere compared to the left. Eye movements are noted.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a pattern compatible with:
1. Pharmacologic coma with burst suppression pattern.
2. An asymmetric pattern more suppressed on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed.
