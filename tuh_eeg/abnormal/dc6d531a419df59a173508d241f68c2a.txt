CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 34-year-old man who presents with acute onset of left-sided weakness and numbness.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm is 9 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by the presence of vertex sharp waves and POSTS.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Heart rate was 80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
