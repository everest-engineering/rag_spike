CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old man status post assault and decompressive craniotomy with diffuse contusions and no bone flap placed, history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffuse slow background that at best reaches 7 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently over the left hemisphere independently at T3, F3, and T3, as well as times independently also over F8/T4.  This is throughout breaching in both regions.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen while in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing in the left hemisphere, specifically the mid temporal and frontal, as well as parietal region.
Slowing in the right temporal region,
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in multiple regions, specifically mainly the left hemisphere and some independently in the right mid temporal region, as well as some diffuse slowing, all of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology, but are likely related to his previous injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
