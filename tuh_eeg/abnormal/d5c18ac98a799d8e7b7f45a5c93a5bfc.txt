CLINICAL HISTORY:  55 year old right handed female with a history of seizures presented with a chief complaint of seizures in the morning, one while hooking up the EEG; first stopped talking, right eye twitch, head shaking, lasting for seconds and then over.  The patient was awake.  Past medical history of diabetes, COPD, hypertension, and CHF.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Insulin, ASA, Lovenox, Percocet, Prednisone, Plavix, Lisinopril, Paxil, Coreg.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizure or epileptiform activity was seen.  It is slightly atypical that the EEG has no abnormalities right after a seizure, although this is not inconsistent with the diagnosis of epilepsy.
