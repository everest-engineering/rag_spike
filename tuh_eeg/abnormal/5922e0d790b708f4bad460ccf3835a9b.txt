CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old woman with epilepsy or possible non epileptic seizures.  The patient reports a strange smell prior to her menstruation and migraine headaches.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response.  Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.  Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  Comparison with this patient's mini previous EEGs may be of value.
