CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 73-year-old with epilepsy, seizure free for the last 5 to 6 years, seizures with aura of dizziness followed by loss of consciousness, and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Neurontin, Carbatrol, Lopressor.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In much of the record, the background EEG is somewhat slow with a posterior dominant rhythm that is about 7.5 Hz.  Briefly the posterior dominant rhythm is a bit faster.  There prominent background theta.  Bursts of drowsiness occur characterized by an increase in background slowing.  Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Because of language limitation, comprehensive testing to make sure that this patient was maximally alert was not performed.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is likely an abnormal EEG due to:
Excess background theta.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified to determine whether or not this is a slow background, a repeat test with cognitive testing should be
performed.  No epileptiform features were seen.  No previous EEGs were available for comparison.
