CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 49-year-old female who presents with episodes of anxiety and right sided shaking, lasting 4-5 minutes along with loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Topiramate, alprazolam, and temazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm was 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is diffuse low amplitude beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in mild symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of the sleep may be helpful.  The generalized beta activity could be due to medication effect including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or could be due to anxiety or hypothyroidism.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
