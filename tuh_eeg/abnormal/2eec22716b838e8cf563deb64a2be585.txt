CLINICAL HISTORY:   32 year old right handed male with chief complaint of staring spells, last month having an episode of loss of consciousness and woke up shaking.  He also has numbness in his hands and legs.
MEDICATIONS:  Xanax, Percocet, Tylenol No. 3.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with generous beta.  In relaxed wakefulness there are occasional single channel artifacts.
Features of sleep include attenuation of the alpha and the appearance of beta activity, as well as some theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving and a background already rich in beta frequency activity.
HR:    48 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG with bradycardia.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study is suggested.
