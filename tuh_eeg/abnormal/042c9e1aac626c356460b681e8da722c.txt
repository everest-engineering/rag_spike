CLINICAL HISTORY: 60 year old male with a history of schizophrenia and right frontal
glioblastoma, admitted with a seizure and prolonged obtundation.
MEDICATIONS: Temazepam, Haldol, Zyprexa. Ativan,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10â•–20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient has been somewhat sedated and is
relatively motionless throughout the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes an abnormal pattern. There
is generous beta In the frontocentral regions and a suggestion of a breech rhythm in the central
regions. Prominent arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity is noted in
the frontotemporal regions bilaterally, more so on the right than on the left, and the activity from
the right frontal region is a bit more featureless when compared to the left. Vertex waves are
noted as the patient transitions into sleep. There is significant variability in the record in terms of
the amount of beta frequency activity. As the patient becomes drowsy, the EEG becomes lower
voltage, slower and intermittently attenuates although it is not frankly discontinuous. Sharply
contoured slowing is noted Intermittently in the frontocentral reg ions.
HR: 120bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Prominent arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity in the
frontotemporal regions, right more so than the left.
3. Occasional sharp waves in the right frontocentral region.
4. Intermittent attenuation of the background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant bihemispheric disturbance, in
particular, one that involves the frontotemporal regions. Although there are a handful of sharp
waves, there are no prominent epileptiform features. Overall this EEG supports a bilateral,
significant disturbance of cerebral function.
