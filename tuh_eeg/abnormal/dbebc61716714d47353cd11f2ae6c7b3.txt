CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male with MR and epilepsy. Past medical history
includes diabetes.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Keppra, Trileptal, Metformin, Haldol, Cogentin, Lexapro.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation was
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG was slow and disorganized.
There was a 6.5 Hz alpha rhythm Identified. There was a lot of EKG artifact. There was
no response to photic stimulation.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing
2. Disorganized with a 6.5 Hz alpha rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform activity was identified. The EEG was slow
and disorganized but the background is similar to other studies. This slowing on the
EEG may be related to structural abnormalities or medication. The absence of
epileptiform activity does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
