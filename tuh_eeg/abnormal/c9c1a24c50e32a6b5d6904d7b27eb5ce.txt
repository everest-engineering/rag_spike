CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old left handed male with hepatic failure.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Zofran, Valganciclovir, Andromeda, Insulin Protonix, Septra Bactrim, Mycamine, Daptomycin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background includes a rhythmic theta pattern. Brief pairs or isolated bursts of frontally predominant 3.5 to 4.5 Hz spike and wave activity are noted.

HR: 114 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing.
2. Frontally predominant 3 to 5 Hz spike and wave activity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing is a nonspecific finding and can be see in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function due to many different causes. This EEG is not as slow or suppressed as the study on 01/25/2010. The epileptiform activity suggests a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.
