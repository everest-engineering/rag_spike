REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges. The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  60.
