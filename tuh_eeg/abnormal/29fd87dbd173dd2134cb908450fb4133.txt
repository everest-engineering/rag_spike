CLINICAL HISTORY:  89 year old right handed woman with a syncopal episode in May.
MEDICATIONS:  Enalapril, Norvasc, Keppra, Aricept, Amlodipine, Gemfibrozil, Levetiracetam, Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, Donepezil
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, there is a small amount of shifting slowing.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing again a bit of shifting slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  An adult of this age is permitted a small amount of shifting slowing and this EEG may have perhaps a bit more than might be otherwise acceptable.  Most remarkable feature is the irregular heart rate.
