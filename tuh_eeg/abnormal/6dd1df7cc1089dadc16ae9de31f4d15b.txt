CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of recurrent syncopal events.  Prior to the events she has periods of tachycardia.  She has a past medical history of sickle cell disease and migraines.
MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin, Dilaudid, aspirin, Lovenox, and Protonix.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EEG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic  stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies with lower   amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess beta is captured.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are present.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no driving.  Single electrocardiogram lead demonstrated the heart rate up to 100 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 24 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Heart rate up to 100 beats per minute is captured on a single
electrocardiogram lead.  Excess beta could be seen secondary to a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
