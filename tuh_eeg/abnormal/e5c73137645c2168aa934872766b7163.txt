CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old woman who is status post orthopedic repair with persistently declining mental status, followed by hypoxemia. Previously with Ativan responsive triphasic waves.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lasix, Albuterol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. There are sections of the record rich in 6 Hz to 8 Hz activity. The patient seems to be poorly interactive with frequent eye blink artifact. In addition to the eye blink, there are occasional frontally predominant triphasic waves and some FIRDA. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the record includes muscle. Interaction with the patient does not clearly change the record. It is more of a dynamic pattern with bursts of delta followed by more of an alpha theta frequency pattern and the occasional triphasic waves.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Markedly improved but abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Paroxysmal delta.
3. Occasional triphasic waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. In contrast to the previous study, there is less in the way of triphasic waves, although there is eye blink artifact, there are not bursts or trains or periodic sharp waves although given the patient's muscle artifact, subtle epileptiform activity would be overlooked. A followup study may be of value.
