CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with a history of a seizure in May of 2012, cerebral cavernoma and childhood ventriculostomy.  The patient required Gamma Knife therapy for vascular pathology in June of 2012.  Unsteady gait, evaluate for possible medication discontinuation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Pravachol, lisinopril.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab  using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed, but not hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9 Hz alpha rhythm of 40-60 microvolts.  There was a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Craniotomy defect was noted with some irregularity on the right.  Prominent lateral rectus eye movement artifact was also noted.  In relaxed wakefulness there was a small amount of frontal theta noted intermittently.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal EEG due to:  Intermittent bifrontal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The findings described above are subtle and are nonspecific in nature.  They may be seen in the context of a bihemispheric process as described above or they may be seen with the use of some medications, although not typically with the medications this patient is receiving.  There were no epileptiform features identified.
