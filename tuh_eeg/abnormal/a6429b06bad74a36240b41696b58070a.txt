CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old man with Noonan Syndrome, refractory epilepsy and recurrent seizures, medication non-adherence.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient was actually drowsy during the acquisition of the record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Although the patient is drowsy throughout much of the record, there are brief sections when there is a low voltage and with some theta and delta. During wakefulness, the patient also exhibits some prominent epileptiform features that are identified during this record. As the tracing begins, there is some right central temporal region sharps and also some spike in wave activity that generates some beta bursts. These are well formed and they are accompanied by after going slow wave. There are actually no clinical symptoms associated with this activity and no additional epileptiform activities are observed.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Epileptiform activity from the right hemisphere with some bursts of sharp waves in the right side that also are seen in the central temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is supportive of a secondary generalized mechanism for epilepsy. There are focus of epileptiform activity seen and identified suggesting a complex mechanism for this individual with epilepsy.
