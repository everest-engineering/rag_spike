CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 52-year-old woman with new onset seizures 2 months ago.  The patient had an episode with loss of consciousness, tongue biting, and postictal confusion, cannot describe other seizures or other medications.
MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicits driving.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta may be due to medications.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
