CLINICAL HISTORY: 85 year old female who fell off 5 steps, now suffering with subdural hematoma and a frontal hematoma.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Keppra, Lopressor. Morphine
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: For this EPOC of the record, the major features are sharply contoured slowing and sharp waves from the right hemisphere, particularly in the temporal regions, which may include the mid to posterior temporal regions. Some are anterior temporal. Discrete left frontal sharp waves are also noted. There are bursts of sharply contoured slowing and brief bursts of sharp waves observed. In this section of the record there are increasing sections with increasing rhythmic theta, particularly on the right. There are also, what appears to be, a sleep pattern noted with more of a lower voltage discontinuous pattern. Intermittent, prominent slow arrhythmic delta activity is noted on the right.
HR: 110 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity with prominent arrhythmic delta activity in the right hemisphere.
3. A pattern with primarily right temporal sharp waves noted at this time.
4. Occasional left frontal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric pathology, but the patient's seizures seem to have certainly slowed down and had stopped in the last 2 days of recording.
