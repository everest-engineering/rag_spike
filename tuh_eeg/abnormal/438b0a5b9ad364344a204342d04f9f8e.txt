CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old woman with epilepsy, seizures characterized by
ringing in the right ear, dizziness, and woke up with tonic-clonic activity.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Diovan, Albuterol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with 10-point 3 Hz alpha rhythm. There is a small amount of wicket activity.
Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Hyperventilation
does not clearly activate the record. There are 2 epileptiform discharges noted in this
record. These include a single well-defined right anterotemporal sharp wave just prior to
photic stimulation and another more subtle during photic. Photic stimulation also elicits
scant driving response.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A single well-defined right anterotemporal sharp wave with another more
equivocal discharge.
CLINICAL The findings described above can be seen in a
localization-related epilepsy.
