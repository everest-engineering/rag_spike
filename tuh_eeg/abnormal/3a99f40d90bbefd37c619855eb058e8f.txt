CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed woman with schizophrenia, COPD,
previous episodes of unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes primarily theta
frequency activity with smaller amounts of beta. There seems to be a bit more rhythmic
slowing from the left compared to the right. Features of drowsiness include an increase
in background slowing.
HR: 102 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Questionable focal features on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the third EEG for this individual. None of the EEGs
have demonstrated epileptiform activity. It is a little bit slower than previous studies. If
additional information regarding her epilepsy is important, a more prolonged and
outpatient recording may be of value.
