CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right handed male with a learning disability, asthma, hypertension and childhood epilepsy, now with 2 episodes of shaking of the body. Previously evaluated for dizziness in 2007.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Ativan, Zolpidem, Divalproex, Lorazepam, Simvastatin, Zyprexa, Zolpidem, Singulair
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 11 Hz, 50 microvolt alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmic theta and followed by vertex waves. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude at background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This was the second normal EEG for this individual. A previous normal EEG was seen in 2007.
