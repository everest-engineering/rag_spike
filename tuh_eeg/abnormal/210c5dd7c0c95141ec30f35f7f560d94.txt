INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetrically reactive to eye opening. Stage II sleep is characterized by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles and posts. Hyperventilation produces an increases an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 50 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing is suggested.
