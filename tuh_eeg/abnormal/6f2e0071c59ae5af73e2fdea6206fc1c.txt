CLINICAL HISTORY:  52 year old right handed woman with a seizure in 2006 characterized by feelings of dizziness, nausea, then tonic-clonic activity.  Subsequently, she had paroxysmal dizziness and nausea, but has had no symptoms for 1 year, history of depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Remeron, Dilantin
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness there is some bursts of shifting slowing, but there is more prominent, left temporal focal slowing with some sharply contoured slowing and even some sharp waves noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the left temporal focal slowing.  There is wicket activity noted in both temporal regions, but there is also a subtle, underlying left temporal sharp wave.  Later sections of hyperventilation includes some head rocking artifacts. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, followed by POSTs.  As the patient transitions in and out of a drowsy state, the left anterior temporal focal slowing reappears. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.  The patient starts to drift in and out sleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal due to:
Left temporal focal slowing.
Left temporal sharp waves.
Shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves were identified in 2006.  There is some shifting slowing at this time, which may be an age-
related phenomenon.
