CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old right handed female with complaint of generalized
headaches 4-5 times per week with cerebral palsy, cerebellar damage, ataxia, scoliosis,
and asthma.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Albuterol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm,
which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. It is approximately 40 microvolts in
amplitude. It is similar in both right and left. Drowsiness is characterized by
background slowing and POSTS. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of
the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Eye artifact is identified in the temporal region in the transition to sleep, but there is no focal slowing or sharp waves.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.
The amplitude asymmetry seen in the previous study was not identified today, but this
was technically a better study. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a prolonged
monitoring study can be considered.
