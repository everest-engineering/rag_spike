LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman who had a fall several days ago and hit her head on the left side.  She subsequently became confused, complaining of a headache.  She was subsequently found to have right parietal bleed.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications:  Digoxin, Lipitor, Synthroid, tramadol.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic mixture of theta and delta activity.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
FINDINGS:
Moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing.
No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute awake-only EEG due to moderate-to-severe diffuse background slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific moderate-to-severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clear electrographic seizures were captured.
