CLINICAL HISTORY: 76 year old right handed woman with recurrent weakness, ataxia, collapse. History of cerebrovascular disease, aneurysm, facial weakness, hypertension, reflux.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lisinopril, Levothyroxine, Zocor
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low voltage 9 Hertz alpha rhythm. There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing particularly in the left mid temporal region. Some of this on the left is slightly sharply contoured. There are occasional isolated bursts of frontal delta. Features of drowsiness include small Increase in theta. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.
HR: 78 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
2. A small amount of theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is better organized than the previous EEG which was recorded in April for a seizure. Neither of these EEGs identified epileptiform activity.
