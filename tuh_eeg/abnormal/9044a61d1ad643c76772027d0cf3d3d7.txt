CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed woman with a history of schizophrenia and epilepsy. The patient ran out of her medication and suffered 3 tonic clonic seizures on July 15, 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Seroquel, Protonix, Serax, Folic Acid, Thiamine, Flagyl
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is quite restless.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When maximally awake there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Some sections of the wake record demonstrate a small degree of disorganization and in the transition to sleep there is a small amount of shifting slowing. Wicket activity is noted. The patient has paroxysms or chewing movements which are not associated with epileptiform activity. POSTS are observed as she drifts into sleep. Photic stimulation is performed as she is drifting into sleep.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild, intermittent disorganization.
2. Occasional shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are nonspecific and maybe due to this patient's neurologic features, her medications, or psychiatric pathology. No epileptiform features were noted.
