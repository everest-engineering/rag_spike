CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old left handed male admitted on the 18th with right sided shaking. Past history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 8 years ago and question craniotomy defect.
MEDICATIONS: Zonegran.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the right compared to the left, but not outside of the range of normal. There is generous background beta.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The amplitude asymmetry described above is within normal limits. Additional outpatient evaluation may be appropriate to capture epileptiform activity.
