REASON FOR STUDY:  Continuous intractable seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old woman with history of narcolepsy, sleep apnea, diabetes, intractable seizures, transferred for status, now with recurrent episodes.
MEDICATIONS:  Not mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A long-term EEG was performed from 03/16/2012 through 03/17/2012 for a period of 14 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with anterior temporal, single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  All events were reviewed using continuous spike detection software as well as seizure detection software and patient along with nurse-reported events.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is no __________ central beta.  The patient reaches stages I, II, III, IV and REM sleep during the recording, however, there are multiple arousals throughout the night.  No intercurrent procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focused slow wave seen independently at T3 and T4 occasionally throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
EVENTS:  On 03/17/2012 at 6:00 a.m. the patient is aroused by the nurse to take vitals when she suddenly turns her head to the right, her left arm and right arm become stiff and start trembling irregularly.  She is unresponsive to verbal commands and continues to shake her upper body for about 2-3 minutes, afterwards she subsides, coughs and later on starts again minutes later.  One of the residents comes to see her, and she continues to do this behavior for about 20-25 minutes and then calms and falls asleep.  During this entire episode, the EEG does not reveal any epileptiform activity and has a normal awake background.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent bilateral slow waves.  In addition, the captured episode described above had no EEG correlate.
