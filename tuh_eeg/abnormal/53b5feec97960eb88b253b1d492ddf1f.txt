CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old with a 1-minute staring spell 2 weeks ago.
Of note, this patient has had many previous EEGs in 2003, 2008 with long-term monitoring, and then followup in 2009.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing as well as anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Rhythmic mid-temporal state of drowsiness was noted.
Hyperventilation produces rhythmic slowing.  Otic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  A handful of normal variants were noted in this EEG.
