LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old man with a complicated past medical history who presented with status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The voltages are diffusely very low.  The background consists of a mixture of low voltage fast activity in the beta frequency range mixed with frequent periods of background discontinuity.  No normal sleep architecture is present.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  There is reactivity to visual auditory tactile and noxious stimulation characterized by   overall improvement in the background discontinuity.
FINDINGS:
A frequent period of discontinuity.
Diffuse beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very abnormal 21 minute comatose EEG due to nearly continuous low-voltage beta activity and frequent periods of discontinuity.  These findings indicate etiologically nonspecific moderate to severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction that could partially be related to a medication effect.  Beta could be secondary to a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No electrographic seizures were captured.  These findings were conveyed to the Primary Team.
