REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 64-year-old man with a history of seizures and diabetes who presented after a fall and noted to have a change in mental status, a large bifrontal intracerebral hemorrhage and edema.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, sertraline, Zocor, gabapentin, phenytoin, and glipizide.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic. Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
Technical difficulties:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 7 Hz and does not appear to be reacting to eye opening.  There is the lack of normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded while in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal slow waves seen in the right hemisphere, maximal in the F8/T4 electrodes at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.  In addition, there is generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right hemispheric slowing, maximal in the anterior temporal region, in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right hemisphere, maximal in the temporal region with additional moderate diffuse
cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
