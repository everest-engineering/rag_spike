CLINICAL HISTORY: 56 year old left handed woman with tonic-clonic seizures, 6
seizures since January. Epilepsy for the past 13 years. Past history of stroke, asthma and hepatic disease.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Keppra, Zofran, Clonazepam, Lactulose
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is somewhat disorganized.
In addition, there is an amplitude asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the left compared to the right. There is no description of previous craniotomy defect to account for the amplitude asymmetry. There are occasional bursts of focal slowing from the left, and in the context of this amplitude asymmetry there are a handful of discrete sharp waves at T3. There is also wicket activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, a bit more remarkable on the right compared to the left but generous bilaterally.
The focal slowing is a bit more prominent occurring in isolated bursts in drowsiness. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is falling asleep and does not clearly activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A somewhat disorganized pattern.
2. Focal slowing from the left hemisphere with higher amplitude activity there.
3. Likely underlying left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings can be correlated with imaging. A focal
mechanism for seizures should be considered.
