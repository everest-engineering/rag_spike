CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed man with history of epilepsy and prior traumatic head injury.  He is here for follow up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is some intermittent right temporalis muscle artifact seen intermittently over the right hemisphere.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to an EEG with a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 8.5 to 9 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  This posterior dominant rhythm is of low amplitude, but can be seen.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient easily goes into drowsiness, stage I, and stage II sleep.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.
