CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old  woman with seizures following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage repair.  Past history of accidental salicylate overdose in 2009.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamotrigine, Folate Acid, HCTZ, Levothyroxine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta.  There is a prominent breach rhythm in the left temporal region.  In the same region, there is prominent left temporal rhythmic theta.  Despite the breach rhythm, there are left midtemporal sharp waves.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.  The left anterior temporal focal slowing becomes more prominent, with more rhythmic high-amplitude slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response better identified on the right than the left.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent focal slowing from the left, particularly frontotemporal regions.
In the context of a breach rhythm, there are left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the left as well as a partial mechanism for epilepsy.  The sharp waves suggest an ongoing potential for seizures.
