LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C, polysubstance abuse, seizures, and depression who had questionable seizure-like activity while in a CAT scan.  Six mg of Ativan was subsequently given.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan 6 mg and Dilaudid 1 mg during the EEG.  Percocet, Keppra, Advair, nicotine patch, morphine, Protonix, and insulin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  Early in the recording there is a significant EMG artifact due to the patient locking his jaw.  Additionally, an episode of rapid generalized shaking is captured.  This episode lasted approximately 20 to 30 seconds.  Electrographically, it is associated with diffuse pronounced EMG artifact without associated ictal activity prior, during or after the episode.
FINDINGS:
Episode of shaking without  abnormal ictal activity.
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 26 minute EEG.  An episode of generalized shaking was not associated with abnormal ictal activity captured on scalp EEG.
