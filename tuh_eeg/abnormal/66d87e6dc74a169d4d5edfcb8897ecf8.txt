REASON FOR STUDY:  Right-sided weakness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old man with increased left-sided weakness, also right MCA stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  None mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta in the left hemisphere and some decreased attenuated amplitude over the right hemisphere.
Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Right hemisphere attenuation and focal slowing is seen intermittently at F4.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right hemisphere attenuation of faster frequency and focal slowing in the right frontal region
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral cortical dysfunction in the right hemisphere, maximal in the frontal region, which is consistent with an old stroke. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
