CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old female with epilepsy since 2000, status post
childhood head trauma. Seizure free
since March 11, 2010. Asymmetric limb length.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with
a modest amount of low voltage frontocentral beta and theta. Hyperventilation is
Â·performed early on in the record and produces bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant
3 Hz spike and wave activity. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response bilaterally. The
transition to sleep is characterized by an increase in beta and theta.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are important to correlate with previous
EEGs. This suggests a generalized and even an inherited mechanism for epilepsy.
