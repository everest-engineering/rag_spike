CLINICAL HISTORY:  35 year old woman with status epilepticus this morning with focal seizures.  Previous stroke, end-stage HIV, in hospice.
MEDICATIONS:  Propofol, Ativan, Dilantin, Zofran, Hydroxyzine, Hydrocort, Prilosec, Diflucan, Clarithromycin, ASA, Atripla, Percocet, Valcyte, Zofran, Ethambutol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside in using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Patient is intubated and obtunded.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, feature list pattern.  There are some underlying asymmetries in posterior delta, but these are not prominent in the severely low voltage record.  There are occasional bursts of delta followed by an alpha frequency pattern.  Stimulation of the patient does not particularly activate the record.  There is some slow rolling eye movements noted.
HR:    110 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Replacement of normal background with a low voltage slow pattern.
Occasional bursts of delta.
Occasional arouses with arousal faster frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  The pattern described above can be seen as a postictal pattern.  If additional information is needed,
a follow-up study as the patient emerges from the use of propofol and other sedative hypnotic doses of medications for acute repetitive seizures is suggested.
