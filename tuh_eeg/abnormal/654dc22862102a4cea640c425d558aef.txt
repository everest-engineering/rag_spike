REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old man with history of seizures, presented in status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin and phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and lethargy/stuporous.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Heart rate is 90.
The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There were no activating procedures.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at T5 and at times moved more forward to T3 and very rarely at T6.
Focal slowing seen at T5 frequently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.
Generalized slowing at 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
There were intermittent bursts of prolonged lasting frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left posterotemporal and midtemporal sharp waves with rare right posterotemporal sharp waves in addition to generalized slowing of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the left posterotemporal or even the right posterotemporal region. There is also evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left posterotemporal region , which is non-specific with regards to etiology.  Lastly there is evidence of  generalized cerebral dysfunction, of which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures were seen.
