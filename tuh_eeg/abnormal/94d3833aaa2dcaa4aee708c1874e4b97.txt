CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed female presents with a history of seizures and status post vaginal delivery on March 8, 2012, history of Xanax abuse, follow up with continuous seizures, the last one with loss of consciousness, bladder incontinence, and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  There is an excessive amount of beta seen throughout the recording and very pronounced in the central region.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen rarely at C3.
Focal slowing seen frequently at C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left central sharp waves and slowing.
Excessive beta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal dysfunction and irritability in the left central region who has a high correlation with seizures arising from
the region.  In addition, there is excessive beta which may be at least in part due to a medication like benzodiazepine and/or barbiturate.  No seizures were seen.
