CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right-handed woman with intermittent dizzy spells
and memory impairment.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed but photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm.
Alpha squeak is observed with an increase in frequency of the alpha. There is
generous background beta. This record is upper limits in terms of background theta.
Drowsiness Is not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral vigorous driving.

HR: 78bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG was within normal limits for an adult of this age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The alpha squeak phenomenon and the vigorous driving
are both normal phenomenon. If this individual is thought to have seizures, a more
prolonged study may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity. If these are thought
to be confusional spells, outpatient EEG monitoring can be helpful.
