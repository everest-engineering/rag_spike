REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 65-year-old male with an episode of all and generalized tonic-clonic shaking, postictal confusion, and urinary incontinence.  In the ER, confused, given Ativan.  He has a history of CHF and status post AICD.
MEDICATIONS:  Lorazepam p.r.n., heparin, thiamine, and Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen intermittently at F8/T4, slightly more than F7/T3 while in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen occasionally at F8/T4, and independently at F7/T3.
HEART RATE:  120.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bilateral anterior temporal sharp waves and slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising from either anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures were seen.
