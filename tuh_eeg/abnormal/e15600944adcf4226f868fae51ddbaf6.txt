CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old female with recurrent seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topamax, Depakote, Keppra, Klonopin, Senna, Protonix,
Lorazepam, Morphine, Metoprolol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a disorganized
pattern with primarily theta and delta. There are some sharply contoured transients
including the frontal regions, right more so than the left but with also some triphasic
waves and some occasional left anterior temporal sharp waves. Stimulation of the
patient produces an increase in muscle artifact.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Triphasic waves.
3. Occasional frontal sharp waves, right more than left, and occasional left temporal
sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Many of these findings have been identified in previous
EEGs. The background slowing is more remarkable than some of her prior studies.
