CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed woman with status epilepticus on April 2, 2010.
Hx of alcoholic dementia and CHI.

MEDICATIONS: Trileptal.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation nor photic simulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG in wakefulness is disorganized. There is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9Hz in the background with excess theta. There is an asymmetry in the alpha rhythm and at times it is more prominent on the left with more beta  activity on the right. Shifting slowing is observed but the slowing is more prominent on the right compared to the left and there is a right frontal sharp and slow wave complex noted. As the patient becomes drowsy, the right frontal epileptiform activity is more well defined with a spike and slow wave morphology, then spread to the frontotemporal region and phase reversal at F8 or FP2. In addition, in the later portions of the record where epileptiform activity is more prominent, the focal slowing in the right hemisphere is also more prominent with more disruption of faster frequency activity.

HR: 70 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right frontal sharp waves.
2. Generalized background slowing.
3. Focal slowing in the right hemisphere.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. These findings may be correlated with the MRI. No seizures were recorded.
