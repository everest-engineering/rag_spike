CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed woman with episodes of deja vu which
can be triggered by smells. Symptoms began in 2002. History of depression.
MEDICATIONS: Effexor, propranolol, Ortho Tri-Cyclen.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is
appropriately organized for a young adult with a 9.5 Hz, 50 to 60 microvolt posterior
dominant rhythm and posterior slow waves of youth. Electrode artifact is identified at T4.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Brief drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this record.
There was a single burst of right temporal slowing identified in drowsiness and this must
be considered artifactual as it occurred on only 1 occasion. To more completely
evaluate this young adult for complex partial epilepsy, a repeat tracing capturing sleep
or an outpatient ambulatory study capturing one of her spells Is suggested.
