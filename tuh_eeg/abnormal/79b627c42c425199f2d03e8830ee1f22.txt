CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed woman with hypertension, high
cholesterol, diabetes and anxiety who had an episode in which she was found on the floor, confused, with garbled speech. This is a repeat EEG.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Keppra, Lovastatin, ASA, Zoloft, Alprazolam, Tramadol, Ambien, Pioglitazone, Ezetimibe, Omeprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized with an 8.7 Hz, 50 mV alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude. Photic stimulation does not produce a driving response. Minimal drowsiness was seen with anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
HR: 66bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a repeat study may be considered. This patient's previous EEG was not available for comparison today.
