CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old female found by husband after drinking with a right ear laceration and inappropriate behavior.  CT demonstrated left temporal intracerebral hemorrhage and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Morphine, Zofran, Famotidine, Cefazolin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at beside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is in a hard collar and is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The majority of the record demonstrates a diffusely slow pattern, medium amplitude with lower voltage theta and smaller amounts of beta.  There is subtle asymmetry with a bit more arrhythmic delta activity noted in the left temporal region than the right.  Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an increase in faster frequency activity.  Spontaneous arousals are noted.  Shifting asymmetries are also seen, which was characterized by vertex waves.
HR:    72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Diffusely slow pattern.
Shifting asymmetries with more disruption of faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There were no epileptiform features identified.
This EEG supports a bihemispheric process, one impacting the left temporal region more than the right.  If addition information is needed or if there are additional concerns
about t
he seizures, a follow-up study as the patient improves may be performed in the lab.
