CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old right-handed male admitted on the 2nd with a syncopal episode lasting 15 to 20 minutes with post ictal confusion.  Anxiety, depression, bipolar disease and a history of assault in 2006.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, tramadol, Seroquel.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient had a very dirty scalp. In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with symmetric and reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in rhythmicity of the background, anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in frontocentral theta.
Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
