REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old woman with a past medical history of an AVM, status post surgeries and strokes with seizures.  She has been seizure free for years, but has had some intermittent feelings of off balance within the month of June.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that is best seen over the left hemisphere and reaches 9 Hz.  There is normal frontal central beta seen over the left hemisphere only.  Over the right hemisphere the posterior dominant rhythm is disrupted and the frontal central beta is accentuated and a large area of amplitude consistent with a breach, which I will describe in the abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F8/T4 and independently at T4 in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal sharp waves seen also at F7/T3 and at T3, but only occasionally.  These are also seen in wakefulness and sleep.
Continuous focal slowing seen over T4 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV with an associated increasing faster frequency in amplitude consistent with a breach rhythm.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to independent right anterior temporal and mid temporal sharp waves, as well as left mid temporal and anterior temporal sharp waves.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural dysfunction and irritability over the right mid temporal region which is consistent with a known AVM and surgery.  No seizures were seen.
