CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed woman with a 5 year history of
recurrent syncope last in July 2010. The patient just falls out
MEDICATIONS: Clonidine, Reyataz, Epzicom, Norvir, Bactrim, HCTZ, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep
record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm
reaching 50 microvolts. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record producing an
increase in amplitude of the background. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
beta. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a
repeat study capturing sleep is suggested.
