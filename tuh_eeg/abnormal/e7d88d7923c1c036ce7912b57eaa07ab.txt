CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old right handed woman with recurrent episodes of confusion, words do not make sense, difficulty finding words, and slumped in the chair leaning towards the right side, diabetes, gout, heart disease.
MEDICATIONS: Cozaar, Ibuprofen, Elavil, Norvasc

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm, age appropriate quantities of occasional right or left temporal theta are noted. Wicket is also observed in the temporal regions. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits for a subject of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The subject of this age has permitted occasional temporal theta from the left to right temporal region. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study with more extensive sleep is suggested.
