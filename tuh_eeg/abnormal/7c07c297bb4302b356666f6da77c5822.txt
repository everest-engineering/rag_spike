LENGTH OF EEG:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old man who had 3 episodes of loss of consciousness while eating seafood/shellfish.  The last such event occurred on 12/31/2012.  As per patient, after eating the aforementioned foods he felt hot, throat began to swell and feeling tight, and then he lost consciousness and woke up with hives.
MEDICATIONS:  No medications mentioned.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transient of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, and spindles are captured.
Hyperventilation produces bursts of diffuse delta, as well as mild diffuse symmetrical background slowing.
Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at high frequency flash rate.
A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:  No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 23-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
