CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old woman with daily headaches associated with
dizziness.
MEDICATIONS: Fioricet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard .10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm
identified with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient
drifts off to sleep early in the record. She is awakened for hyperventilation which
produces rhythmic slowing followed by stage I sleep with vertex waves. Vertex waves,
K-complexes and spindles and POSTS are observed in stage II sleep. Photic
stimulation Is performed as the patient Is drifting in and out of sleep, but there is a scant driving response observed.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this
record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an
important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be useful.
