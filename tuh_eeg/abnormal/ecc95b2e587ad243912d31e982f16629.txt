CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 32-year-old gentleman with episodes of loss of consciousness and seizure-like activity. They usually last 5-10 seconds with post confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10-11 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  There were no epileptiform activity or electrographic seizures are noted during this recording.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in no driving response.  Heart rate is 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a prolonged EEG monitoring maybe helpful.
