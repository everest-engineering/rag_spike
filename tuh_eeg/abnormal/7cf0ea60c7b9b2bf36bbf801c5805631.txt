HISTORY: 63 year old right handed male left carotid stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: ASA, Plavix, Metformin, Glipizide. Simvastatin,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is photic stimulation but
no hyperventilation.
OF THE RECORD: The patient is drowsy throughout much of the EEG
with a light sleep state and generous beta and some rhythmic central. theta. There is
electrode pop or electrode artifact noted in both temporal electrodes. Photic stimulation
is performed while the patient is relatively sleepy with scant driving and the ongoing
electrode artifact.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This study will be used as a baseline for his carotid
endarterectomy. Hopefully the two electrodes in question, the T1 and T2, are not
typically utilized in the carotid endarterectomy study.
