CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed male with right-sided weakness and tingling.

MEDICATIONS: Tylenol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage but there is a 9 Hertz, 25 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing followed by POSTS. There is a significant section of the record with a drowsy pattern with slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude with a background.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. This is a somewhat low voltage record but again is not necessarily indicative of pathology.
