TYPE OF STUDY:  Outpatient EEG.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Previous left thalamic infarct, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, right-sided numbness, now with 3 blackout spells over the past year.  The patient feels weak and then faints.  On 1 occasion she just went blank, but on another occasion, she felt fine afterwards and then experienced weakness 15 minutes later.
MEDICATIONS:  Diovan, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm at 50-70 microvolts.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta as well as anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.  Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified.  There were no focal findings noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged tracing capturing sleep or a sleep-deprived EEG may be of value.
