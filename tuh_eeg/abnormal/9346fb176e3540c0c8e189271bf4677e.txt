CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old year old woman with impaired memory, loss of
balance, tremulousness, cervical radiculopathy and hypersomnolence.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the
record producing an increase in rhythm theta. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior
spread of the alpha. Frontal temporal eye movement artifact is slightly asymmetric.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 54 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. The
slightly asymmetric eye movement raises the question of electrode placement.
