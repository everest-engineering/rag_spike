CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a36-year-old woman with a past medical history of epileptic and nonepileptic events.  She now presents with an increase in seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamotrigine, Dilantin, Synthroid.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the  standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient, with faster frequencies at lower amplitude anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving a multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 23 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
