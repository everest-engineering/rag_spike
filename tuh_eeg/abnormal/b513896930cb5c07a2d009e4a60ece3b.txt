CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old with right MCA infarct in 2009, left hemiparesis, drug and alcohol abuse, admitted after recurrent tonoclonic seizures after alcohol and drug ingestion.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, Thiamine, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent, but with brief arousals.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  With arousals, a low voltage, well-defined awake pattern is noted from the left with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm. The right hemisphere demonstrates intermittent, arrhythmic delta.  Vertex waves, K-complexes and spindles are noted in stage II sleep.
This is a dynamic pattern, as the recording continues, occasional frontal spikes are noted more so on the right than the left.  In addition, the focal slowing and the generalized background slowing is more prominent in the initial sections of the record.
Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
Right frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The focal slowing and the sharp waves are ipsilateral to the patient's stroke.  This EEG supports a
focal mechanism for the patient's seizures.  This is a dynamic, postictal pattern with a more awake individual at the end of the recording.
