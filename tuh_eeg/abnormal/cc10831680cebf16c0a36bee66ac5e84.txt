INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  Please note that throughout the recording she has prominent nystagmoid eye movements.
Abnormal discharges:  None.  Please note that she does have some intermittent bursts of diffuse alpha discharge, frequency of bursts seen diffusely, which appear to be most consistent with a burst of drowsiness.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
