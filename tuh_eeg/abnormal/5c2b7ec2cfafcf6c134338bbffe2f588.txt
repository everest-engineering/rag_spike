LENGTH OF RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 24 -year-old woman who has a history of seizure onset at 13 days old following meningitis.  Seizures are described as twitching of the left side of the face with associated tongue biting. These episodes last approximately 5 to 10 minutes.  Last such event occurred in approximately 2004/ 2005.
MEDICATIONS:  Currently Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude well-formed 10 to 10.5 alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients in sleep) and symmetrical vertex waves are captured.  Stage II sleep is not recorded.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 24 minutes EEG.   The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
