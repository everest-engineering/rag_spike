CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old female with history of seizures, presents with episode of shaking and falling.  She is unaware that she is shaking and there is no loss of consciousness.  Last episode of shaking today.
MEDICATIONS:  Levothroid
REASON FOR STUDY:  Convulsions.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and limited sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no normal discharges and photic driving does produce nice normal driving.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.  However, there is a single sharp transient with a bifrontal field which is suspicious, but not clearly pathologic seen only once during the recording.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and limited sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   The single sharp transient seen may be better defined with prolonged recording capturing longer and deeper stages of sleep.
