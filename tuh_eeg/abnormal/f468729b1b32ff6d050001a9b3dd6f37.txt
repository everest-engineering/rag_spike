CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old gentleman with epilepsy and a history of left temporal glioblastoma as well as hypertensive neuropathy, admitted with a seizure and complaint of being dizzy.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Neurontin, Oxycontin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an intrahemispheric asymmetry. The right hemisphere demonstrates a 9 Hz alpha rhythm in a background with excess beta and excess theta as well as a modest-degree of disorganization. The left hemisphere includes some defects perhaps due to the shape of the patientâ•’s skull, but arrhythmic delta activity is seen almost continuously in the left posterior temporal and central parietal region. This is particularly sharply contoured at C3 and P3. Features of drowsiness and include an increase in beta. The left parietal delta becomes higher amplitude and a more clearly defined P3 sharp wave is noted as the patient transitions into stage II sleep.
Hyperventilation accentuates the focal slowing. Photic stimulation is remarkable for artifacts in the T6 electrode but no significant driving response.
HR: 78bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing in the left central parietal region and posterior temporal region.
2. P3 sharp waves.
3. Slowing from the right hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The findings described above are congruent with a neurosurgical history. The generalized background slowing may be correlated with imaging and clinical events.
