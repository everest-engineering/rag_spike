CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed gentleman with epilepsy, increase in seizures with 3 seizures per day characterized by dizziness and shaking on the left or the right, loss of speech, and then unresponsiveness.  In addition, the patient has laugh attacks 3 times per day.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Dilantin, Seroquel, Klonopin, Lovenox, Pantoprazole,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The overall EEG is poorly organized.  There is a 7 Hz alpha rhythm.  At times the alpha rhythm seems to be disrupted on the right compared to the left.  In this sharply contoured record, there is intermittent arrhythmic delta on the right.  There are a handful of subtle underlying sharp waves noted in the right hemisphere, particularly frontal central. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background.
Shifting slowing particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Epileptiform activity was not particularly prominent in this record.  The overall pattern is one of shifting slowing with more disruption of faster
frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
