CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old male with history of head trauma and diffuse axonal brain injury, who reports fall.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency, 60-70 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  The stage I sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact, as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  The stage II sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 55 beats per minutes and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage II sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.  Note that the heart rate was 55 and patient was bradycardic.
