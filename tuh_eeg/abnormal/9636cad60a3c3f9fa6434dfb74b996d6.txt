BASELINE EEG
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman with a strong family history of epilepsy, nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic jerks.  Vagal nerve stimulator.  There is a history of head trauma.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10-Hz alpha rhythm but there is a small amount of 7-Hz theta noted in the background.  Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record and produced an increase in theta.  As the patient transitioned in and out of stage 2 sleep, rare spike and slow-wave complexes were identified.  There was a burst of high-amplitude spike and polyspike activity in sleep which was generalized.  There was an additional subtle spike in sleep noted in the right frontal region.  Sleep was not sustained.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was transitioning in and out of sleep.  A photic driving response with harmonic and supraharmonic driving was observed but without spike and wave activity.  An additional burst of polyspike activity was noted as the patient was drifting off to sleep again at the end of photic stimulation.
Heart rate:  72 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized spike and wave activity as the patient transitioned in and out of sleep.
Polyspike and slow-wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings have previously been seen in this individual.  Although not many abnormalities were identified, most of them were
generalized, not focal.  These may be correlated with clinical history and imaging, but this EEG is more supportive of a primary rather than secondary generalized epilepsy.
