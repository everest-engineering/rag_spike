CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed male with past medical history of hypertension, cardiac catheterization x2, CHF, gallstones, gout and plate in left face who presents with past medical history of seizure associated with alcohol use, now not having seizures after stopping alcohol use.
MEDICATIONS:  Not known.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  Wave form in sleep were recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 hertz at an amplitude of 20 to 50 microvolts and normal frontocentral beta seen. In general, there is a low amplitude to the recording, but no specific abnormalities are seen with sleep or photic stimulation.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGE:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Prolonged recording may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
