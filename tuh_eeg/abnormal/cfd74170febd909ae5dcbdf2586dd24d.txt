CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old with new onset seizures characterized by tremors in
the right arm, eye twitching, loss of consciousness. The patient reports pins and
needles for the past 3 months and a past history of syncope while dehydrated.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz, 30 microvolt,
posterior dominant rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a
small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
an increase in theta and then an increase in beta. Hyperventilation elicits scant slowing
and photic stimulation elicits a small amount of driving.
HR: 72 bpm and slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in this record. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study capturing deeper stages of
sleep may be of use.
