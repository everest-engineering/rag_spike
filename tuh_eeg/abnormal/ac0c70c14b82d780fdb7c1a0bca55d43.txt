CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old male with new onset seizures in February and March 2011 with tonic clonic activity of tongue, body, and loss of consciousness, followed by headache. He has a long history of frequent headaches, HIV positive since birth. Seizures were associated with sleep deprivation and a new infant.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a well defined, 10 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Hyperventilation produces rhythmic slowing, particularly in the frontal regions. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and an increase in rhythmic theta. POSTS are noted in early sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed in this EEG. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
