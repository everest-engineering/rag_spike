CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with epilepsy, seizure-free for 3 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
TECHNICAL:  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the frontal regions.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta and slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response and eye artifacts.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. No previous EEGs were available for comparison.  In this seizure-free adult, if additional information is needed, a review of previous EEGs may be of use.
