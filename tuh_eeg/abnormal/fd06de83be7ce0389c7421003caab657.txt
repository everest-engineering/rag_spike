CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old right handed male with a history of hypertension and schizophrenia with past medical history of seizures since 1990, last seizure in 2010.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Lisinopril, Seroquel, Clonazepam, Ambien, Motrin, Claritin, Aspirin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  The EEG was recorded in wakefulness and sleep stage I, stage II.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz with a 20-60 mV amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  Sleep is characterized by Stage I and stage II.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation does not produce any abnormal discharges.  There is a slight increased amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
