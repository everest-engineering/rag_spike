CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old man with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, dementia, and multiple strokes presents with an episode of becoming nonverbal with right gaze preference.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra
REASON FOR STUDY:   Seizures
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a slightly disorganized background with a posterior dominant rhythm that in general reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient appears to go into sleep but no normal sleep architecture is seen.  Photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There are bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) seen frequently throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
