CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed woman with a history of orthostatic
hypotension and usual episode 2 weeks ago while driving a car in which she had
numbness in both hands followed by lightheadedness, visual changes and then perioral
and right hand numbness. Past history of orthostatic hypotension. These symptoms
were followed by confusion and migraine headache.

MEDICATIONS: Prenatal Vit.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
symmetric, reactive, 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage,
frontocentral beta activity. Both drowsiness and hyperventilation are associated with
slowing of the alpha rhythm to 8.5 Hz rhythmic paroxysmal mixed frontal theta and
delta. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained but there are brief vertex waves.
Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR: 60bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. There is rhythmic
paroxysmal stowing identified in hyperventilation which Is an anticipated finding in a
fasting adult.
