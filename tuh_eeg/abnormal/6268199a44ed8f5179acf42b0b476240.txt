CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old man with prior history of alcohol use/abuse, now presents with one episode of generalized tonic clonic convulsion that occurred one week ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During drowsiness diffuse theta and bursts of frontally predominant delta are captured.  Stage II sleep is not recorded.
Hyperventilation is performed and results in no change in the background.
Photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
Regular cardiac rate is noted on the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for a seizure persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
