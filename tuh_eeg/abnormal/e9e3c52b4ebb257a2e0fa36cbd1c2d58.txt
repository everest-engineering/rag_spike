REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 64-year-old woman with a fall and declining mental status with a right bifrontal intracerebral hemorrhage and edema, history of diabetes, and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, pantoprazole, Zosyn, vancomycin, rifaximin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead  EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while obtunded.  Activating procedures were not performed.  No sleep was captured.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffuse slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  There is no activating procedures performed.  No abnormal sleep architecture was seen.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen continuously at F3 at a frequency of 1 Hz consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED) which at times the morphology is blunted, but it can be clearly seen, especially when the patient is more aroused.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording.
Slight decrease amplitude over the right hemisphere, particularly over the frontal regions.
During the recording the patient stimulated and there appears to be some reactivity to the EEG.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left frontal PLED, as well as right frontal decreased amplitude, in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left frontal cortical dysfunction and irritability, as well as right frontal possible cortical dysfunction versus overlying hemorrhage on that region, in addition to diffuse cerebral slowing, which is more nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures were clearly seen.
