LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  26 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 56-year-old man with a past medical history of a stroke in August of 2012.  He subsequently has left-sided weakness.  Of note, he also has left facial numbness and muscle spasms of his left face that occur every day.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and aspirin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated 9.5 to 10 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness background voltage attenuates and rare vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation results in no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in no change in the background.  A single electrocardiogram lead demonstrates a heart rate with few than 60 beats a minutes.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Sinus bradycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 26 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persistent, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit. The sinus bradycardia with fewer than 60 beats a minutes is noted on a single electrocardiogram lead.
