CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old right handed male status post head injury with tonic/clonic convulsions, now with recurrent seizures.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Increased seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine
INTRODUCTION:  Long term digital video EEG was performed at bedside for 16-1/2 hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system and anterior, temporal, and EKG electrodes.  Continuous seizure detection software as well as spike detection software were utilized and supplemented by a patient-activated alarm, nursing observation, and testing.  The video/EEG files were reviewed on a daily basis.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz at 20-50 microvolts amplitude with normal frontal central beta seen.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed with no abnormal discharges.  Sleep, all stages are seen normally.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
No epileptiform activity was seen.
Ictal or epileptiform activity captured:  No patient button events were captured and no seizure activity was captured on this first day of recording.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This first day of long-term video EEG monitoring did not reveal any abnormal epileptiform discharges or seizures.
