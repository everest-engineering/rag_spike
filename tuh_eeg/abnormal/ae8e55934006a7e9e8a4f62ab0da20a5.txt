CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 74-year-old male with a history of epilepsy, previous EEG in 2007, history of head trauma at that time.
The patient recently referred from cardiology and primary care doctor for syncope, but patient told the lab that he has a history of seizures characterized by tonic clonic activity with shaking and loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, phenytoin, glipizide, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In comparison to previous EEGs in 2007, an acute post traumatic EEG showed sharp waves, but the follow up study did not.
