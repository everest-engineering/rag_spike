CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old left handed female with episodes of sweating, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, vomiting, dizziness and post sleepiness. Patient has past history of asthma, hiatal hernia and allergies.
MEDICATIONS: Multiple asthma medicines.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for a young adult of this age with a 10.5 Hertz, 50 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Brief stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K-complex, spindles and posts. Sleep is disrupted. Photic stimulation elicits driving. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 66-90 bpm, slightly irregular
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified in the record. The heart rate variability may be evaluated with different technologies.
