CLINICAL HISTORY: 33 year old right handed male status post resection of glioma
with past history of aphasia and hematoma.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Levetiracetam
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy
record. This was a 1 hour sleep deprived EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: On wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hertz alpha rhythm
identified bilaterally. There is a muscle artifact picked up with scalp electrode artifact at T3 almost continuously. There is also a bit of a breach with accentuation of beta
particularly in the frontal regions. In hyperventilation there is a bit of focal slowing
picked up primarily in the left parietal rhythm followed by rhythmic frontal theta.
Prolonged stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles. The patient's breach
rhythm is quite apparent there with higher amplitude activity in the left central region.
Photic stimulation produces scant bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:  1. Left parietal subtle focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The subtle left frontal features were not identified today. No epileptiform features were noted. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing may be of use, but in any case the most recent EEGs have been without
epileptiform activity.
