CLINICAL HISTORY:  40 year old right handed male with history of tonic clonic seizures and past medical history of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Lamictal, Keppra, Lisinopril.
REASON FOR EEG:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single electrode EKG.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz that is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta in overall diffuse low amplitude recording.  Sleep stage I and stage II was recorded. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  A prolonged recording may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
