CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed male with status epilepticus following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Left temporal focus noted in 2009.  Subsequent left sided focal slowing.  Admitted to the hospital in June 2012 after a tonic clonic seizure associated with thrombocytopenia, medication noncompliance, and alcohol abuse.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In hyperventilation, subtle underlying asymmetry is noted with a bit of underlying slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region.  Intermittent, left focal slowing is noted also on occasion in wakefulness and in the transition to drowsiness.  The slowing may be isolated theta, rare deltas, or even slowing of the faster frequency activity on the left. The patient drifts into deeper stages of sleep, but sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response.  The patient is drifting off into sleep during photic stimulation.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Subtle focal slowing in the left hemisphere, particularly the temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this individual.  In comparison to previous studies, which have been recorded in closer association to seizures, there are no sharp waves noted today and the focal slowing is less prominent.
