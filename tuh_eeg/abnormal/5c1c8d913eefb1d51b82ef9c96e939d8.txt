CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed woman with recurrent syncope, evaluate for seizures.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG demonstrates a well organized posterior dominant for 11 hertz, 60 microvolts with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity and frequent eye blinking. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, a little rhythmic theta and an increase in beta. Wicket Is Identified on rare occasions. Deep stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features. The vigorous photic driving response is a normal phenomenon in a healthy adult.
