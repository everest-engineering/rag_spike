CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old man with history of recent ischemic stroke and left sided weakness. He was found to have high grade ICA stenosis.

MEDICATIONS: Isoflurane, Propofol, SEVOFLURANE, Versed, Rocuronium, Lidocaine, Fentanyl, Neosynephrine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 6-7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Shifting slowing can be seen from either hemisphere. At times there is a bit more theta or delta on the left. There are also isolated bursts of delta on the right. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. A telephone produces electrical artifact in the scalp electrodes on the right.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing, sometimes slower on the right or left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No definitive epileptiform features were seen. The shifting slowing should be clinically correlated with imaging.
