CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old man with history of right temporal hemorrhages, hep C, seizures, presents with followup for seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen at times more diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in stage 1 sleep as well as wakefulness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 almost continuously at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts.  At one point, there was 1 sharply contoured transient, but not clearly epileptiform in the same region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is consistent with a known right temporal lobe hemorrhage.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
