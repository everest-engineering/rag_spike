CLINICAL HISTORY: 79 year old left handed male with new onset seizures, dementia.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Aricept, Namenda

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is a small amount
of temporal theta noted in wakefulness and in the transition to drowsiness.
Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits brief driving.

HR: 50 bpm and irregular

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no significant focal features observed. The
background is within normal limits for age. No epileptiform features were identified. If
epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study is suggested.
