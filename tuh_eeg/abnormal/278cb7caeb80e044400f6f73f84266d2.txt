CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with grade II glioma, language difficulties,
evaluate for epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic simulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG demonstrates
a prominent intrahemispheric asymmetry with prominent arrhythmic delta activity in the
left hemisphere and a prominent breach rhythm. The alpha rhythm is approximately 8
Hz bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. In this sharply
contoured record, there are a handful of suspicious sharp waves, particularly T1. Photic
stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left temporal focal slowing.
2. Rare left temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Compared to the previous studies,. this EEG is markedly
improved.
