CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old male who fell and hit his head November 2009 with an occipital skull fracture consequently developed loss of taste, loss of smell, impaired memory, headaches which are left frontal headaches and spreading to the occipital region, also paroxysmal dizziness, hypertension, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS: Xanax, Insulin and Seroquel,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes symmetric reactive alpha rhythm of 10 Hz and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Single electrode artifact is noted at T4 throughout the record. Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation significantly activate the record. Stage 1 sleep includes vertexes, K-complexes, spindles and posts.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified in this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
