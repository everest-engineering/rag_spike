REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  He is a 58-year-old man with history for the past 4 years.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient is currently on Dilantin and Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness, activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a diffuse excessive amount of beta activity throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.  Please note that the excessive beta may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.
