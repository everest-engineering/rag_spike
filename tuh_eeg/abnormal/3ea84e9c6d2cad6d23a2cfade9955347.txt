CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old male with encephalopathy and possible seizures, history of hypertension, heart failure, and ART.

MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Synthroid, Lipitor, Synthroid, KCL, Glyburide, Lopressor

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Central new activity is identified. There are occasional bursts of generalized delta and a handful of bursts which are a little asynchronous, more prominent from the left. The vast majority of the record, however, is well-organized. Features of drowsiness include slowing of the background with slow rolling eye movements.

HR: 96 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A handful of bursts of frontal delta and a handful of asymmetric bursts on the left seen in the initial portion of the record.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings on an adult of this age are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy.
