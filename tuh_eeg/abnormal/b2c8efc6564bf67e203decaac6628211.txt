CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 45-year-old woman with an ischemic stroke status post thrombolysis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and aphasia.
MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, lisinopril, Celexa, others
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11-Hz alpha rhythm.  Central mu activity at 9 Hz is identified.  Features of drowsiness include wicket followed by an increase in theta.  Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  Heart rate 66 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow-up study may be of value.
