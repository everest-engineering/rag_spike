CLINICAL: HISTORY: 52 year old right handed female with new onset seizures,
headaches, nausea and vomiting.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an
11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Photic
stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. Hyperventilation does not activate the
record.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration,
a followup study can be of use.
