CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 30-year-old woman who had seizures February 2012 and 05/19/2013.  The first seizure was related to alcohol ingestion but the second one was thought to be unrelated and was characterized by eye rolling, lifeless body, tongue biting and lasting 1 minute.  The patient abstinent for 4 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zoloft, Advair.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slower rolling eye movements with an increase in theta.  The patient seems to transition in and out of sleep state.  Hyperventilation was performed early on in the record.  The patient seemed to be a bit drowsy but hyperventilation did not otherwise activate the record.
Stage I sleep includes an increase in beta and POSTs.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  50 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
