CLINICAL HISTORY:  50 year old right handed male with history of aneurysm clipping with history of seizures.  She has been seizure free for 5 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol, Keppra, Tipramine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a background with absence of a clear posterior dominant rhythm and a very low amplitude voltage recording.  There is a preponderance of diffuse beta seen throughout the recording.  Otherwise there was normal sleep architecture seen in stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Some focal slow waves are noted at F3/C3 with some increase in faster frequencies at times in that region consistent with a breech.  The slow waves are noticed mainly at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal central slowing and breech.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left frontal central region which is consistent with the known surgery.  The absence of normal posterior dominant rhythm, although atypical, could be a normal variant.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
