CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old right handed woman admitted with status epilepticus on August 26, 2010, previous status epilepticus. The patient says that she knows when she is having a seizure, she will feel anxious and strange. She has a right occipital infarct and a possible AVM. Symptoms typically worsens when she stops taking her seizure medications. MRI shows right MTS.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm sometimes disrupted on the right. In addition, there is some focal slowing from the right hemisphere. In wakefulness there are high amplitude right anterior temporal spike and slow wave complexes and bursts and trains of right anterior temporal sharp waves. Testing is performed including a request for the patient to remember a word during one of these prolonged discharges, which is compatible with an electrographic seizure. The patient is able to remember a word during the discharge.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right temporal focal slowing.
2. Right temporal spike and slow wave complexes.
3. Bursts of right temporal sharp waves, which at least on 2 occasions are clearly compatible with a focal epileptiform seizure, but without clear clinical correlate.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The patient is more interactive with more eyes opening when she is not having the discharges. Alternative ways of evaluating the patient may include asking the patient to look at visual information rather than verbal memory which remained intact during these events.
