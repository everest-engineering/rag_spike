TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-formed posterior dominant rhythm at 9 to10 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  This is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontocentral beta is seen.  The EEG is only recorded during wakefulness.  Photic stimulation does not reveal any abnormal discharges.
