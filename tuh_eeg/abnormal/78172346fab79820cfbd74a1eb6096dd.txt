REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of body shaking.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 48-year-old woman with episodes of whole body shaking lasting half an hour to 2 hours for 1 year with no loss of consciousness or falls with bipolar anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.
MEDICATIONS:  Trazodone, Depakote, Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  Patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage 1, stage 2.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced abnormal discharges.
Heart Rate:  66.
Abnormal Discharges:  Focal slow waves seen rarely at T4.  One of them sharply contoured at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right midtemporal focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right midtemporal region, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
