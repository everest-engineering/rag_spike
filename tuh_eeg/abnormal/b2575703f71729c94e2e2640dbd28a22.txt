CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who was admitted for narcotic withdrawal and encephalopathy.
MEDICATIONS:
RECORDING TIMES:  The record starts at 10:29 a.m. It ends at 10:53 a.m.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  This is a bedside EEG recording.  As the record opens, there is a low voltage 10 to 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm that is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small to moderate amount of central theta activity that persists throughout the recording and is suggestive of background slowing.  Throughout the recording, there is a repetitive rhythmic eye blink eye movement abnormality noted in __________ that obscures much of the recording in that region.
At 10:43 a.m., the patient was noticed clinically to become agitated but there was no associated change in the background cerebral activity.
Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and did not induce a significant photic driving response.  There were no spikes or sharp waves identified.  There were no electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of diffuse bihemispheric mild slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Bihemispheric slowing may be seen in toxic metabolic encephalopathies or in diffuse underlying structural brain injury.  A single episode of agitation was not associated with any change in the background cerebellar EEG.
