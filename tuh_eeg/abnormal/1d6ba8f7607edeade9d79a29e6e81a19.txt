CLINICAL HISTORY:  CHF, CAD, recurrent syncope.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zoloft, Zocor, Ativan and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not possible. This is primarily an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Wakefulness demonstrates a low voltage pattern with generous muscle and true artifact and a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background.  Vertex waves were noted in sleep.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Low voltage pattern with slowing identified in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  Given the patient's recurrent syncopal spells and fall with injury, long-term monitoring was initiated.
