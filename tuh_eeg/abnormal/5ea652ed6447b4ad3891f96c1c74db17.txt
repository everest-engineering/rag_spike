CLINICAL HISTORY: A 28-yea -old woman with numbness of the right face and head, lasting for 2-3 days. Symptoms occurred 1 week ago and previously 2 years ago. Evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed. This is a technically acceptable EEG aside from the T1-2 electrodes.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with an increase In beta and then rare vertex waves and K complexes.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produced bursts of relatively synchronous bilateral slowing.
Heart rate 66 bpm. slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits in wakefulness and early sleep.
CLINICAL No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the record. If epilepsy is an Important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered.
