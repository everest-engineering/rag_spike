CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old woman with a 4 cm posterior fossa hematoma and altered mentation.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Percocet, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern with a mixture of theta and delta. The overall activity is relatively rhythmic and includes approximately 1 Hz delta, 3.5 Hz delta, and 4.5 Hz activity. In addition, there is some eye movement but there is also a subtle, right frontal sharp wave noted. FIRDA is also observed and is present bilaterally. Stimulation of the patient seems to produce more of a theta pattern than the frontal delta. Vigorous stimulation is not performed.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to.
1. Replacement of normal background with the pattern of rhythmic slowing.
2. Right frontal sharp waves.
3. Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings may be correlated with imaging and clinical history. This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function in that there are frontal sharp waves, additional recording may be appropriate.
