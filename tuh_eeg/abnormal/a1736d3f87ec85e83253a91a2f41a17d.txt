CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old ambidextrous female with recurrent seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Zoloft, Lovenox, Keppra, Topamax, Labetalol, Protonix
Carbamazepine.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates more of a rhythmic beta frequency pattern. The overall mixture is primarily rhythmic, 3 to 5 Hz activity. There are some sharp waves noted including some tiny discreet ones at T4, larger ones at T2, and then at F7. The technologist notes that the patient is not verbally responsive. She starts to drift off to sleep with an increase in beta and one or two vertex waves followed by arousals. The sharp waves are noted in the right frontal region but they are lower voltage.

HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A pattern of generalized slowing.
2. Occasional discreet temporal sharp waves, identified independently from right or left.
CLINICAL This EEG is relatively improved compared to many of the studies for this patient. No seizures were recorded. Other possible contributing factors for her mental status should be considered today in that epileptiform activity is not so prominent.
