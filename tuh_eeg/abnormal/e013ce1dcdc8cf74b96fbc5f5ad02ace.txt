CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old gentleman with acute subdural hematoma on Sunday status post evacuation on Sunday night. Previous bilateral subdural hematomas and left MCA infarct.
MEDICATIONS: Phenytoin, Senna, Simvastatin, Keppra, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly asymmetric.
There is interhemispheric asymmetry. The amplitude is low. There is left sided delta waves present, as well as right sided delta and theta waves present. There is rare, sharply contouring slowing on the right side. Stimulation of the patient does not significantly activate the record. The background occasionally attenuates.
HR: 114 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked slowing from the left side.
2. There is slow pattern on the right.
3. There is occasional attenuation of the background.
4. There is occasional sharp contoured delta on the right side.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is similar to previous studies. There were no seizures seen. It is somewhat slower than the previous study.
