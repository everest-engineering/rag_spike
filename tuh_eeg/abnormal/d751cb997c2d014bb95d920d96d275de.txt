LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 52-year-old man with seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Seroquel, carvedilol, metformin, oxycodone.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm reaches 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Throughout the majority of the recording the patient is asleep.  POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal, mostly asleep, briefly awake, 21-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
