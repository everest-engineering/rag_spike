CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old right handed man with a history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, CAD, CHF and prostate cancer, recently admitted for weakness, diaphoresis, near syncope, and possible seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Zosyn, Acetaminophen, ASA, Atorvastatin, Protonix, Ditropan, Heparin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while poorly responsive.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation. No normal sleep architecture was clearly seen.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded while poorly responsive.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  During the recording at times there is some intermittent transient bursts of faster frequencies in the theta range that seem to be related to stimulation.  We did perform photic stimulation which revealed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing with some good activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  The good reactivity suggested maybe due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
