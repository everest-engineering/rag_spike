CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 54-year-old woman with migraine headaches, depression and intermittent hand shaking lasting 5 minutes in duration.  This occurs 4 to 5 times per week, followed by generalized pain and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Risperidone, Effexor, Ativan, Lidoderm, Reglan, Pentazocine, Maxalt, many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient seemed to be very uncomfortable during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the overall EEG includes a low voltage pattern with generous beta and scant, 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by a generalized beta pattern followed by theta.  Even when the patient is becoming drowsy, there is a great deal of muscle artifact noted.
Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response bilaterally.  Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Within normal limits this was technically somewhat a challenging EEG in what appeared to be an anxious individual.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  The generous beta may be due to this patient's medications.
