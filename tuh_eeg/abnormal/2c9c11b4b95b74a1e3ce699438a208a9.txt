CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed man that presents with episodes of loss of consciousness described as blacking out from side to side, then loss of consciousness.  Then he was out for minutes and was very confused afterwards.  The last episode was September 29, 2011.  He denies any head trauma or seizure history in the family.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Activating procedures with hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm at 20-60 mV amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  Normal frontal central beta is seen. Sleep is characterized by stage I. Stimulation and hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Note:  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Repeated recording or a more prolonged recording may notice epileptiform discharges.
