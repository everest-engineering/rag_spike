CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old right handed woman with cramps in her head and convulsions in her body. Hypertension, irregular heart rate, osteoporosis, epilepsy, difficulty walking. Seizures started 7 years ago and are associated with severe pain. Diabetes and renal disease.
MEDICATIONS: Carvedilol, Lovastatin, Calcium, Imitrex, Fosamax.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8.7 hertz alpha rhythm. The patient is shifting about frequently. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing and there is a handful of bursts of shifting slowing. POSTS are noted as the patient drifts off to sleep. Spindles and vertex waves are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient drifts in and out of stage II sleep. No significant driving response is noted. POSTS are high amplitude and broad for this individual.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Occasional bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. This shifting slowing in early drowsiness in an adult of this age is of unclear clinical significance. It may represent underlying cerebrovascular disease or medication effect. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.
