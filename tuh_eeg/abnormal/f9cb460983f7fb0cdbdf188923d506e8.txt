LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of migraines for the last 4 to 5 months associated with left facial twisting when the headaches occur.  This lasts only seconds but facial tingling and pain lasts for several days thereafter.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include tramadol, __________, Tylenol with codeine.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  No normal sleep architecture is captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate is captured on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake only 21 minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
