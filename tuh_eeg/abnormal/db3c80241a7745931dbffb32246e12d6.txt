CLINICAL HISTORY:  24 year old left handed woman with bipolar disorder, hyperprolactinemia, pituitary adenoma, hyperlipidemia.  Epilepsy, not otherwise described.  Born in a homeless shelter in 1987.  Prenatal drug exposure.  Developmental delay.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Dilantin, Zocor, Seroquel, Lamictal, Cogentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is excess theta noted in the background.  In the transition to sleep there is some 6 Hz theta activity which demonstrates a small amount of shifting asymmetry.  Brief vertex waves are noted in sleep, but sleep is not sustained. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is in a drowsy state and does not elicit a driving response.
HR:    86 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
A small amount of background theta.
A somewhat disorganized background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are some normal variants noted in the EEG, including some of the theta activity described above.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
