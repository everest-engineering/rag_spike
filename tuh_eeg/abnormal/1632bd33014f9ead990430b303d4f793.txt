CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with epilepsy.  The patient had reduced her Keppra during pregnancy and subsequently had a break through seizure, which she describes as 30 minutes of staring without loss of consciousness.  Previous EEG results N/A.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, attenuation of alpha, and some hypersynchronous volume.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
