CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed male with epilepsy, tonic clonic seizures, post-ictal incontinence.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Ativan

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is excessively drowsy and there is a great difficulty keeping the patient awake.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is resting comfortably, there is a more pattern of diffuse beta. Features of stage 2 sleep include vertex waves and spindles. There is an artifact picked up intermittently in the record. It looks like IV drip artifact, but it is picked up in the eye movements and it confounds some of the activity seen in the left temporal region. Hyperventilation is attempted unsuccessfully because of the patient's drowsiness. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's excessive drowsiness may be explained by his medications. To differentiate between a small, discreet sharp wave in the left frontal/frontal temporal region, a follow up tracing when he is a bit more cooperative is suggested.
