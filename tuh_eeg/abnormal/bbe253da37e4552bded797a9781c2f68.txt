CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 22-year-old woman with epilepsy, recent prolonged seizure with loss of awareness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  Posterior slow waves of youth were observed.  Drowsiness is characterized by hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.
Hyperventilation was performed with good effort producing an increasing an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
A single left temporal sharp wave was noted in early drowsiness.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A single left temporal sharp wave cannot be considered pathological and must be considered artifact.
This is the third EEG for this patient in 4 years.  At age 18 she had 3 Hz spike and wave activity, but this has not been seen in the more recent studies.
