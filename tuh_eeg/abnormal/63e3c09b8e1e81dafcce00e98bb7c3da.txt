CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed woman status post right
endarterectomy followed by hematoma. unresponsiveness, and two seizures during
attempts to reintubate. Past history of right ACA and MCA in hypertension, CLL,
COPD.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Lasix, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. patient is awake and
responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates 9 Hz alpha rhythm on the
left. The overall pattern from the left is relatively unremarkable There is a small amount
of theta noted in the background and a small amount of shifting theta. In this bedside
portable ICU record, there is both some artifact on the right a d occasional focal delta
noted from the right hemisphere, particularly in the posterior quadrant. These findings
abate as the patient is stimulated or awakens.
HR: 96bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, bilateral slowing with theta activity.
2. Occasional right focal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features noted. The
intermittent, right focal slowing may be correlated with a or functional process
on the right.
