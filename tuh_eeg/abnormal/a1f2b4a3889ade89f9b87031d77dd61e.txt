CLINICAL HISTORY: 80 year old male with focal seizures characterized by right arm jerking after right frontal stroke. Seizures were characterized by continuous right arm jerking in the context of a tiny right frontal stroke. Initial EEG demonstrated left frontal focal slowing, but no sharp waves.
MEDICATIONS: Klonopin, Keppra, Lovenox, Hydralazine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is very drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: When the patient is maximally stimulated, there is a well-defined 9 Hz alpha rhythm. The patient drifts off to sleep with rhythmic background slowing and occasional bursts of shifting slowing. He is following asleep during stimulation, at which point vertex waves start to emerge. Scant driving response is noted.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no epileptiform features observed today. There are no focal seizures. The patient seems to be drowsier than previous studies.
