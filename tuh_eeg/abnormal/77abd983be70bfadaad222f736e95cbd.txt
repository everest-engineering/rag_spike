CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old right handed female with recurrent refractory status
epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Decadron, Lamotrigine, Clonidine, Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to demonstrate a
high amplitude right occipital spike and slow wave complex, which involves 02, T6, and
sometimes T4 and C4. This activity does evolve. At times there is an alpha rhythm
identified from the left. The high amplitude epileptiform activity can spread to the left
occipital region and is associated with significant arrhythmic delta. Photic stimulation is
performed while the epileptiform activity marches through and does not so clearly
activate the record. At the end of the record the EEG activity continues to wax and
wane, suggesting an ongoing ictal pattern.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continued electrographic focal status epilepticus.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This pattern suggests an ongoing epileptiform process.
The activity clearly demonstrates frequency of evolution and cannot be considered a
postictal pattern.
