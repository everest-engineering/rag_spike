HISTORY: 58 year old gentleman with learning disability, mute, with new
onset seizures.
Keppra, Norvasc, Namenda, Seroquel, Prilosec, ASA, Cymbalta,
Senna
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a very low
voltage pattern with some prominent, diffuse 5Hz theta activity. Lambda waves are
identified in wakefulness. On occasion there is a suggestion of a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.
Brief drowsiness is characterized by a decrease in eye blinking and an increase in beta.
Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 40-60 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess theta.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features were identified, however, this is
an awake record. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study capturing
sleep may be of value. Additional evaluation the patient's irregular bradycardic heart
rate may be important.
