CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old male with a nocturnal seizure. Lupus anticoagulant. History of pneumonia. The tech reports that the patient has had a nocturnal seizure in 08/2010.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Protonics, Toprol, Prednisone, CellCept, ASA, Nexium, Bactrim
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized. There is a electrode artifact picked up in the T3 electrode throughout. There is a 9.7 Hertz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background. Hyperventilation produces electrode artifact. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the temporal electrode artifact, there were no focal neuro epileptiform features observed in this EEG. This EEG is similar to a previous EEG 01/2009.
