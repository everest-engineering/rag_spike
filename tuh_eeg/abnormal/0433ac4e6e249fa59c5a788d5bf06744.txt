CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old right handed male with epilepsy, hepatitis C and liver
disease admitted after multiple seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
performed. The patient had one of his spells during the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with
occasional background theta particularly in the temporal regions. Hyperventilation is performed
early-on in the record producing an increase in generalized slowing. This is follow by
drowsiness with increased rhythmic slowing followed by vertex waves, K complexes, spindles
and then arousals.
At 11:59, the patient is awake. He shifts about. He is awake during photic stimulation which
elicits a brief driving response.
The patient has a spell during the EEG. This is at 12:10. at 12:10:56, he is moving about. He is
unresponsive with a technician. During the section at 12:10:52, the patient has right facial
twitching and he has some movements of his left arm. He does not answer questions to the
technologist. The patient is not entirely on camera. The EEG demonstrates an awake pattern
with an artifact at C3T3. He is amnestic for the event. Unfortunately during this spell the
technician is trying to repair the C3 electrode. He is described as having alternating right facial
or left hand movements. There is no definitive EEG signature for these behaviors.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits but with unusual behavior.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the electrode problems, there was no EEG scalp
signature for this patient's behavior.
