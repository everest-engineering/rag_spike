CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed female with right-sided numbness, migraine headaches, pelvic surgery, past history of seizure associated with hypoglycemia.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a vigorous, 11 Hz alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts. There is generous beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing an increase in theta in the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 60bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are seen. The generous beta can be seen in the context of anxiety or medication effects. In this individual with focal neurologic features, correlation with imaging is suggested.
