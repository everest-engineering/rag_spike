LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 65-year-old woman with past medical history of diabetes, hypertension and new onset seizure on 09/25/2012.  Seizure was described as loss of consciousness followed by a generalized tonic clonic convulsion.
MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol, lisinopril, lovastatin, metformin, ranitidine, Advair, Lantus.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm reaches 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Intermittent bursts of polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the right temporal region.  Intermittently this slowing is rhythmic in the delta range (TIRDA; temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity).  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving that is better pronounced over the left.
FINDINGS:
Intermittent mild to moderate left temporal slowing.
TIRDA (temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 22 minute awake and asleep EEG due to intermittent mild to moderate right temporal slowing that is often rhythmic.  This finding indicates focal right temporal dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  Finding of rhythmic activity over the right temporal region may indicate potential epileptogenic focus over that region.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured.  The lack of
epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
