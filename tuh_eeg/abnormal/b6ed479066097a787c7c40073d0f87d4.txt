CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed male with right-handed weakness, right-sided facial tingling with headaches.

MEDICATIONS: Neurontin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background followed by the appearance of drowsiness with vertex waves, K complex, spindles and POSTS in stage 2 sleep. The POSTS are more prominent on the left than the right. Photic is performed while the patient is in stage 2 sleep.

HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.  CLINICAL CORRELATION: Asymmetric POSTS are not a pathological finding. Additional EEG recording will be undertaken to characterize this individual's epilepsy.
