CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old male with right parietal headache, alcohol cocaine abuse, epilepsy and hypertensive emergency. Past EEG Digitrace EEG evaluation for paroxysmal dizziness.

MEDICATIONS: Haldol, Ativan, ASA, Heparin, Zocor, Hydralazine, Clonidine, Isosorbide, Lasix, ferrous Sulfate, Senna, Amlodipine, Phoslo, Lorazepam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is primarily drowsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In drowsy EEG, the background includes primarily a theta frequency pattern. Despite the artifacts, once again independent right or left anterior temporal sharp waves are identified at one point relatively frequent on the right but clearly bilateral. Features of drowsiness are as described above with an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation seems to elicit a driving response and unfortunately there is a great deal of artifact in the record:

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Independent, right or left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: Despite the problems with the record described above, the sharp waves can clearly be differentiated from artifacts. They are more prominent on the right today, but were previously identified form both right and left.
