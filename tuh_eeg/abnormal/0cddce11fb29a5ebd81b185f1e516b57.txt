CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed woman with epilepsy, seizure-free for
the last 2 months.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Diovan, Carbamazepine, Ranitidine, Dexilant, Carafate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 30 microvolt
posterior dominant rhythm there is an amplitude asymmetry of higher amplitude activity
on the left compared to the right. In addition to wicket activity, there are bursts of
paroxysmal left temporal somewhat irregular slowing. These bursts are accentuated by
hyperventilation. Features of drowsiness include some synchronous, hypersynchronous
rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces
the most prominent left temporal features with a rhythmic slowing and sharply contoured
slowing.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A asymmetry with higher amplitude activity on the left.
2. Rhythmic paroxysmal slowing from the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No left temporal sharp waves were identified in this
record. The focal features on the left have been previously identified and support a focal
mechanism for seizures.
