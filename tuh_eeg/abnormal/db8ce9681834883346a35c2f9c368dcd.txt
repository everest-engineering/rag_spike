CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 74-year-old woman with seizures following a medical illness and missing her gabapentin.  Currently event free, but with numbness and tremor in the left arm.  Keppra taper in progress.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin, Keppra, Synthroid and many others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  This is a routine EEG with satisfactory impedances aside from the T1-T2 electrode.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, which is somewhat disrupted on the right compared to the left.  There are bursts of bilateral, relatively rhythmic slowing.  In addition, there is shifting slowing, more so on the right compared to the left.  Features of drowsiness include a decrease in muscle.  In addition, focal slowing from the right becomes a bit more prominent as the patient transitions in and out of drowsiness.  The focal slowing on the right is intermittent.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was relatively drowsy and did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to.
Focal slowing from the right hemisphere with disruption of faster frequency activity and intermittent disruption of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing.
Occasional bursts of bilateral slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the fourth EEG for this individual.  No epileptiform features have been seen in this EEG or the two previous EEGs.  The focal slowing on the right is ipsilateral to the
patient's stroke.  Of note, the last two EEGs have shown a bit more in the way of generalized features including generalized slowing or shifting slowing.
