CLINICAL HISTORY: 74 year old woman with acute hyponatremia and a total of 5 tonic-clonic seizures on the 18th.
MEDICATIONS: Azithromycin, Levothyroxine, Premarin, Levaquin, Lovenox, Pantoprazole, Flagyl
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is intermittent, generalized slowing and occasional left temporal focal slowing. The alpha rhythm reaches 10Hz but at times is somewhat slower. Features of drowsiness include vertex waves and spindles.
HR: 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. These findings may be correlated with imaging but in an adult of this age can be seen in underlying cerebrovascular disease.
