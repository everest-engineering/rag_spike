CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed female with refractory epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Zonegran, Keppra, Vimpat; HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9. 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm
with a generous amount or low voltage frontocentral beta activity. produces a bit of rhythmic temporal slowing. Photic stimulation does elicit scant driving despite artifacts. Following this, the patient becomes somewhat drowsy with some shifting temporal slowing, a bit more so on the left although the right is a bit more obscured by artifact. Underneath the artifact there appears to be a left temporal sharp wave in the drowsy record. In addition, although high frequency filler of 35 is employed all the way through even into the sleep record, there does seem to be some shifting temporal slowing. There is a fair amount of muscle and movement artifact noted in the background.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
1. A mild degree or background disorganization, particularly in the initial section of the record.
2. Some shifting temporal slowing With suspicious left anterior temporal sharp waves noted in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy.
Right and left temporal focal features have been identified in the past. The technical limitations of this record may limit the ability to more clearly define sharp waves.
