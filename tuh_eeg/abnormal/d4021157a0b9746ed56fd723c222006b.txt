INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11.5 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness and hyperventilation both produce a small amount of rhythmic frontal theta. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is becoming somewhat drowsy, but does not activate the record.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
