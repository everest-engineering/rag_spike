CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed woman with migraine headaches, vomiting and a history of postpartum heart failure following delivery of a stillbirth infant. Left middle cerebral artery stenosis.
MEDICATIONS: Butalbital, Clonazepam, Celexa, Citalopram, Fexofenadine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is asleep during photic stimulation.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 12Hz alpha rhythm with generous, low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta with vertex waves, spindles and posts in stage II sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The generous beta identified in this record may be due to the use of benzodiazepines. No epileptiform features were noted.
