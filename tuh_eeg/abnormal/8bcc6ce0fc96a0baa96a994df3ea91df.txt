CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old male with history of severe headache, confusion and change in mental status as well as right intracerebral hemorrhage with internal jugular extension, hypertension, syncope, headache, diabetes.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best wakefulness reaches 6 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontocentral beta.  Overall the patient is mainly recorded during sleep but during the limited wakefulness appears to be extensive theta.  No activating procedures were performed and clear staged changes were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T4 intermittently at a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen during wakefulness and at times with frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to a right mid temporal focal slowing as well as generalized slowing of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA).
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right mid temporal region, which is consistent with a known hemorrhage.  In addition, there is evidence of moderate to diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology and may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
