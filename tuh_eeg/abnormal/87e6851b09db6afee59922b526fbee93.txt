TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous T3 electrode artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, and stage I and stage II.

Heart rate 66.
