CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 68-year-old woman with limited history, resident of the South. She reports having epilepsy and multiple falls with multiple medical problems. Long history of epilepsy but recently improved and her falling stopped.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Lipitor, Norvasc, Detrol, others.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Photic simulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominate rhythm. A fair amount of muscle artifact, and a very modest beta. The patient appears to be nervous as indicated by frequent eye flutter. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Heart rate 96 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits, but is remarkable for;
1. Generous beta.
2. Eye flutter.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The features described above can be seen in the context of anxiety. The beta may be seen with the use of benzodiazepine. No epileptiform features were identified today. A follow up study may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
