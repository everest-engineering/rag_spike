CLINICAL HISTORY: 	42 year old left-handed male with asthma and staring spells. MEDICATIONS: Advair.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard  10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:   In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz 40-mcv alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing. Stage 1 and stage 2 sleep followed with vertex waves,  POSTS, and K complexes. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.
HR:	72  bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:	No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If this patient has frequent staring spells, and outpatient ambulatory record capturing his behaviors may be useful.
