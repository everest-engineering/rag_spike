HISTORY: A 45 year old woman with epilepsy at least since 2008, occipital lobe epilepsy. history of pancreatitis. Previously treated with Topamax and Depakote. Multiple previous evaluations for repetitive occipital lobe seizures and previous EEG monitoring.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In the Jab using standard 10Â·20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This Is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness. there Is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but at times this Is clearly disrupted in the right occipital region compared to the left. As the patient becomes drowsy, in addition, there Is subtle focal rhythmic 3-4 Hz activity in the right posterior quadrant, which Is brief. not sustained.
Photic stimulation is obscured by muscle artifact, but no significant driving was identified.
Hyperventilation produces an increase In amplitude and subtly accentuates the asymmetry between the 2 temporal regions and the 2 occipital regions. Heart rate 96 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG due to: Focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant characterized by disruption of the alpha rhythm in wakefulness and rare focal slowing in drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified in this EEG. This pattern is improved compared to previous studies, which have demonstrated occipital sharp waves, spikes, and occipital seizures.
