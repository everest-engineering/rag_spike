CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old woman with severe life stress, migraine headaches, blackout spells.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a generous amount of beta with a 11 Hertz alpha rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta as well as some rhythmic theta. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features identified. The generous beta could be due to anxiety, normal variant or medications.
