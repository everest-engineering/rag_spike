CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old right handed male with seizure disorder, who has been seizure free for months.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Loss of A2 electrode at the end of the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient goes into stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   None.
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Repeat recording may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.
