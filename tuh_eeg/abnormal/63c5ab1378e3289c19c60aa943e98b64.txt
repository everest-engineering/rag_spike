CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed female with recurrent seizures, 2 in February.  Three seizures per week.  Lost her insurance and was not able to go back to the Neurology Clinic.  Past history of stroke with left-sided weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Zocor, Celexa, Iron, Aggrenox, ASA, Valium
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.   Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9-Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a small amount of subtle theta and a very subtle asymmetry in the left temporal region relative to the right temporal region.  Hyperventilation does not activate the record.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Photic stimulation elicits a very subtle bilateral driving response at faster frequencies.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal for an adult of this age due to:
Very subtle underlying slowing in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  Epileptiform activity has not been identified for this individual since 2006.  In an adult of this age, the findings
described above are nonspecific and can be seen in the context of underlying cerebrovascular disease or with a history of lupus cerebritis or other CNS process.
