CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old male with left-sided stroke with right-sided weakness
and a seizure January 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in Jab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed.
This is an awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed today. To more
completely characterize this individual's epilepsy, comparison with the previous 2005
EEG or a repeat study capturing in sleep is suggested.
