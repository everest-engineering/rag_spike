RECORDING LENGTH:  41 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizure onset at the age of 15.  She has been seizure free for approximately 5 years, but she started having seizures again in June of 2012.  She had an episode concerning for seizure today.  Episode was described as trouble completing her thoughts, some stuttering, and sharp pain in her head.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra and birth control pill.  In the emergency room she was given Ativan, Keppra, and Toradol.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to a standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Both hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta activity is present throughout the recording.  During sleep, symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindle, and POSTS (posterior occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A regular heart rate with occasional premature atrial QRS complexes captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 41-minute electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on routine electroencephalogram does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to the medication affect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  These findings were conveyed to the ordering physician at the time of this dictation.
