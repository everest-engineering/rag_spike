INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There are episodes of shifting slowing bilaterally. First it slows on the right but later in the record she has bursts of delta on the left as well. There are first bursts of slowing theta as well as bilateral delta. The record is also
disorganized. She does reach an alpha rhythm of 9Hz but this is amidst otherwise, slow disorganized EEG.
HR:	84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Moderately abnormal EEG due to:
1. 	Shifting slowing of delta waves bilaterally.
2. 	Disorganized and slow background.
3.	No sharps or spikes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:   These findings are nonspecific and can represent either stigmata of ischemic cerebrovascular disease or a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.  A
repeat EEG can be performed as warranted.
