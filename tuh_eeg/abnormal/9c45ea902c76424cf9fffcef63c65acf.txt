CLINICAL HISTORY: 30 year old right handed gentleman with 12 seizures per month.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Lamictal, Vim pat

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized for
an adult of this age with a glimpse of a 7 hertz posterior dominant rhythm. There is
prominent epileptiform activity in the occipital region, right greater than left. In addition, there are occasional focal sharp waves at T6or right frontal or left anterior temporal. Photic stimulation does appear to accentuate some of the posterior epileptiform activity. In addition, there is some left frontocentral spike activity which also seems to be slightly accentuated, but there are no prolonged discharges. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude with a background.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Prominent occipital epileptiform activities.
3. Multifocal spikes.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to other studies, there is less epileptiform
activity noted today. No seizures were recorded.
