CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old woman with an episode of memory loss on January 5 lasting 30 minutes.  She had an amnestic spell while in a bank.  Since this time she has had intermittent right eye twitching.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and an increase in beta.
Brief stage 2 sleep includes  vertex waves and K-complexes and POSTS.  The patient was falling asleep during photic stimulation, but a driving response was elicited.
Heart rate:  60 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Generous beta activity is noted, and there is a suggestion of an   alpha supra-harmonic.  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  The beta activity described above can be seen in the context of anxiety, but an alpha supra-harmonic could also account for this.  The frequent eye blinking is sometimes a sign of nervousness.
