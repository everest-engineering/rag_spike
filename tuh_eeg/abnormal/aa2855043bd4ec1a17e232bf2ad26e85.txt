CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old male with history of seizures. Evaluate post Code for anoxic encephalopathy; date of anoxia not recorded.

MEDICATIONS: Phenobarbital, Dilantin, Depakote, Valproate Acid, Zosyn, Midazolam, Amiodarone, Dopamine, Norepinephrine, Dobutamine, Vasopressin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. This was a 4-hour EEG study.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage pattern with intermittent theta and scant amounts of delta. Muscle artifact is observed. No myoclonus is noted. Occasional very subtle frontal sharp wave contoured theta waves are observed. As the muscle artifact drops out in the background, a discontinuous pattern is observed.

HR: 120 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background with a pattern of relatively invariant, arrhythmic theta delta.
2. Intermittent discontinuity.
3. Absence of reactivity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This tracing demonstrates some positive but some negative findings for a patient status post significant anoxic injury. To put this in appropriate clinical context, the day of the anoxic injury should be documented. No epileptiform features were observed and no clinical seizures were noted. Of note, the background demonstrates less muscle and more discontinuity in the later portions of this 4-hour, critical care bedside recording.
