CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 44-year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy since 18 months of age. The patient reports grand mal, petite mal and complex partial seizures.  The seizures occur during sleep, the last seizure was 10 days ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin, Provera, Excedrin, ibuprofen, Dulera, may others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz 40 microvolt alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Prominent mu activity is noted with 8 Hz activity in the central regions particularly on the left although testing was not performed to confirm this.  Mu rhythm was also noted in the right central region as the recording continued.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  The overall EEG is relatively high voltage with a very prominent mu activity.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Drowsiness produces an increase in beta.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.  In some sections of the record there is a question of an alpha sub-harmonic.
Heart rate 72 b.p.m.
IMPRESSION:  This is an interesting but normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This patient has an interesting but normal EEG including the mu activity and the alpha rhythm with the alpha supra-harmonic.  No epileptiform features were identified.  If additional information is needed to characterize this individual's epilepsy, a more prolonged study can be considered.  Although benzodiazepines were not listed in this patient's medications, benzodiazepines or other similar medications might account for the prominent beta noted in the record.
