Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, symmetric
reactive alpha rhythm. Alpha squeak is identified. There is a subtle driving response
noted in photic stimulation. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in theta.
Hyperventilation produces a small increase in amplitude of the background.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL There are no epileptiform features noted. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is
suggested.
