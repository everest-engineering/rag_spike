CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old female with past medical history of childhood epilepsy, HIV, breast cancer, PCP use, uterine fibroid, depression, who presents with generalized tonic clonic seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Asentra, sertraline, Truvada.
REASON FOR STUDY: History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10â•–20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and KG electrodes. Wakefulness and sleep was recorded. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. Continuous F7 electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with amplitude of 20-66 mv, which is reactive to eye opening. Normal frontal central beta is seen. Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II. Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation, did not reveal any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: None.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Normal awake and sleep EEG. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. Note: A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Prolonged recording with capturing deep stages sleep may aid in eliciting epileptiform discharges.
