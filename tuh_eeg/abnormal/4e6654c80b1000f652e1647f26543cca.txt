CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 33-year-old, right-handed female with new onset seizures since May 2012, during sleep with tongue biting and postictal confusion.  Her last seizure was in September 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the laboratory using the standard International 10-20 System of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring, hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10-11 Hz in frequency, 70-75 microvolts in amplitudes seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed and multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 60 to 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
