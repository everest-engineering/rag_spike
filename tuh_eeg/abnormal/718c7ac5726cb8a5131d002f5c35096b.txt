CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old male status post assault yesterday with decompressive craniotomy and external ventricular drain placed.  There were diffuse contusions. No bone flap on the left and had seizures on 03/22/2012 and presents today on May 25 with change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during lethargy.  No photic activation procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that in the left hemisphere reaches 7 Hz and is not very well see in the right hemisphere.  There is no normal sleep architecture.  No photic activation procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T3-T4/C3 continuously at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts and an associated breach over that region.  In addition, there is intermittent FA4/F4 slowing at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts seen continuously without significant breach is seen.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left central temporal slowing.
Right frontotemporal slowing and right frontal slowing.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left central temporal as well as right focal cerebellar dysfunction, which is consistent with the known injury.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction which is not specific with the known injury.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.
