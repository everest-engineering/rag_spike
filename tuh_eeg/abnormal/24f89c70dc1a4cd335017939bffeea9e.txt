REASON FOR STUDY:  Dizziness and passing out.
STAGES:  Awake and drowsy.
ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:  Photic stimulation was performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49 -year-old male with a complaint of dizziness and episodes of passing out.  Per patient, questionable brain mass.  Past medical history of hydrocephalus, renal problems, orthostatic hypotension, diabetes and FSGS.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Lexapro, pioglitazone.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  There was a T3 electrode dislodgement artifact which was fixed.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz alpha at 9 to 10 Hz frequency and 30 to 50 microvolts in amplitude.  The posterior dominant rhythm is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a good anteroposterior gradient with normal beta.
Sleep:  The patient achieved drowsiness during the record which was characterized by anterior spread of alpha and occasional vertex spikes.
There was 1 asymmetry vertex wave seen on the left hemisphere.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Photic stimulation was performed which produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This a normal EEG. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
