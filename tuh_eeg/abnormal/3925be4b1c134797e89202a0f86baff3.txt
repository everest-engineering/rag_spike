REASON:  Evaluate for encephalopathy.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old woman with previous left MCA CVA, MR, CHF, and CAD.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is routine 24 minute  EEG which is technically acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm which is disrupted on the right compared to the left.  The right hemisphere demonstrates nearly continuous focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity and a mixture of arrhythmic delta and theta.  The focal slowing is of medium amplitude.  Features of drowsiness include bilateral slowing, but the asymmetry persists into stage 1 sleep.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous right-sided focal slowing with disruption of faster frequency activity and slow activity.
No epileptiform features were identified.
Clinical Correlation
This EEG is more supportive of a structural process on the right than the left as described in the Tech history.
