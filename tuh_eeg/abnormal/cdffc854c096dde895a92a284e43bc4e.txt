CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 60-year-old gentleman seizures free for 18 years until a tonic clonic seizure 2 weeks ago with postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This as an awake and asleep record.  We did not do hyperventilation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a relatively low voltage EEG.  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact in maximal wakefulness.  Slightly asymmetric vertex waves are noted in stage I sleep.  Other features of sleep include vertex waves and brief spindles in stage II sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate 60-84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
