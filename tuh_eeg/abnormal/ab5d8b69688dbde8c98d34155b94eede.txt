CLINICAL HISTORY:  36 year old right handed man with an episode of dizziness and loss of consciousness associated with left back weakness and headache for the past 3 months.
MEDICATIONS:  Prilosec
REASON FOR STUDY:  Headache and weakness on the left side.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges including photic stimulation and hyperventilation.  Some times during the recording the patient becomes drowsy and there are some sharply contoured central discharges, not clearly epileptiform, specifically in the left central and right central regions.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
