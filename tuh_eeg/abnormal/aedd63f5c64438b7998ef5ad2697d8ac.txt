CLINICAL HISTORY:  64 year old woman with CKD, hypertension, anemia, hyperlipidemia and diabetes with 1 week of full body twitching.
MEDICATIONS:  None reported
REASON FOR STUDY:  Patient with body twitching.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video  EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal, single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is an increased amount of beta frequency seen diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T3 and F8/T4 independently throughout the recording at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 microvolts.  At times, there are some sharply contoured waveforms in the left temporal region which are more consistent with wickets, not clearly epileptiform.
At times during wakefulness, there appears to be excessive theta seen throughout the recording at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
Mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal region as well as mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
