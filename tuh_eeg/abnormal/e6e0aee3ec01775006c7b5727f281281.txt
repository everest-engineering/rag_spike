CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed male who had a seizure. after
meningioma or MVA in 2005, currently seizure free for the last 5 years but with ataxia.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Nifedipine, Ranitidine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hertz alpha rhythm
which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of low voltage
frontal central beta activity. Stage 2 sleep includes vertex, K complexes, spindles and
posts. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as
providing some theta. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting in and
out of sleep but there is a driving response.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
