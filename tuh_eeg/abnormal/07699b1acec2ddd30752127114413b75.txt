CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right handed woman with refractory epilepsy, admitted with recurrent seizures. Also history of depression.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Keppra, Ambien

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.3 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm which is much more prominent on the left in comparison to the right. Intermittently, there is background bilateral theta but the most striking characteristics are prominent disruption of faster frequency activity from the right hemisphere. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing rhythmic, sharply contoured 3-4 Hertz activity maximum at T2. Vertex waves are noted as the patient becomes drowsy following hyperventilation. There are a handful of sharp waves or sharply contoured slowing. Photic stimulation elicits an asymmetric driving response better identified on the left.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the right hemisphere characterized by rhythmic slowing and disruption of faster frequency activity.
2. Rare sharply contoured slowing from the right.
3. Asymmetric photic driving

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a previous EEG and support a right temporal lobe focus for her epilepsy.
