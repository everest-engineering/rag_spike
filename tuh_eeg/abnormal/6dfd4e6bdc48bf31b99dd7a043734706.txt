CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old male with first ever seizure 2/20/2010.
MEDICATIONS: Albuterol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic; simulation are completed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces rhythmic theta. Intermittently in drowsiness, there is some rhythmic left to right temporal theta but none that is specifically pathologic. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.

HR: 56 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The previously described, sharply contoured in theta seen in the first study was not identified. There were some normal variants but nothing that was specifically epileptiform. If seizures recur, additional EEG recording may be valuable.
