LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 83-year-old man who presented for a left carotid endarterectomy the following day.  Past medical history is notable for Alzheimer's dementia, strokes, CABG, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Aricept and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  Voltages are diffusely very low.  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a very low amplitude with 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lowering amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving and multiple flash frequencies.  Heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute is noted on a single electrocardiogram lead.
FINDINGS:
No focal slowing.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a  clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
