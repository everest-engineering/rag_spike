HISTORY: 42 year old man with sudden unconsciousness, found to be in PA code,
shocked In the fetal x 2 to 3 times, having a second PA code later for about 13 minutes; now
with no reflexes on exam.
MEDICATIONS: Norepinephrine, Dopamine, Bitartrate
REASON FOR STUDY: Brain death.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video E.EEG was performed at bedside using the brain death protocol
in addition to the 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and
EKG electrodes. During the recording, all electrodes were tested and the recording was
performed at 2 microvolts per mm. The patient was also stimulated during the recording.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The record reveals an absence of any normal cerebral
electrical activity with an overriding EKG electrode artifact. No normal posterior dominant
rhythm, frontocentral beta, or normal sleep architecture is seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Absence of normal cerebral activity, low voltage recording even
at 2 microvolts per mL. Using the double-distance electrodes and 2 microvolts, no electrical
activity can be seen.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. absence of normal electrocerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG reveals absence of electrocerebral activity, which in the
right setting, considering the absence of confounding medications or metabolic abnormalities,
with brain death. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen.
