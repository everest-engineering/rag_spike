CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old woman now with recurrent right facial twitching and right-sided shaking.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarb, Tegretol

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is awake.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes a rhythmic theta frequency pattern background. It is a little bit more attenuated in the left temporal region and in the right occipital region. There is eye movement artifact, and there is occasional left frontal periodic sharp wave. The background EEG is intermittently discontinuous.

HR: N/A
IMPRESSION: Abnormal but overall improved EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The left hemispheric periodic sharp waves are markedly reduced. Correlation with imaging is appropriate. Overall this pattern represents a marked improvement in the overall background. Generalized background slowing supports a more diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
