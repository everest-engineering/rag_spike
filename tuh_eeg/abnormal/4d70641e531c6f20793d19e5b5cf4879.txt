DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient reached stage I and stage II sleep.  She also during the recording had short periods of rapid eye movement noted.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed and produced no abnormal discharges.
