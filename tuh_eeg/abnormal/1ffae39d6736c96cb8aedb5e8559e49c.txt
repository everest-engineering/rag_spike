CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old woman status post code followed by seizures on January 7.  The patient now has stimulus-induced blinking.  Manipulation of the patient including suctioning increased motor activity.
MEDICATIONS:  Clindamycin, Phenytoin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient is stimulated during the EEG.  She has facial blinking and grimacing.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The unstimulated EEG is a relatively low voltage, featureless record.  There are bursts with some rhythmic theta.  There are rare T6 sharp waves noted in the background, essentially 1 T6 sharp wave. Tactile stimulation of the patient produces an increase in the blinking, an increase in the heart rate, and a small increase in theta.
96 to 100 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Markedly slow background.
An intermittently attenuating background.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A single right temporal sharp wave was identified. No PLEDS were seen.  In comparison to the EEG one day prior, this EEG is a bit slower.  The eye blinking is not a seizure.
