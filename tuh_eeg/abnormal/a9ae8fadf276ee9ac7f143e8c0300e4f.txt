CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old right handed male with 6 seizures today, vagal nerve stimulator.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Phenobarbital, Vimpat, Zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly abnormal with general beta.  There is posteriorly predominate rhythmic slowing with rhythmic 3-5 Hz activity.  There appear to be sharp waves in the occipital or occipitoparietal regions right more so than the left.  There are paroxysmal bursts of posterior slowing.  Relaxed wakefulness is remarkable for a prominent beta pattern. Photic stimulation does seem to elicit a driving response which is merely a photic paroxysmal response.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Prominent beta.
An abnormal background without the normal developmental milestones.
Posteriorly predominant, almost generalized, epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to prior EEGs. No seizures were recorded.
