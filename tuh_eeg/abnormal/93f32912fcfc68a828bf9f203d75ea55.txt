CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed male with epilepsy, seizure-free since 1993, but has episodes of trembling in the hands and legs.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a modest amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Central mu rhythm is identified but testing is not performed to confirm this. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in background slowing with a small degree of shifting slowing. Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to a previous study in 2005, no left central or temporal sharp waves were identified.
