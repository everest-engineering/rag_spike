CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old male with mental retardation and epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Ativan, Keppra, Trileptal,
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow, disorganized, and lacking in the normal morphologies of an awake EEG. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and produces occasional bursts of rhythmic, bifrontal sharp waves. In stage 1 and stage 2 sleep there are rudimentary vertex waves and spindles. In addition, frontally predominant spike and wave and polyspike and wave complexes with a slow spike and wave frequency are identified. These are maximum on the left, but have some bilateral representation. Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the record and is performed while the Individual in stage 2 sleep where the epileptiform activity is prominent.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Frontal spike and slow wave activity and left frontal spike and stow wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were seen in 2 previous EEGs dated August 8, 2008 and September 28, 2008.
