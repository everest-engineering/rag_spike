CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 51-year-old man status post TDI with subdural hematoma, tracheostomy, nursing home resident, vegetative state.  No report of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  GlucaGen, metoprolol, and others.  No anti-seizure medications listed.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  The patient was recorded on the stretcher.  He was not able to cooperate with testing.  Photic stimulation was completed but hyperventilation was not possible.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Technical:  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact.  The EEG was recorded for 24 minutes in an attempt to reduce the muscle.
When the patient is not experiencing muscle artifact, the EEG is low voltage and featureless.  There is a suggestion of low voltage alpha frequency activity in the background with some 8 Hz activity.  There is also some low voltage theta.  The patient is not able to cooperate with testing to determine if there is an alpha rhythm.  The overall pattern is more of a low voltage alpha theta pattern of 6-8 Hz.  The patient is spastic and the technologist attempts to reposition the patient to reduce the muscle artifact without success.  Lateral rectus and lateral eye movement artifacts were noted.
Photic stimulation:  No photic driving response was identified.
Heart rate:  112 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to replacement of normal background with a low voltage mixed frequency pattern rich in alpha and theta frequency activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In terms of assessing the patient's interactivity with the environment, this EEG was not successful at doing so.  If seizures are an important consideration a more prolonged tracing capture in sleep might be of value.  Alternatively, evoked potentials may play some prognostic role in this clinical scenario.
