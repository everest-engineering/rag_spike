CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right-handed male. Epilepsy since the 1960s, last seizure in early June, tonic-clonic seizures with generalized activity, falling and questionable injury.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Seroquel.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is a 1 hour sleep deprived EEG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a low voltage, 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation is performed early in the record and produces some subtle focal slowing from the left temporal region. This is followed by drowsiness with slow rolling eye movements. Some sharply contoured slowing is again noted at T1. Rare left temporal sharp waves are also noted in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves are noted in sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle focal slowing identified in hyperventilation and sleep.
2. Subtle left temporal sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy.
