CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old right handed woman with difficulty concentrating and retaining information. She has a past history of meningitis in infancy with seizures until age 12 or 13.

MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz 40 to 50 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with posterior slow waves of youth. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing head rocking artifact. Hyperventilation also produces tachycardia. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic central theta as well as anterior spread of the alpha rhythm followed by vertex waves. Posts are also noted.
Sleep is intermittently disrupted. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is finally drifting into stage II sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 60 to 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study in sleep may be helpful.
