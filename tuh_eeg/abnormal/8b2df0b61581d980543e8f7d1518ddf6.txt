CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old left-handed male with a TBI some time ago.  The patient presented to an outside hospital after 2 unwitnessed seizures, not otherwise described.  History of epilepsy over the past 5 years.  Prior seizure was 3 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In the transition to drowsiness, there is an increase in background theta.  Vertex waves were noted in sleep.
There are occasional bursts of slowing in the transition to sleep, but none that were pathological.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
