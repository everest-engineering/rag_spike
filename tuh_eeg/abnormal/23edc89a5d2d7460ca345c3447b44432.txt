CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed woman with episodes of right hand
shaking, amnestic for events, diabetes, hypertension, stroke.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Coumadin, Protonix, Novolog, Plavix, Metoprolol, Lipitor,
Atorvastatin, Metformin, Carbamazepine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates an unusual
pattern. In apparent wakefulness, the activity is a bit slow with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and
some excess theta appearance. There are paroxysmal bursts of frontally predominant,
sharply contoured irregular delta. Some of the bursts are notched. In fact, there seems
to be a subtle sharp and slow wave complex in the right frontal region in this activity. As the recording continues and the patient is a bit more relaxed, the activity is seen In more prolonged bursts. In addition, there is some sharply contoured discharges from the left frontal region. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response and does not clearly alter this frontally predominant paroxysmal activity.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing and disorganization.
2. Suspicious, frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral
function. The paroxysmal bursts can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy,
but they could also be in a frontal lobe process, hydrocephalus or other disturbance.
Suspicious sharp waves are noted.
