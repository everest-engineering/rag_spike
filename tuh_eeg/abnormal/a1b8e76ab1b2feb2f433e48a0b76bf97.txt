CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed gentleman with two tonic-clonic seizures in 2006 but occasional auras of right hand twitching. A somewhat abnormal MRI. Now seizure-free for many years with low Depakote levels. Episode of a little right arm stiffness in 2009 in sleep.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: During wakefulness the background EEG is well-organized with an alpha rhythm of 9.5 Hz reaching amplitudes up to 90 mV. Central Mu rhythm is identified but testing is not performed to confirm this. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation products and increase in amplitude to the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. In comparison to previous electroencephalograms, the electroencephalogram in 2008 was normal, but the electroencephalogram in 2009 did identify a right temporal sharp wave.
