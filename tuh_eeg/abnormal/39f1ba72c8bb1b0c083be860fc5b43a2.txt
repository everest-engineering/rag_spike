CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed woman with chronic subcortical infarcts, tremor, lupus, and heart failure.

MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Celexa, Ecotrin, Plavix, Synthroid, Isosorbide, Zocor, Micardis, Citalopram, Detrol, Protonix, Lovenox
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient seems to be drowsy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in the beta. Photic stimulation is remarkable for photoelectric artifact tremor and scant driving.

HR: 72 to 84 bpm with notched QRS.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. This is a normal EEG for an adult of this age.
