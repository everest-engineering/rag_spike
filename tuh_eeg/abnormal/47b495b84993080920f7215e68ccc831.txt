CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed woman, 13-weeks pregnant, with recurrent syncopal events.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG performed in lab was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not done.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well developed, appropriately high amplitude posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. There is occasional electrode artifact, but the tech notes that the patient just had a hair weave removed and the scalp is quite oily. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed. However, if epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing sleep may be needed.
