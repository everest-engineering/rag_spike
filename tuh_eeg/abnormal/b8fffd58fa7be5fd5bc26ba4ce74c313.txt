LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 54-year-old man who presents with chief complaint of dizzy spells.  Of note, there is a past medical history of generalized convulsions and falling.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well formed and modulated 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There are anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates,  vertex waves and sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation produces mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 27-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
