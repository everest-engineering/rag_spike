MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode. The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I and stage II. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some frontal temporal electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Heart rate:  84 and regular.
The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz and is reactive to eye opening.  There is a prominent frontal, and mainly central beta, which at times is slightly sharply contoured.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.
Activating procedures were performed.  She has a nice hyperventilation effort with no clear abnormalities and her photic stimulation does not reveal any abnormalities.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
