CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old male with endocarditis, status post code last night.  The patient had prolonged cardiac arrest, required temporary pacer and then developed myoclonic jerks today.  Now requiring dialysis.
MEDICATIONS:  Fentanyl, Versed, fosphenytoin, Ativan.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was intubated, comatose and had occasional jerks.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG pattern demonstrates a burst suppression pattern.  The overall pattern is suppressed with some ICU artifact.  At a sensitivity of 3 there is scant low voltage activity and ICU artifact. The bursts of activity are typically 1.5 seconds in duration and include muscle activity, some fast activity and a paroxysmal burst of slow at the beginning and one at the offset.
Stimulation of the patient did not activate the record.
Heart rate 84 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Burst suppression pattern with markedly suppressed activity.
Bursts which occur approximately every 10 seconds lasting 1-3 seconds in duration.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No clinical seizures were noted.  No spontaneous reactivity or variability were observed.  In this individual who is more than 12 hours post cardiac arrest, these findings carry a very worrisome prognosis.
