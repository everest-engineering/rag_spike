CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed woman with a generalized convulsive seizure lasting 30 seconds with postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Singulair, Synthroid, birth control pills.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces prominent bursts of rhythmic, high amplitude paroxysmal frontal delta. Some of this is notched. Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits driving with a supra harmonic driving response.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  If a generalized epilepsy is an important consideration, a followup study, fasting with prolonged hyperventilation is suggested.
