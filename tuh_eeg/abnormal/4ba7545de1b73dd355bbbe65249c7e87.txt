CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 55-year-old woman with restless legs syndrome and epilepsy, as well as generalized anxiety disorder.  Currently, seizure-free for 2 years but has a feeling as if her left leg is moving, as if there is something inside of her leg, associated with leg pain.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Zoloft, Requip, insulin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This is a technically satisfactory, routine, greater than 20 minute EEG with photic stimulation.  This is a primarily awake record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates an awake pattern with a patient who appears anxious with frequent muscle movement.  A 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm was identified.  Abundant lambda was noted.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.  Heart rate 110 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG primarily in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The vigorous driving described above was noted in the 2006 EEG.  This is the 2nd, normal EEG for this adult.
