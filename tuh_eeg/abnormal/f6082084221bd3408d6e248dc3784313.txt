CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old left handed male, status epilepticus, fungal infection.
MEDICATIONS: Pantoprazole, Mycamine, Cefepime, Vanco, Heparin, Dopamine, Norepinephrine.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background demonstrates a lower voltage mixed frequency theta delta pattern from the left with ongoing sharp waves and spikes from the right hemisphere which can be anterior temporal or posterior temporal or central temporal. There is frequency evolution of the epileptiform activity, but no clinical seizures. The right hemisphere also demonstrates significant background slowing. Tactile stimulation of the patient does not activate the record.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Absence of reactivity to tactile stimulation.
3. Prominent ongoing PLEDS plus from the right hemisphere with some frequency evolution.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were observed. If additional information is needed, a followup study may be considered.
