CLINICAL HISTORY: 78 year old male with persistent, refractory status epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Hydralazine, ASA, Lovenox, Lorazepam, Zocor, Lisinopril, Depacon,
Coreg, Pyridoxine, Topamax, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is confused.
Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG continues to demonstrate an
occipitally predominant periodic sharp wave but the sharp wave is a bit more itinerant
with a periodicity of approximately once per second or every other second. There is
variability in the record. No clinical seizures are recorded. This pattern is accompanied
by a rhythmic theta pattern from both hemispheres with arrhythmic delta activity on the
left posterior quadrant.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left occipital periodic complex.
2. Left posterior delta.
3. Background slowing from both hemispheres.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There may be a bit more slowing in this record in
comparison to others; however, the epileptiform activity is abating.
