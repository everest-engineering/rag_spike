CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed male with a long history of epilepsy, recurrent hospitalization for seizures, history of posttraumatic epilepsy and postictal stridor. History of frontal encephalomalacia and substance abuse.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Percocet, HCTZ, Pantoprazole, Lovenox, Valproate Sodium
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The overall background is relatively low voltage. The patient is relatively drowsy. There is a glimpse of an 8.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a pattern with excess 6 Hz theta activity. Head rocking artifact is noted in the posterior regions more so on the right. There is generous beta noted in the record. Occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal slowing are noted.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing
2. Rhythmic frontal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the sixth EEG for this individual. The background slowing has been previously described. No right or left frontal or temporal sharp waves were observed in this recording. Prior EEGs have supported a focal for mechanism for seizures either from the right or the left hemisphere.
