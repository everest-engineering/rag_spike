CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 68-year-old woman who was talking to a friend, had a brief loss of consciousness while sitting at the table.  The patient reports not being post ictal, does not describe any symptoms to suggest a seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol and blood pressure medications.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Other features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in the EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
