CLINICAL HISTORY:   49 year old right handed male with past history of stroke, epilepsy.  Seizures usually occur after alcohol consumption.  All seizures occur at 4:30 in the morning.  Past history of bilateral infarcts, right MCA, left frontal, bilateral superior cerebellar.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Simvastatin, Pradaxa, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Protonix, Glyburide
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG today is reasonably well organized.  There is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm identified on the left, but it a bit slower on the right.  There is a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity on the right, relative to the left. As the patient becomes drowsy, the asymmetry between the 2 hemispheres becomes a bit more prominent with more of a drop out of faster frequency activity on the right than the left and some lower voltage slowing.  Spindles are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep.  A scant driving response is seen.
HR:    72 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slowing in the right hemisphere characterized by disruption of the alpha rhythm, intermittent disruption of faster frequency activity and some underlying theta delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is significantly improved from his previous study on October 10, 2011.  The organization on the left hemisphere is now relatively normal.  No epileptiform features were seen in either of the two EEGs.
