CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old right handed female with epilepsy with 1á2 seizures per
month.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Zonegram, Synthroid, Valium
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1Q-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is disorganized for a
young adult of this age. The alpha rhythm reaches 10.7. There is an alpha asymmetry with
faster frequency alpha activity and more beta on the right compared to the left. There is excess theta in the background. In addition, there are sharp waves seen in this sharply contoured record in wakefulness which can be different shaded from the eye artifact and they are seen independently at T2 and T1. Features of drowsiness Included Increase in rhythmic slowing. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude or the background. Drowsiness Is characterized by some shifting slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Disorganization.
3. Infra hemispheric asymmetry with a slower alpha rhythm on the left.
4. Rare, isolated sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional EEG recording is necessary to more completely
characterize this individual's epilepsy. This EEG supports the diffuse disturbance of
cerebral function. The asymmetry In alpha and the asymmetry in beta may be correlated with
imaging.
