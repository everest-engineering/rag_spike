CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman with a 10-year history of epilepsy, last seizure 2 days ago with shaking, eye rolling, foaming at the mouth, incontinence of bowel and bladder.
PAST HISTORY:  MI and stroke with right hemiparesis, weakness, depression, and bipolar disease.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote, Klonopin, and albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed.  Photic stimulation was deferred.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
TECHNICAL:  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is somewhat disorganized.  There is a glimpse of an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a bit more variability in the alpha rhythm than would otherwise be expected.  There is excess background theta.  As the patient becomes a bit drowsy, there is occasional focal slowing characterized by subtle underlying theta or delta from the left hemisphere.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.
Heart rate 108 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Background disorganization.
Subtle underlying slowing in the left hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this awake and briefly drowsy record.  If additional information is needed, a repeat tracing capturing sleep may be of value.
