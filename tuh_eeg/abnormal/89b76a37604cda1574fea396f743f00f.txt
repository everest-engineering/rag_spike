CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old male with closed head injury, status post left craniectomy, status post seizure on the 24th.

MEDICATIONS: Versed drip, Dilantin, Fentanyl. Mannitol, Vanco, Lovenox

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and unresponsive with left ventriculostomy.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly abnormal. It is low voltage and slow. In addition, there is an interhemispheric asymmetry with slower activity on the left compared to the right. There is a breach rhythm with a bit more beta on the left compared to the right in the frontal regions. Occasionally there is some theta picked up in the right hemisphere. There is also intermittently some slow periodic delta from the right. Stimulation of the patient does seem to accentuate the theta from the left. There are rare eye movements.

HR: 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Some periodic arrhythmic delta activity from the right hemisphere.
3. An interhemispheric asymmetry with slower activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. Overall this EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function. Some of the features described above may be due to the patient's sedative hypnotic medications.
