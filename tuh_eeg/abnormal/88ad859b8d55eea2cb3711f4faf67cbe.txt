CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed woman with headaches, Beh√ßet disease, Lyme disease, now with increasing episodes where she loses tract of time for seconds.
MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril, Pepcid, Protonix, Motrin, Cacctracine (?)
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age with an alpha rhythm of 10 hertz. There is a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic slowing of the background and increase in synchronicity. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study is suggested.
