CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right handed woman with recurrent dizzy spells, poor memory, lightheadedness.
MEDICATIONS: Zanaflex.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 hertz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Occasional posterior slow waves of youth are noted in relaxed wakefulness. Hyperventilation produces rhythmic high amplitude sign. Photic stimulation elicits a subtle driving response and then is followed by transition toward sleep.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Posterior slow waves of youth are a normal finding.
