CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old right handed gentleman with an episode of loss of
consciousness several months ago, previously treated with Dilantin in 2009. History of
diabetes, hearing loss, and childhood epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm with an increase in theta. There is
some single channel artifact picked up in the right frontal central region as the patient
becomes drowsy. In addition to this single channel artifact, there is a suggestion of
focal, rhythmic frontal theta, which persists throughout photic stimulation. Photic
stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Right frontal theta.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features were observed, but the right
frontal rhythmic theta is sometimes seen in localization related epilepsy. It was not
identified in previous years. Clinical evaluation is suggested. Of note, this patient had
a previous craniotomy with a breech rhythm which might explain the rhythmic theta
discharge.
