CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old right handed female with epilepsy with recurrent seizures in pregnancy.

MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic simulation is performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz, 85 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of posterior slow waves. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic theta followed by vertex waves in stage I sleep. Brief epochs of stage II sleep with bursts of K-complexes and spindles are interrupted with an awake pattern. Head rocking artifact is picked up particularly in the posterior regions. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response. Some electrode artifacts and pops are noted during photic.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is some head rocking artifact noted in the occipital scalp regions but no epileptiform features were noted.
