CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed woman with a history of hydrocephalus and VP shunt.  History of epilepsy with a blackout seizure during sleep in November.  The patient reports that she is aware of her seizures when they happen, but cannot move.  In 2010, she had been seizure free for 4 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, Temazepam, Alprazolam, Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  A subtle breach rhythm is noted in the frontal region particularly on the right with accentuation 19 Hz activity in that region.  Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, producing an increase in amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, but deeper stages of sleep were not achieved today.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The breach rhythm is an anticipated finding following craniotomy.  This is the second normal EEG for this patient.  Her previous EEG was 2 years ago.
