LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 59-year-old man who presents with 2 episodes of syncope/near syncope in the setting of diffuse myalgia, dizziness, and fingerstick glucose of about 600.  Of note, the patient has a history of seizures; however, his seizures differ from these episodes.  CAT scan of the brain showed a likely meningioma near the right occipital region.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, lovastatin, carbamazepine, and primidone.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude 9 to 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, bursts of diffuse theta and delta are captured, and vertex waves are seen.  During brief stage II sleep, symmetrical sleep spindles are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at medium to high flash rates.  A regular heart rate is captured in the single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:  No epileptiform discharges and stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 23-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
