CLINICAL HISTORY:  79 year old female with history of stroke, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia presents with a left MCA stroke and right-sided weakness found unresponsive.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Pravastatin, Amlodipine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with anterior temporal and additional single lead EKG electrode.  Wakefulness and lethargy were recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to mildly diffusely slow background with posterior dominant rhythm which is best seen over the right hemisphere and at best reaches 8 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  Some frontocentral beta seen over the right hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Photic stimulation reveals no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen continuously over the left hemisphere maximal in the T3 electrode.  There is also related loss of faster frequencies over that hemisphere.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz occurring during wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous left hemispheric slowing maximum on the mid temporal region.
Mild excessive theta during wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with focal structural cerebral dysfunction in the left hemisphere maximal the mid temporal region which is consistent with the known stroke in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
