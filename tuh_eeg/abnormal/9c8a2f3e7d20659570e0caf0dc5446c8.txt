CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed man with past medical history of head injury, behavioral issues.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Aricept, Trazodone, Depakote, Oxycodone, Naproxen, Levetiracetam, Valproic Acid, Levothyroxine, Citalopram
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a generalized slow pattern. There is breach rhythm seen in the left central temporal region. Photic stimulation did not elicit driving. There is a small degree of shifting slowing and there was some head rocking artifact in the right posterior quadrant.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Shifting slowing
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to EEGs from 2005 there is no epileptiform activity observed. However, the background demonstrates increasing slowing. This patient's multiple seizure medications and the episode may contribute to the background slowing. If this Is not the case additional neurologic evaluation may be needed.
