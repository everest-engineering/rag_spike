CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old male with HIV encephalopathy admitted following seizure, elevated serum ammonia.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lorazepam, Tylenol, Ceftriaxone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow with a mixture of theta and delta. There are some shifting asymmetries as well as single channel artifact. There is a suggestion of a poly spike focus in the left posterior region, T5 O1. When the patient is unstimulated, he drifts off to sleep with an increase in background slowing. The area with fast activity and small discrete sharp waves continues into the sleep pattern. Other features of drowsiness or sleep include an increase in beta. The patient arouses spontaneously, but remains confused. Occasional FIRDA is observed.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Left occipital temporal sharp wave focus with poly spike activity.
3. FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function effecting both gray and white matter. The focal epileptiform activity may be correlated with imaging. Followup studies and correlation with imaging may be of value.
