STUDY DATE:  11/30/2012.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Syncope.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 72-year-old female admitted with syncope and a sudden change in mental status after a code with tachycardia and  hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Tramadol, Tylenol, lorazepam, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at times reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  In general, the background has intermittent theta bursts even during wakefulness at 6-7 Hz seen diffusely.  The patient does appear to become drowsy at times.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Excessive theta in wakefulness at 5-7 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts seen intermittently throughout the recording.
Abnormal discharges:
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals mild to moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
