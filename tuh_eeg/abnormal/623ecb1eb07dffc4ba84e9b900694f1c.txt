REASON FOR STUDY:  Twitching of the mouth, rule out seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 42-year-old man with mental retardation presents with complaints of mouth twitching and confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  Citalopram, __________.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some prefrontal electrode artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
EVENTS:  During the recording the patient has 1 episode of mouth twitching which has a myogenic correlate, but no epileptiform EEG correlate during it.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and sleep EEG.  No seizures were captured.  The episode of mouth twitching had no EEG correlate.  As such, it may represent a nonepileptic event or alternatively may represent a simple partial epileptic event which in up to 75% of the cases does not have an EEG correlate.
