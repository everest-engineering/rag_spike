CLINICAL HISTORY:  Syncope with blurry vision, and impaired vision in the left eye, seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Gabapentin, verapamil, Flomax, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  This is a routine awake and sleep EEG with acceptable impedances aside from the T2 electrode.  In addition, eye movements are slightly asymmetric.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 12 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Alpha squeak was identified.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited a low voltage driving response.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this individual with a question of seizure versus syncope.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
