CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old female with migraine, asthma, COPD, Behcet
syndrome, history of lightheaded episodes last seconds with loss of awareness 4 to 5
times per day but no tonic-clonic activity.
MEDICATIONS: Hydrochlorothiazide, Lisinopril, Amitriptyline, ASA, Lovastatin,
Prednisone
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is
appropriately organized. There is an 11.5 Hz, 40 microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm in
a background rich with low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is
characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response.
HR: 96 bpm. Occasional PVC's.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Additional evaluation may be sought to determine the
cause of this individual's intermittent spacey spells. There is generous beta which can
be seen in a sleep-deprived or anxious individual.
