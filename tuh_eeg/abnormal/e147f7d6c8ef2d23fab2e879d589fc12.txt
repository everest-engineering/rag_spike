CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old right handed woman with bilateral left eyelid weakness.
MEDICATIONS: Actonel, Nifedipine, Indapamide
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. There is prominent head-rocking artifact noted. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta. Vertex waves are observed in stage I sleep. Brief spindles are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features were identified. If evaluation for a neuromuscular cause for an ocular process is needed, a follow-up in the EMG Lab may be desired.
