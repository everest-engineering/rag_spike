LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old man who was admitted on 08/07/2013, with a change in mental status, generalized weakness, confusion and slurred speech.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, Lovenox, Colace, Diovan, Plavix, Coreg, and Percocet.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with the addition of T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low amplitude 10 to 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is captured.  Brief drowsiness is observed by the end of the recording and is characterized by diffuse voltage attenuation and disappearance of the posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation does not produce abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a  routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The excess beta could be secondary to a medication effect such benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
