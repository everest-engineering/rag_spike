CLINICAL HISTORY: 22 year old male with epilepsy since the age of 2 with tonic-clonic
seizures which remitted and were followed by staring spells with postictal periods of 5 hours. Seizure-free for the past 4 years.
MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not possible but photic
stimulation was performed. This Is an awake and asleep record with photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, t h ere is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a
sharply contoured record. There is generous low voltage frontocentral beta activity, some theta· and some intermittent disorganization. Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic theta. There is EKG artifact in the T2 electrode and a rare, T3 sharp wave which can be differentiated from the EKG. As the patient becomes drowsier, a discrete, left frontal sharp wave is observed. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR: 104bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Excess beta.
2. Excess theta.
3. Small amount of background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are only 3 sharp waves Identified in this record which can
b e differentiated from EKG artifact. They are in the left temporal and frontal regions suggesting a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. If additional information is needed, a more prolonged study capturing sleep may be helpful. The PATIENT’S rapid heart rate may to the difficulty discerning epileptiform activity from EKG artifact.
