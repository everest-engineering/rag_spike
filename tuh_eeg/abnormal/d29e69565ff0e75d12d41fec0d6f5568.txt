CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old right handed male with a tonic, clonic seizure 1
month ago, found to have a cavernous hemangioma pre-op for surgery on 02/10.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Oxcarbazepine, Amoxicillin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab .using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5hertz posterior
dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of theta observed in the temporal regions,
bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include an increase in synchronicity of the
background followed by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm, POSTS and then vertex
waves and spindles in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is
drifting off to sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL No epileptiform features were observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. There is a scant amount of background theta in the temporal regions in relaxed wakefulness particularly in the beginning of the record and a bit more so on the left, but not really outside of the-range of normal particularly with use of this patient's medications. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be considered.
