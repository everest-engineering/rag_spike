CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old left handed woman with epilepsy, last seizure a week ago. Infrequent tonic-clonic seizures occurring 1 every 1 to 2 years. Past history of depression, asthma and hyperlipidemia. Past history of seizures characterized by light-headedness and tonic-clonic activity after she is startled.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Ambien, Advair, Albuterol, Ambroxol (?)
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm identified at times but much of the background is rich in beta and theta frequency activity and overall the overall pattern is more of a beta theta frequency pattern. Hyperventilation produces an increase in rhythmicity of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta. The overall alpha frequency in general in this individual is 8 Hz. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response. Heart rate 60 beats per minute. At the close of the record, the patient appears to be awake briefly, maximally awake when the EEG is better organized.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to: Prominent excess beta and theta identified in this record but not seen continuously.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a 2007, there is excess beta and theta. This may be due to this patient's medications. No epileptiform feature we're identified in either EEG.
