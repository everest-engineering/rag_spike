CLINICAL HISTORY:  Adult female with a history of epilepsy and seizure yesterday.  Patient unable to describe.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Risperdal, Celexa, metformin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a low voltage 11 Hz alpha rhythm with generous low voltage beta.  Rhythmic central theta is noted as the patient transitions to stage 1 sleep with vertex waves, POSTS and again generous beta.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate 60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The beta activity described above can be due to this patient's medications.  No epileptiform features were noted.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study may be of use.
