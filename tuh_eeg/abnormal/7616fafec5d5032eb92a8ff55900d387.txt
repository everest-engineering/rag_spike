CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 52-year-old woman presents with confusion followed by a seizure in the emergency room with left arm shaking and right eye twitching.  This was followed by unresponsiveness and generalized weakness.  History of asthma, depression, dementia, and thalamic stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, Keppra, Protonix, aspirin, and metoprolol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
TECHNICAL ISSUES:  T1 and T2 impedances were 5.7 and 5.9.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In relaxed wakefulness, there was more of a theta frequency background.  There was a subtle asymmetry with rare sharply contoured transients in the hemisphere.  As the patient transitions to sleep, POSTS were noted.  The overall background is a bit more symmetric and there is more of a slow pattern.  Snore artifact was observed.
Heart rate:  BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing.
Shifting asymmetries.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous study performed on the 24th, the background is overall significantly improved.  There are no major epileptiform discharges and no seizures were recorded.
