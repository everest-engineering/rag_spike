REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 80-year-old man admitted for right lung lobectomy due to cancer, found to have decreased oxygen saturation and witnessed seizure, with a past medical history of colon cancer, seizures, hepatitis C, psoriasis, dementia, lung cancer, colon surgery, and prior EEG in July 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, albuterol, famotidine, cefepime, morphine, heparin, clonazepam, lisinopril, Aricept, and Zofran.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recording during wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen intermittently at T3 and independently at T4 and sometimes at F4/C4 and sometimes at F3/C3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
There is excessive theta at 5-7 Hz in wakefulness.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing as well as focal slowing in the bilateral mid temporal region as well as central frontal regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral mid temporal regions, as well as frontal central regions, in addition to mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, all of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No clear seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
