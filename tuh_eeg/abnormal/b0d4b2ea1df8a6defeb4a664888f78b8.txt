CLINICAL HISTORY: 37 year old right handed female, childhood epilepsy with tonic-clonic, myoclonic and absence seizure, currently seizure free for many years.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort producing bursts of rhythmic, paroxysmal frontal slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted in this EEG. A previous EEG in 2006 was also normal, but older EEGs were not available for comparison.
