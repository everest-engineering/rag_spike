CLINICAL HISTORY:  62 year old right handed male with epilepsy following MCA infarct with aphasia. Last seizure was September 11 with confusion and staring.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, there is a well defined, 9 hertz alpha rhythm on the right. This is disrupted on the left. In relaxed wakefulness, not only is there disruption of faster frequency activity, but in the posterior quadrants, there is focal, 5 hertz activity. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response better identified on the right.
HR:    78 bpm and slightly irregular
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slowing from the left hemisphere characterized by disruption of faster frequency activity and the appearance of slower frequency activity earlier in the posterior regions and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the left involving gray and white matter. In contrast to the previous EEG on October 8, 2009, no complex partial seizure was recorded.
