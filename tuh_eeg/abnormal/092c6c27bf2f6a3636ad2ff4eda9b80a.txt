TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness, stage 1 and stage 2 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  Hyperventilation also did not produce any abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  78.
