CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old woman with a long history of epilepsy, psychosis admitted with recurrent seizures and confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is slow and disorganized. In addition, superimposed upon this are bursts of arrhythmic and rhythmic theta and delta, maximum in the right temporal regions but sometimes seen in isolation on the left. The later sections of the recording including drowsiness include frontally-predominant 3-4 Hz high amplitude activity with a suspicious underlying right frontal sharp wave. This is also noted during photic stimulation.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing and disorganization.
2. Rhythmic right temporal epileptiform activity.
3. Right frontal rhythmic high amplitude 3-4 Hz activity as well as perhaps and underlying spike and slow wave complex.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing has been seen intermittently for this individual. The epileptiform activity has also been previously noted. No seizures were recorded, but a search to determine whether or not this patient is postictal or is having an acute metabolic encephalopathy is suggested. â•–
