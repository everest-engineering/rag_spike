CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed woman with 2 to 3 headaches a week,
evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Relpax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized,
low voltage with 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage,
frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background
slowing. Vertex waves are seen in stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
