REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old man presents with status post craniectomy for subdural hemorrhages, after the surgery now with recurrent seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a mildly diffuse slow background but it has a posterior dominant rhythm during wakefulness which reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and sleep, stage 1 and stage II.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Mild generalized slowing at 5 to 7 Hz seen in wakefulness intermittently, but excessively.
Focal slowing seen over the left frontal region at F3/C3 at 2 to 4 Hz, amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
Heart rate 86.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing as well as left frontal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction and structural dysfunction in the left frontal region, which may be related to the known craniotomy and previous hemorrhage.
There is evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology and may be due, at least in part, to medication effect.
No seizures were seen.
