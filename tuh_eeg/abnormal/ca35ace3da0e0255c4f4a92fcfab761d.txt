LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old woman who presented in change in mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Amlodipine, methadone, gemfibrozil and levothyroxine.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was performed, photic stimulation was not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta activity admixed with less frequent delta activity.  Additional brief bursts of moderate to high amplitude diffuse frontally predominant delta activity (FIRDA) captured.  There is a paucity of faster frequencies over the left hemisphere.  No normal sleep architecture is observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results show no change in the background.  Step photic stimulation is not performed.  A single EKG lead demonstrates heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
FIRDA.
Focal left hemispheric slowing.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 21 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing and focal left hemispheric slowing.  Diffuse slowing indicates etiologically nonspecific  moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Focal left hemispheric slowing indicates focal cerebral dysfunction, possibly structural in etiology.  FIRDA could be secondary to encephalopathy, increased intracranial pressure and deep white matter lesions.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Thank you so much.
