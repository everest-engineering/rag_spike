CLINICAL HISTORY: 45-year-old right handed male with epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Continuous digital video EEG monitoring is performed at bedside using 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient and the clinical team did not obscene any seizures. Random wakefulness and sleep and wakefulness there is a well formed 9 Hz alpha rhythm. There is problematic EKG artifact throughout much of the EEG. Despite this, there are rare right frontotemporal sharp waves noted in the background. Vertex waves and spindles are noted in stage II sleep. Sleep is somewhat disrupted. There is occasional eye movement noted in sleep, as well.
LONG TERM MONITORING-# 11-55 -06/08/2011 to 06/09/2011
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well organized 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a great deal of EKG artifact. Despite this, the re are rare right frontal or frontal temporal discrete spikes. These are seen primarily in relaxed wakefulness and on rare occasions are associated with subtle right frontal temporal local slowing. Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves, K-complexes, and spindles.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Very subtle local slowing.
2. Subtle right frontal or frontal temporal discrete sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal mechanism for seizures. Unfortunately no seizures were recorded.
