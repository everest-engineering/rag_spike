CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 52-year-old woman with childhood epilepsy, break through seizures in 2004 & 2009, with recurrent a seizure in recent weeks requiring medication adjustment. Seizures in 2004 described as left-sided shaking with incontinence of bladder, lasting up to 30 minutes, 1-2 times per year.
MEDICATIONS:  Unclear.  No longer Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is a technically satisfactory record with some head rocking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there was a 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements with attenuation of the alpha rhythm, alpha squeak was noted on occasion.  Other features of the drowsy pattern included an increase in background theta.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult over a 9 year period.  The last EEG demonstrated epileptiform activity was in 2004, demonstrating left temporal focal slowing and sharp waves and a single right central temporal sharp wave.  That EEG was recorded in closer proximity to for a clinical event.
A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
