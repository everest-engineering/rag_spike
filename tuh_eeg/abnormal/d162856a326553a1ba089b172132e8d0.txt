REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 60-year-old female with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme status post resection of left frontal region in 2012 with radiotherapy and now the patient with speech difficulty.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, insulin, lisinopril, betamethasone.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm which is 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
Heart rate 78.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Sharp waves seen over T3 and independently F3 frequently in wakefulness.  At times this appeared to become somewhat rhythmic but never appeared to evolve.
Subtle slow waves seen at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  There is also significant amplitudes over the left hemisphere consistent with a breach rhythm.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left temporal focal slowing and frequent sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left frontal and/or midtemporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction and structural damage to that region which is consistent with the known tumor.  No seizures were clearly seen.
