CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed male admitted to the hospital on April 18, 2010 with a left perisylvian Infarct characterized by language difficulty and significant confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Digoxin, Zocor, Coumadin, Lanoxin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is nearly continuous, rhythmic slowing in the left anterior temporal region. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, followed by bilateral frontal slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at 7 Hz and faster flash frequencies.
HR: 60 bpm with significant EKG artifact.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left frontal temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The focal slowing is in the region of this patient's recent infarct. This EEG contrasts to a previous EEG in 2006, which was a normal study. That study was performed for an episode of 1 hour of aphasia. No epileptiform features were noted in either EEG.
