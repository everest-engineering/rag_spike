CLINICAL HISTORY:  he patient is a 54-year-old woman with past medical history of substance abuse who now presents with short-term memory problems in the setting of recent fall without loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies and lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness bursts of bitemporal theta activity and diffuse theta activity are captured.  No stage II sleep is recorded.  During hyperventilation, there is a mild diffuse symmetric background slowing.  Photic stimulation results in symmetric occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 24-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured, however, stage II sleep is not recorded.  If a clinical suspicion for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
