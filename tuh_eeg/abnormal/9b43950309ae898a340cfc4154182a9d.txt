CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed male with recurrent episodes of syncope characterized by lightheadedness, dizziness. Chest pain, loss of consciousness, falling
with shortness of breath. Shoulder injury. Past history of hypertension, diabetes,
thyroid disease, glaucoma, migraine headaches. Atrial fibrillation. Three-year history of
recurrent syncope versus seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Morphine, Percocet, Celexa, Insulin, Abilify, Cardizem, Metoprolol, Klonopin, Lovenox, ASA, Klonopin, Methimazole, Sucralfate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age with a 10-Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient seems to be drowsy, transitioning frequently to stage II sleep with spindles and POSTS. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features identified in this record. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a more prolonged test or an outpatient test, capturing one of the events may be of use.
