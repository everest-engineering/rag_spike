CLINICAL HISTORY:   49-year-old right handed woman with a long history of complicated migraines, migraine related syncope, gastric dysmotility disorder, and mitral valve prolapse.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta.  Following hyperventilation the patient becomes drowsy with a bit slowing with theta and delta in the temporal regions right or left.  Photic stimulation elicits scant driving at faster flash frequencies.
HR:     78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.
In contrast to previous records, there was no rhythmic mid temporal theta of drowsiness.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of migraine headache or
syncope.
