CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 57-year-old lady with a history of seizures.  Last seizure was 2 weeks ago.  Generalized tonic/clonic movements in sleep.  The patient worked all night before the EEG recording.
MEDICATIONS:  Seizure medicine, name unknown.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and 1-channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness, the background is slow and disorganized with an alpha asymmetry.  The alpha is better visualized on the left hemisphere. There is central temporal beta noted on the right hemisphere. The background slowing is mainly in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, There are occasional left frontal, left frontotemporal, right midtemporal sharp waves.
Hyperventilation caused bilateral slowing of the record.  Photic stimulation did not elicit any abnormal discharges.
Heart rate:  50 beats per minute. Irregular
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Diffuse background slowing.
Alpha asymmetry, disrupted on the right.
Delta range slowing which is frequently sharply contoured independently in temporal region.
Independent left frontotemporal and right midtemporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is suggestive of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in etiology with overlying multifocal epileptogenic process with possible underlying structural abnormality.
