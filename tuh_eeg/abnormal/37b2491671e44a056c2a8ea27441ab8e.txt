CLINICAL HISTORY:  32 year old right handed female with a history of traumatic brain injury and seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 10 to 11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  There is a single sharp transient at F7/T1-A1 seen in the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep; however, the single sharp transient seen in the left anterior temporal region is suspicious.  A
repeated recording with prolonged sleep may aid in qualifying the diagnosis.  No seizures were seen.
