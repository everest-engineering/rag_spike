CLINICAL HISTORY: 53 year old woman with multiple medical problems including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, with a confusional spell, for which the patient was amnestic. The patient also has multiple, brief confusional spells every day.
MEDICATIONS: Lyrica, Celexa, Lasix, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Prilosec, Lovaza
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record, while there is some eye artifact picked up in the T1 and T2 electrodes, there is also some sharply contoured slowing observed. There appear to be some sharp waves noted in the record which do not correlate with the patient's eye movement artifact. These are maximum at T1. This burst of activity is seen most prominently just at the end of hyperventilation with sharply contoured slowing. Later on in the record, just at the end of the hyperventilation with the patient drifting off to sleep, a little bit more clearly defined left temporal sharply contoured slowing is again seen with some isolated bursts. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background theta. During photic stimulation there is a bilateral driving, but again a handful of these sharply contoured bursts are noted.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Left rhythmic temporal focal slowing.
2. Sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The focal slowing is again supportive of this. Additional evaluation may be important to determine if the frequent, daily, subtle space out spells are part of the same phenomenon.
