CLINICAL HISTORY:  59 year old right handed woman who presents with confusion and change in mental status.  She is noted to have jerking movements of face, hands, and right sided weakness.  At baseline has trouble word finding.  Past medical history significant for hypertension and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc, Glyburide, Tylenol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontal central beta seen.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen at F7/T1 rarely.
Focal slow waves seen at F7/T1 frequently throughout the recording at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-80 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal sharp waves and slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of left anterior temporal dysfunction and irritability, which is consistent with a known stroke in that region.  No seizures were seen.
