LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  28 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 44-year-old woman with recurrent episodes of inability to talk, loss of consciousness, fall, associated body tremors and shaking that occurred mostly throughout the month of April 2013.  Afterward, there is no postictal period.  Of note, about 6 years ago she had a generalized tonic/clonic convulsion with a prolonged postictal period.
MEDICATIONS:  __________, simvastatin, Celexa, promethazine inhaler, and clonidine.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated 10-1/2 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  __________ is captured.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta are captured.  Hypoventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 28-minute EEG.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  No epileptiform discharges were captured; however, the patient's sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for seizures persists, a study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
