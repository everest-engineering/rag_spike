CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old woman status post MVA with multiple fractures and pneumothorax, traumatic brain injury.  Initial CT demonstrated cerebral edema.  Follow up CT demonstrated improvement.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilaudid, propofol drip, fentanyl drip, Benadryl, Ativan, ceftriaxone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  This was a technically challenging EEG due to the patient's matted hair and encrusted blood.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a markedly slow pattern with slow delta and some faster frequency activity.  The patient is somewhat interactive despite the background slowing and the technologist reports that with stimulation the patient will move the right hand to command.
There is a small amount of faster frequency activity noted in the frontal regions, as well as slow frontal delta.
Heart rate:  120 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a technically challenging, but markedly abnormal EEG due to:
Marked background slowing.
Shifting slowing with a bit more rhythmic delta noted with stimulation on the left compared to the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  On the whole this EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function with shifting asymmetries, but no specific lateralization.  Although the patient appeared to be responsive to the family, the responsive was difficult to identify.  No epileptiform features were identified.  Given the number of sedative hypnotic medications utilized, medications may play a significant role in the pattern described above.
