CLINICAL HISTORY: 20 year old right handed male with syncope versus seizure episode. Previous episode 2 years ago. The patient has an active exercise program and takes some form of stimulant.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. The patient is noted to be quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep, and in fact, is falling asleep during hyperventilation. Features of stage II sleep include vertex waves, K complexes and spindles. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to stage II sleep. There is a driving response but no epileptiform features.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no focal nor epileptiform features. The excessive drowsiness may be correlated clinically.
