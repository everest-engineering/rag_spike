CLINICAL HISTORY:  70 year old right handed woman with a history of Alzheimer's, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with right-sided weakness as well as episodes of head turning to the right.  She is shaking all extremities.  No confused and less responsive than usual.
MEDICATIONS:  Protonix, ASA, Heparin, Hydralazine, Lorazepam, Metoprolol, Zocor, Simvastatin, Cyanocobalamin, Ceftriaxone, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while poorly unresponsive.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is no normal sleep architecture and no activating procedures were performed.  Overall, the background is consistent with delta frequency wave forms that become very monomorphic at times.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen periodically at 1-2 Hz in the F3/P3 electrodes becoming very rhythmic but not clearly evolving and consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs).
Focal slow waves in the F3 region.
generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and amplitude 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal parietal periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges.
Slowing in addition to generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG revealed evidence of acute structural focal dysfunction and irritability in the left frontoparietal region which has a high correlation with seizures arising from that region.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebellar dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  It may be, in part, related to her Alzheimer dementia disease.
