CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old right handed woman with seizures, memory loss, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress related anxiety.  Past history of complex partial status, currently seizure free on Depakote.
MEDICATIONS:  Risperdal, Depakote, Sertraline, Simvastatin, Lisinopril
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In maximal wakefulness there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  The overall background in maximal wakefulness is appropriate for a subject of this age.  There are occasional bursts of shifting slowing with isolated delta in right or left hemisphere noted early in drowsiness. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation elicits shifting delta from the right or left hemisphere.   Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Shifting slowing from the right or left hemisphere with isolated delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Compared to 2011 EEG this EEG is considerably improved.  There are no left central sharp waves.  In addition, the overall background has improved.
