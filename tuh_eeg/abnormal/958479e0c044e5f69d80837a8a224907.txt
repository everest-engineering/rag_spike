CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 22-year-old gentleman with history of multiple concussions, who presented with staring spells and constant headache.
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the posterior dominant rhythm was 9-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  A stage 1 sleep is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythm, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact as well as the presence of vertex sharp waves and posts.  Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the presence of K complexes and sleep spindles.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 60 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
