CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old left handed make with long standing epilepsy, status post
recent liver transplant, now with recurrent seizures over the weekend, dramatic MRI changes, and obtundation.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Cipro, Lovenox, Daptomycin, Valganciclovir, Insulin, Prednisone

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is trached and poorly responsive.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG includes a mixed frequency pattern
with generous delta and smaller amounts of theta. The most notable features about this record include focal slowing in the right hemisphere with arrhythmic delta and nearly continuous, somewhat periodic sharp waves in the right hemisphere with variable maximum and a generous field of spread. Using an average reference they appear to be maximum at 02, but there is generous involvement at C4, T6, and P4. There is a somewhat unusual dipole and there is variability in the discharges. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous focal slowing from the right hemisphere.
2. Sharp waves from the right with a generous field of spread maximum in the posterior
quadrants.
3. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG differs significantly from last weeks EEG which
demonstrated more of a theta frequency pattern with low voltage frontal, symmetric
spike and wave activity. No seizures were recorded, but this a quite prominent epileptiform focus with a generous field of spread.
