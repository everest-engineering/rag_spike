CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old male with learning disability, seizure free since
2007. Previous history of vertex sharp wave.
MEDICATIONS: Lamictal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awaken and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively
low voltage. There is excess theta in the background and a hint of 9 Hz alpha rhythm.
Later portions of the record demonstrate a more vigorous 10 Hz posterior dominant
rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response, but the patient is drifting into stage
2 sleep.
HR: 56 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in this record
today. There were only on 1 occasion some focal theta in the right central temporal
region. The only other abnormality is really an excess of theta or a variable degree of
background slowing or disorganization. On the whole, these findings are less prominent
than in previous studies. Many years ago there was a vertex spike while awake, but that
was not seen today.
