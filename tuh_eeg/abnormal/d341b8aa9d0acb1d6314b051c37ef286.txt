CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 year old woman with significant cardiac pathology, episodes of V-tach but also syncope. Remote history of seizures. The patient had an episode in the hospital with confusion for which she was amnestic.
MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Plendil, Synthroid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrodes placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is sometimes quite disorganized but at other times there is a 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm, which is disrupted on the left compared to the right.
There is a sharp wave identified in the left hemisphere which is at times periodic, at times prominent. The sharp wave has an unusual field of spread and may be electropositive in the anterior temporal region but in bipolar montages seems to almost have a double phase reversal, comparing the occipital and parietal regions. There
seems to be some electropositivity in the central or parietal region.
Arousal of the patient produces an increase in organization, although there is some focal slowing that remains on the left. Photic stimulation elicits a scant driving response, which is better organized on the right. Arrhythmic delta activity can be seen in the left temporal region, as well. Features of drowsiness included increase in rhythmic frontal delta.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. An unusual sharp wave in the left hemisphere with at times an unusual dipole positivity as well as negativity.
2. Focal slowing in the left temporal region.
3. Intermittent slowing and disorganization, left greater than right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization mechanism for epilepsy. No focal slowing is in the region of the epileptiform activity. Correlation with clinical history and imaging is appropriate.
