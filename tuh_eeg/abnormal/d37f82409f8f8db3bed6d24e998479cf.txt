CLINICAL HISTORY:  58 year old right handed woman with a sharp headache followed by shortness of breath and a black out spell.  Past history of stroke with right sided numbness.
MEDICATIONS:  ASA, Synthroid, Seroquel, Tylenol #3, Naproxen
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 50 mV posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm and slow rolling eye movements. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in background. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no focal or epileptiform features noted in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of stroke or epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration a follow up study may be of value.
