CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed male with a long history of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and thrombocytopenia.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for an adult of this age with a relatively low voltage 11 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background and a small degree of slowing.  This is followed by drowsiness with rhythmic theta.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  In the context of generalized epilepsy in adulthood, epileptiform activity is sometimes elusive. This patient has not had epileptiform activity since 2004.
