CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old male found confused with ataxia, nausea, dizziness and Dilantin level of 39 after consuming 3 cans of beer.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was a little confused during the study. This is an awake and a sleep record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
Technical quality was acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is relatively low voltage and somewhat slow. The overall background includes a 6.5 Hz theta pattern with an alpha rhythm reaching 7.5 Hz.  Occasional shifting slowing was noted in the temporal regions.  As the patient became drowsy, more slow, arrhythmic delta activity was noted.
Photic stimulation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to.
Generalized background slowing.
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Shifting slowing.
Clinical correlation:  No epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as can be seen in a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or a diffuse pattern.  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.
