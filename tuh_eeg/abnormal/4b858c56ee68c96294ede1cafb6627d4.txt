CLINICAL HISTORY: A 35-year-old woman with short-term memory loss, numbness in all extremities, and urinary urgency. Past history of childhood epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Birth control pills.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11-hZ alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening. There is a small amount of low frontage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background theta with occasional bursts of rhythmic frontal delta and rare vertex waves. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If this patient continues to experience symptoms, which may be a seizure, additional EEG recording may be considered.
