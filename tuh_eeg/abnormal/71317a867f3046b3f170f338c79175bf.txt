68 year old female with a history of PCA infant who presents with
MEDICATIONS: None.
REASON FOR EEG: Seizures.
Long term digital video EEG monitoring was performed at bedside over 20
hours using the standard 20 electrode placement with additional interior temporal and EKG
electrodes. The patient was unresponsive during the recording. No activating procedures were
performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES : None.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The record opens to a diffusely background in the 2-4
Hz frequency. No abnormal posterior dominant rhythm is seen or central beta. No
abnormal sleep architecture is seen. No activating procedures are
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz an amplitude 20-30 mV with
frontal intermittent rhythmic delta (FIRDA).
NOTE: During the recording the EEG continues to increase in the frequencies to a more of a
theta range in the 5-7 Hz frequency, which still remains diffusely During stimulation there
is an increase in the frequency and there is multiple artifact.
SEIZURES: None.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized slow waves.
2. FIRDA, improving over time.
This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which
is in regards to etiology, and in this patient it may be due, at least, in part to
effect. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen
