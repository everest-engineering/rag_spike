REASON FOR STUDY:  Episodes of confusion.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 75-year-old man with complaints of confusion, has had several episodes with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, Meniere's, GERD, benign prostatic hyperplasia, heart murmur, stroke, and old right intracerebral thalamic stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, Protonix, diltiazem, aspirin, Plavix, and trazodone.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures include photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.
Abnormal discharges:  None; however, there was one sharply contoured transient at F8/T4, seen once during the recording in drowsiness.
Seizures:  None.
Heart rate:  54 and at times appears to be slightly irregular.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges are clearly seen.  There was one sharply contoured transient at the right anterior temporal region, significance of which is unclear.  Prolonged recording with deeper stages of sleep may be helpful or clinical consideration should be applied.
