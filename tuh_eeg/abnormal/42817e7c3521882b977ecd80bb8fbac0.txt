CLINICAL HISTORY:  73 year old man found down unresponsive.  CT with a right MCA stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Zosyn, Depakote, Lorazepam
REASON FOR STUDY:  Found down, unresponsiveness.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the addition of anterior temporal and singe lead EKG electrode. Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:    None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  No normal sleep architecture was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-50 microvolts were continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen. Please note that when the patient was stimulated there was nice reactivity during the EEG.
