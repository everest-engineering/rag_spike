Seizures variously described as panic attacks, the patient feels her feet become cold, shakes, has loss of consciousness for 2-3 minutes, may bite her tongue.  Occasional lightheadedness.
MEDICATIONS:  Not recorded.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Vertex waves were noted in stage 1 sleep.  K complexes are noted as the patient transitions to stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation did not activate the record.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
This was a 1 hour EEG.
Heart rate 84 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  This is the second normal EEG for this adult.
