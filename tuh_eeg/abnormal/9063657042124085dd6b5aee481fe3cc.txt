CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 56-year-old man with history of TIA and CVA who presents with sudden onset of left facial droop and left arm shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-9.5 Hz in frequency seen, well formed in the left occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere, most pronounced in posterior quadrant.  There is almost continuous 5-6 Hz theta activity intermixed with some 2-3 Hz delta activity in right posterior quadrant.  Drowsiness is characterized by further slowing of the background and disappearance of the alpha rhythm.  Heart rate was 90 beats per minute and regular. Photic stimulation was performed and resulted in no response.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG recording due to almost continuous slowing of the right posterior quadrant and attenuation and loss of faster frequencies in the right cerebral hemisphere, most pronounced in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Continuous slowing, attenuation, and loss of faster frequencies in the right hemisphere are consistent with the patient's history of stroke.  No epileptiform abnormalities or clinical seizures are identified in this record.  This does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy or intermittent seizures.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
