CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old right handed male with epilepsy since age 5, last
seizure at age 16.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized
with 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm had a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral
beta activity. Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm with
rhythmic theta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude. Photic stimulation
elicits scant driving. Occasional head rocking artifact is noted.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features noted. If epilepsy is
an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be
considered. Alternatively, comparison with his childhood EEGs may also be of use.
