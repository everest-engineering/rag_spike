CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 36-year-old male with limbic encephalitis and several-month history of short term memory problems, and diabetes. Evaluate for complex partial epilepsy.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Mu activity was identified, but testing was not performed to confirm this.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation did not significantly the record.
Photic stimulation did elicit a driving response.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep or capturing one of the confusional spells may be helpful.
