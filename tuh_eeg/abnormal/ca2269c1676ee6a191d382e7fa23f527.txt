CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old male with frequent episodes of left sided tingling without loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG includes a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is a small amount of theta. As the patient becomes drowsy, the theta becomes more prominent. Vertex waves, spindles and posts are observed in stage 2 sleep. Hyperventilation produces a small of slowing. Photic stimulation does not elicit a driving response.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is mildly abnormal due to:
1. Mild excess theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. The excess theta described above may be due to this patient's medications.
