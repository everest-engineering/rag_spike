CLINICAL HISTORY:  Episodes of left eye twitching, stiffness of the right arm lasting hours, multiple normal MRIs and normal neurological examination.
MEDICATIONS:  Celexa, lisinopril, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  Technical considerations were within limits, although T1 and T2 impedances were slightly above 5 kilohms.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz 40 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta.  Features in drowsiness include an increase in beta, as well as slow rolling eye movements.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for muscle artifact and photic electric artifact with scant driving.
Heart rate:  66 BPM
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in the EEG.
