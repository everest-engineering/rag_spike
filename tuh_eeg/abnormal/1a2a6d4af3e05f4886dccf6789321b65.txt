CLINICAL HISTORY:  42 year old right handed woman with life long migraine headaches, now with an early morning headache with lightheadedness and dry mouth, but without visual phenomenon.  In addition, the patient has complex migraine, which begins as an aura of a bad smell, bad taste, then headache with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.  Previous MRI scan of the brain was normal.  Severe insomnia.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Elavil
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  Mu activity, as well as lambda was identified. The patient appears to be very sleepy, transitions in and out of stage II sleep.  Spindle activity is noted.  There seem to be fragments of sleep spindles just as she is dropping almost in and out wakefulness.  As the sleep record continues, more abundant stage II sleep is identified, but in the transition in and out of stage II sleep, there are fragments of early drowsiness, almost emerging into a stage II sleep pattern. The patient is awakened at the end of the test and answers complex questions. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:   66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Somewhat unusual, but normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no epileptiform features, but there are multiple normal variants, including mu and rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness. Given the transitions noted early in the record between wakefulness and stage II sleep, an underlying sleep deficit may account for this.  If there is any other question, a follow up study when the patient has had adequate sleep may be of value.
