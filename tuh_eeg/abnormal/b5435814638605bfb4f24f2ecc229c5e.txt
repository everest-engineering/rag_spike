HISTORY: 54 year old right handed female with a history of what may have been lupus cerebritis in 2006, complex partial seizures as well as other events which may be behavioral in nature.

MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Celexa, ASA

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 microvolts with a small amount of l ow voltage frontocentral beta activity. A small amount of background theta Is noted which attenuates when the patient is stimulated. Hyperventilation produces an increase in background theta. Drowsiness follows hyperventilation and is characterized by anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and, at times, in the transition toward drowsiness, a record that is well-organized without excess theta. Vertex waves are observed In stage I sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. The patient seems to be a bit drowsy and even during photic stimulation transitions Into sleep.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are sections of the record that are well-organized without excess theta. In some sections of the record, the patient appears to be excessively sleepy. These findings may have a correlation with the intermittent theta noted in the background. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat study is suggested but this study today had no focal features and no temporal epileptiform activities in contrast to other studies.
