CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old woman with seizure. The patient had a transient loss of consciousness, followed by postictal convulsion. Noncompliant with diabetes medications.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Aspirin, Simvastatin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed. This is a
postictal recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximal wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The patient is drowsy with an increase in theta noted.
The background EEG demonstrates frequent bursts of frontally predominantly 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity. There is some head rocking artifact, but the spike and wave activity is typically high amplitude, frontally predominantly with bursts lasting less than 2 seconds, and ranges from 3 to 3.5 Hz.
The patient is falling asleep with photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response at faster flash frequencies. There is also some spike and wave activity noted In photic, which is somewhat slower, more compatible with a drowsy pattern than a photic paroxysmal response. Other features to suggest that the patient is falling asleep In photic stimulation include vertex waves and spindles.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity.
2. Some polyspike and wave activity.
3. Mild background slowing compatible with postictal state.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is most consistent with an inheritance mechanism for seizures. Because there is a small degree of background slowing in this still postictal adult, a follow up study In the lab may be of value.
