REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 44-year-old man with history of hypertension and diabetes who presents with witnessed seizures described as generalized tonic-clonic seizures and postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include antihypertensive medication.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using a standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrode and 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  This tracing captured wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 8.5-9 Hz in frequency 30-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontal central beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  No epileptiform activities or seizures are identified during this recording.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG and does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are of clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
