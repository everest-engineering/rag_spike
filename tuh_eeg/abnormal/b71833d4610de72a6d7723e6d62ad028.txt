REASON FOR STUDY:  New onset seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old man with history of new onset seizures on Friday while at work.  He was walking over to the truck, stood, stare, fell, and had a generalized tonic clonic seizures with loss of consciousness and woke up in the ambulance.  He has a history of Percocet abuse.  He had not slept the night before and drank 2 energy drinks that morning.  He has a history of anxiety.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamotrigine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is no normal frontal central beta.  Activating procedures produce no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded only in wakefulness.
Seizures:  None.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
Note:  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. A repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep, may help in elucidating the diagnosis.
