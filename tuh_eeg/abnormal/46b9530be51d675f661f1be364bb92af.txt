REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status, probable seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 52-year-old lady presents with change in mental status.  She had a seizure in the ED with left upper extremity shaking, right eye twitching, unresponsiveness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, dementia, dyslipidemia, depression, right thalamic stroke, ambulatory dysfunction, hirsutism.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, aspirin, Lipitor, metoprolol, insulin, Protonix.
INTRODUCTION:  The digital video EEG was performed in the lab using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS:  There was a problem with the EKG leads throughout the study.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background is diffusely slow in the theta and delta range.  No posterior dominant rhythm was appreciated.
No clear distinction between sleep and wakefulness could be made on the EEG.
Photic stimulation was performed which did not bring about a change in the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Bifrontal slowing in the delta range was noted almost continuously.  The slowing was more prominent in the F3 and F4 regions.
There were rare F4 sharp waves seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Bifrontal F3 and F4 continuous focal slowing.
Rare F4 sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with a diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures arising from the right frontal region.  The bifrontal slowing indicates a possible underlying structural abnormality in these areas.  Clinical correlation recommended.
