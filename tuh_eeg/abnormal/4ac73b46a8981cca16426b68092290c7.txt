CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old right handed male with post traumatic epilepsy, last seizure 2 weeks ago withÂ·incontinence and tongue-biting during sleep. Co-morbid depression.

MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Valium, Prozac.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz, 60 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low. voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of frontal slowing. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 80 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to a previous study of September 6, 2007. Additional EEG recording or the use of special electrodes may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
