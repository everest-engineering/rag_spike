CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old right handed male with epilepsy, stroke, past seizures in 2008.

MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Plavix, Insulin, Prochlorperazine, Acetaminophen, Amlodipine, Metoprolol Tartrate, Bisacodyl, Phenytoin, Simvastatin, Ferrous Sodium, Docusate Sodium, Prochlorperazine Maleate, Inzo Zinc Oxide, Humulin. Flomax

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is sitting up in a chair leaning forward. He is quite somnolent.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is quite disorganized with primarily a theta frequency pattern. There is prominent, shifting arrhythmic delta activity and no well defined alpha rhythm. There is a bit more arrhythmic delta activity seen in some occasions in the right posterior quadrant. Photic stimulation does not activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized by a transition from theta to more of a delta pattern.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to:
1. Relatively marked generalized slowing.
2. Shifting slowing a bit more so on the right compared to the left.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. In comparison to the 2008 study, this EEG shows more significant background slowing. No sharp waves were seen today and only a single sharp wave was seen on the left in the first EEG.
