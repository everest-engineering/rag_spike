for the last 7 months. Past history of stroke with mild left hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS: Depakote, Norvasc, Avalide, Naproxen, Plavix, ISOSORBIDE,
Divalproex, Amlodipine, Enalapril
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There are no previous EEGs for
comparison. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized
with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 64 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features noted in the
record. The generous beta described above is a normal finding.
