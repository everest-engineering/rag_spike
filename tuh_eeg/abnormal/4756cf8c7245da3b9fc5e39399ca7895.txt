CLINICAL HISTORY:  41 year old left handed male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, left stroke with right-sided weakness, and episodes of sudden generalized weakness, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, and slurring words.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Keppra.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Possible seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen intermittently at F7/T3 with an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
