CLINICAL HISTORY:  46 year old right handed male, hypertension, neuropathic pain, recently evaluated at Jefferson Hospital for seizures.  Topamax was increased to 150 mg b.i.d., producing pins and needles in the legs.
MEDICATIONS:  Neurontin, Topamax, Prilosec, Procardia, Paxil, Naprosyn.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized, a relatively low voltage pattern with 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta and an increase in beta followed by post.  Low voltage frontocentral spindles are noted in stage 2 sleep. Hypoventilation increases the amplitude of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was drifting off to sleep but scant driving response was noted.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  Comparison with this patient's more recent EEGs may be helpful to localize the patient's underlying sharp wave focus.
