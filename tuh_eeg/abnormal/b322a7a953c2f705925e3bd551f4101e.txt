CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old male with epilepsy, seizure free for the last 4 years.  Previous EEGs.  He has hearing impairment and attention deficit disorder.  At age 15 he had 2.5 Hz spike and wave activity on an outside EEG, but by age 17 his EEG had become normal.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates an appropriate pattern for a young adult of this age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 90 mV.  The alpha rhythm is sometimes a little higher amplitude on the left compared to the right.
Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Posterior slow waves of youth were noted in wakefulness.  Although deeper stages of sleep were not achieved, just as the patient was becoming drowsy there seems to be some subtle underlying 4-5 Hz theta in the left occipital region.
Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicited a bilateral driving response.
Heart:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  A very subtle abnormality was noted in this EEG just as the patient was becoming drowsy and included some focal theta in the left occipital parietal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  For this individual with a history of early developmental pathology and possible meningitis, these findings may relate to that premorbid process.  The findings were seen in a very
restricted section of the EEG.  If there is any questions, additional EEG recording may be of value.
