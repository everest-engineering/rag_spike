LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 26-year-old woman with a longstanding history of seizures, now with increased seizure frequency for the last approximately month and a half.  Seizures are described as general tonic-clonic convulsions associated with occasional tongue biting, lethargy and self-injury.
MEDICATIONS:  Include Keppra, Tegretol and Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of moderate amplitude 8.5 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is no anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Excess beta is present throughout the recording.  During brief drowsiness, increase in diffuse beta activity is captured.  Hyperventilation does not produce significant change in the background.  Photic stimulation at multiple flash frequencies results in bilateral symmetrical driving at the medium-to-high range flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and briefly drowsy 22-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges are captured.  However, stage 2 sleep is not recorded.  If clinical suspicion for epilepsy persists, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be seen as a result of medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
