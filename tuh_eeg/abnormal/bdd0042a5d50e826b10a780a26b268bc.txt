CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed woman with a syncopal event recently and a past history of childhood seizures.

MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background is somewhat low amplitude but there is an 11 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. There is generous artifact observed in the frontalis region with the frontal electrodes. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous bilateral driving. Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha and an increase in beta.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. No features of this individual's childhood epilepsy were identified.
