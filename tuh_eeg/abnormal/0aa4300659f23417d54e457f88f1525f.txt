CLINICAL HISTORY: 18 year old with excessive jerking in sleep, evaluate for restless
leg syndrome.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a 10.5 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of
low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in
amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Drowsiness is
characterized by slow rolling eye movements with the appearance of vertex waves in sleep.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. A normal EEG is
typically found in restless leg syndrome. If periodic leg movements of sleep are
suspected, a polysomnogram might be beneficial.
