TYPE OF STUDY:  Routine EEG capture wakefulness and drowsiness.
DIAGNOSIS:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 28-year-old left-handed man, presents with history of seizures, started 7 years ago.  He had been seizure free for 2 years.  He noted increase in seizure frequency recently attributed to increasing stress at job.  His episodes are described as grand mal seizures.  His last seizure was 09/17/2012.
MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Depakote.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in lab using the standard international 10-20 system of electrode placement in addition to 1 channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness through drowsiness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 10 Hz in frequency 30-40 microvolt in amplitude seen the occipital region which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background activity.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies resulting in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
