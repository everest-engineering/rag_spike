CLINICAL HISTORY: 30-year-old male with a past traumatic brain Injury, gunshot wound to the head, development of epilepsy and severe headaches. Seizures occur 2 to 3 times per year, last In February.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, tramadol and Naprosyn, no recent opiate use.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is noted to have multiple cranial defect Including F8 and in the left hemisphere. Impedances are acceptable aside from T1-T2. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG from the right hemisphere is unremarkable with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and generous, frontocentral beta activity. There is a scant amount of theta.
The left hemisphere demonstrates a prominent breach rhythm with head rocking artifact disruption of faster frequency activity in the frontal regions. and a epileptiform discharge which is typically maximum at T5, sometimes C3 in the context of a breach rhythm.
Hyperventilation was performed early in the record, accentuating the focal slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm and again accentuation of focal slowing this time at C3-
P3. Photic stimulation was performed while the patient Is drifting off to sleep and elicited scant driving.
Heart rate 4 BPM.
IMPRESSION: This Is an abnormal EEG clue to:
1. Essentially continuous focal slowing in the left hemisphere with variable maximum and different
features including attenuation of the faster frequency activity in the left frontotemporal region, and
more posterior slowing in sleep.
2. In the context of a breach rhythm subtle sharp waves at T5 and P3.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are congruent with a structural functional process on the left. The right hemisphere Is relatively unremarkable. No seizures were recorded. At this time, previous
EEGs were not available for comparison.
