CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 79-year-old woman with a past history of stroke in 1980.  She recalls that stroke as face twisting with generalized weakness. She had an episode on February 1 characterized by generalized weakness, dysarthria and states she was amnestic for the event yesterday.  CAT scan showed no evidence of new stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Minor electrode problems were noted in the right temporal electrodes.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes an 8.7 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and occasional bursts of frontal delta.
Sleep was not sustained.
Hyperventilation was not feasible.  Photic stimulation elicited scant driving.
Heart rate was 78.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits for age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. In this individual with stroke, there were no strongly lateralizing features.
