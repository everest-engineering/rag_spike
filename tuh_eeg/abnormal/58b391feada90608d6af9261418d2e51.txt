REASON FOR STUDY:  A 51-year-old man with depression presents after possible seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 51-year-old man with history of depression presents after an episode of seizure, found on the floor.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine, lorazepam, and Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and sleep, stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There was a continuously seen overriding 60 Hz artifact which is eliminated partly with the notch filter, however, presents clear identification of all the wave forms in the EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz when awake and has some frontal central beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I and stage II sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None clearly seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Limited normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This limited EEG in wakefulness and sleep is normal, however, note that the overriding artifact required a notch filter to be used for review of the EEG and all the wave forms cannot be clearly identified as factual. Repeated EEG addressing this issue may be helpful if the clinical diagnosis or epilepsy and seizures is a concern.
