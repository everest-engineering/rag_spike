CLINICAL HISTORY:  54 year old right handed female with a history of refractory epilepsy, seizure free until she was switched to generic Tegretol.  Neuronal migrational disorder and psychiatric history.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Risperidone, Paxil, Proamatine.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Evaluation for seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recording during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to weak pattern, well-defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9-10 Hz with 15 microvolt amplitude which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal frontocentral beta.  The patient appears to go into the stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation will induce high amplitude alpha rhythm indicative of drowsiness and also the photic stimulation elicits supraharmonic alpha driving, but no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsiness EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the EEG does not exclude the possibility of seizures.
