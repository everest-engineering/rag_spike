CLINICAL HISTORY: 29 year old right handed male with refractory epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome, rare, early morning seizures none serious at this time.

MEDICATIONS: Carbatrol, Zonisamide.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is cooperative.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern. There are brief sections of the record where the EEG is medium amplitude, reasonably well organized with a 6 hertz background. This is disrupted by bursts of rhythmic, frontally predominant delta. In addition, there is arrhythmic delta activity sometimes identified in the occipital scalp region. There are shifting asymmetries but some of the arrhythmic delta activity is higher amplitude on the left compared to the right. Within the bursts of delta, there are subtle, slow, frontal spike and slow wave complexes. The epileptiform activity is not as prominent as the frontal delta. Hyperventilation produces prominent bursts of delta. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly abnormal background.
2. Frontal spike and slow wave activity.
3. Occipital delta.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings are similar to previous studies. No clinical seizures  were identified.
