CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed male with past history of seizure-like episodes, none recently.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an sleep deprived EEG, awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In sleep, there is a beta frequency background with occasional vertex waves. In wakefulness, there is a 12Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation produces bilateral driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION; This is the second normal EEG for this individual. If the patient is thought to have epilepsy, a more prolonged study may be helpful. Alternatively capturing one of his spells may be appropriate.
