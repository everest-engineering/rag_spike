CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed woman with episodes which are described as spasms. They include eye fluttering, head rocking and crying. Her brother and her child both have epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient had one of her behavioral events during the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric, 11 Hz, 70 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces a great deal of blinking. Brief drowsiness is characterized by a small amount of theta and some bursts of rhythmic, hypnagogic hypersynchrony. Photic stimulation elicits abundant, symmetric driving. The patient has an event during photic stimulation characterized by frequent eye blink. The eye blink frequency increases after the photic stimulation stops. She has shaking of her legs and impaired responsiveness. This is followed by moaning. No epileptiform features are associated with these behaviors. The EEG demonstrates a normal awake pattern throughout these behaviors which began at 11:44. unfortunately, the camera is primarily on her face and upper body and this is the lower extremity activity. Afterward, the patient has intermittent arm shaking noted at 11:47, again difficult to see on the camera. Afterward she feels drained and tired but the EEG continues to demonstrate a normal awake pattern.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second EEG for this individual. During both EEGs, the patient had behaviors characteristic of nonepileptic seizures with characteristic behavior, crying in the absence of epileptiform activity.
