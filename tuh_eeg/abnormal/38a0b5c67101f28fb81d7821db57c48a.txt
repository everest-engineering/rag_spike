CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 14
characterized by tonic-clonic seizures in sleep but with an episode of staring in August
2009.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz alpha with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Stage I sleep includes an increase in beta followed by vertex waves. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation produces a small increase in the amplitude of the background.
HR:	72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are seen.  In this individual with epilepsy, a more prolonged study capturing more extensive sleep may be helpful to identify epileptiform activity, and the beta may be due to anxiety.
