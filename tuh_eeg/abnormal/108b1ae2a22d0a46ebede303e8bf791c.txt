LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year-old gentleman who had a seizure yesterday in the setting of severe tachycardia and desaturation to a pulse ox of 35.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan given yesterday, citalopram.
INTRODUCTION:
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is asleep throughout the majority of the EEG.  During very brief wakefulness, there is a posterior dominant rhythm of 8.5 Hz with anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Throughout the majority of the study, the patient is asleep with vertex waves, sleep spindles, and POSTS seen.  Also, REM sleep is observed by the end of the recording.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  No epileptiform discharges were observed.
FINDINGS:  Primarily asleep study to REM sleep at the end of the recording.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal primarily asleep and briefly awake EEG due to excessive drowsiness and REM sleep captured on a 22-minute study.  These findings indicate excessive drowsiness.  In a routine EEG, a finding of REM sleep is abnormal.  In a proper clinical setting, further investigation to causes of excessive sleepiness may be considered.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not exclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
