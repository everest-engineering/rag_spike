CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed female with heart failure and a confusional episode as well as chronic right leg weakness.

MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Ultram, ASA, Warfarin, Nifedipine, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Protonix

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The patient transitions easily into a drowsy state with an increase in theta and beta.

HR: 55 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing in the Lab may be considered.
