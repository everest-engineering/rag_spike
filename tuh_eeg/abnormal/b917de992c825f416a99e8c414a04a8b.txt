CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed woman, with epilepsy, limited historian.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Depakote, Geodon, Hydroxyzine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a well defined 10 Hz, 40
microvolt, posterior dominant rhythm with a modest amount of low voltage frontal central
beta. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record increasing the amplitude off the
background, as well as increasing the beta and theta. Features of drowsiness include
anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If needed, a follow up study either capturing
one of her spells or capturing additional sleep may be helpful to characterize
epileptiform activity.
