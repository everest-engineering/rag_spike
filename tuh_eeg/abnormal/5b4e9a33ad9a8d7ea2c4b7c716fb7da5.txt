CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of seizures for 10 years.  She describes the seizures of 4 kinds.  Recently she has been having episodes of abnormal eye movements, followed by loss of consciousness that occur every 4 days.  She also has a history of generalized tonic clonic convulsions that were nocturnal, as well as panic attacks.  Past medical history is notable for bipolar disorder, insomnia, drug abuse, and fibromyalgia.
MEDICATIONS:  Mirtazapine, hydroxyzine, and inhalers.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Both hypoventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of polymorphic moderate amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Both slow and fast alpha variant are captured.  Diffuse excess beta is observed.
During sleep symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transient of sleep) are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces mild diffuse background slowing.
Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  No focal slowing or epileptiform discharges are captured.  A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
Fast and slow alpha variant.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 25-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
