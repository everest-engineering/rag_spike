REASON FOR STUDY:  Falls and loss of consciousness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 72-year-old man with a history of frequent falls since May 14, 2013, and losing consciousness.  He was at a bus stop and hit his head. He was dizzy prior to the fall.
MEDICATIONS:  Meclizine, lovastatin, amlodipine, metoprolol, and Prevacid.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
HEART RATE:  72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
