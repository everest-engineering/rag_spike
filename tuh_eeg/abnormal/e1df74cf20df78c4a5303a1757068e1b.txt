MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Metformin, Metoprolol, ASA, Lisinopril.
REASON FOR STUDY:  The patient had recurrence and 3 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures with prolonged postictal confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with 1 channel EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and sleep were recorded.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens with a generalized slowing and shifting slowing seen throughout the record.  The patient has, at times, detectable alpha rhythm in the range of 9 Hz.  No obvious seizure activity was seen in the record.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  The patient had generalized slowing and shifting slowing.  No epileptiform discharges were seen.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slowing.
Drifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen; however, consider a diffuse process that manifests with generalized slowing and shifting slowing.
