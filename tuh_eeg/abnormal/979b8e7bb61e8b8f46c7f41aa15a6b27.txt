CLINICAL HISTORY:  77 year old right handed woman with lifelong history of unusual migraine, diagnosed with complex partial epilepsy in 2005 with left temporal periodic sharp waves at that time, multiple medical problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Nasonex, Lipitor, Zetia, Nexium, Synthroid, Diovan, HCTZ, Prednisone, Hycodan, Symbicort, Spiriva, Delsym, Tassal (?)
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well-defined 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  In relaxed wakefulness, discernable from her eye movement artifact there is some very subtle rhythmic 3-4 Hz left temporal theta.  This is apparent in relaxed wakefulness.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral scant driving.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the alpha rhythm with more of a theta background.  Other features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.
HR:    78 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
A scant amount of left temporal theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Over the years, most EEGs for this adult have been normal.  The last time well-defined sharp waves were seen was when the epilepsy was diagnosed.
