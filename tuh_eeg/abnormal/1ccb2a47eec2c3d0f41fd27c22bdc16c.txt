CONDITIONS OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to standard 10/20 system with additional T1-T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a chief complaint of slurred speech and left-sided weakness, the patient initially felt severe headache with associated head heaviness.  The patient has dizzy and syncopal episodes.  Medications include Toradol, insulin, aspirin, Zoloft, topiramate, Lovenox and ciprofloxacin.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated low to moderate amplitude, 9 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuated, bursts of theta and delta are captured, symmetrical vertex waves and sleep spindles are observed.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation results in minimal symmetrical occipital driving.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a regular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 22- minute EEG.  Lack of epileptiform discharges does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
