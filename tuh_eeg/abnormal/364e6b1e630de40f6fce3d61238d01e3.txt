LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was performed.  Photic stimulation was not performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 37-year-old man admitted on 05/14/2013 for loss of consciousness and generalized weakness.
MEDICATIONS:  Toradol, Percocet, oxycodone, Zofran, acyclovir.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9 to 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Acute theta is present, and symmetrical vertex waves are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed with fair effort and produces no significant changes in the background.  Photic stimulation was not performed.
A regular heart rate is noted on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
