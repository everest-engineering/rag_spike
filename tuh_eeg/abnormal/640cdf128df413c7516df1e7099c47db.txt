CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed male with recurrent syncope, loss of awareness for 20 to 30 seconds, recurrent over 2 to 3 years. Last episode was August 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Xalatan, Amlodipine
Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.3 Hz alpha rhythm with
a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by
slowing of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
Hypersynchronous, rhythmic slowing is noted as the patient transitions into deeper
stages of sleep and then the patient is alerted for photic stimulation. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. This
individual has some hypersynchronous slowing with brief epochs which can be seen in
a sleep-deprived individual or an individual who is drifting off to sleep and then is stimulated.
