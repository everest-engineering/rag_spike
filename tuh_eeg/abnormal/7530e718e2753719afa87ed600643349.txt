LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 53-year-old woman with past medical history for 17 years, with last seizures in May and June, with associated generalized convulsion and urinary incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote and phenobarbital.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and no clear anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During maximal wakefulness, the background consists of somewhat monomorphic moderate amplitude 8 Hz theta activity admixed with polymorphic delta activity.  During periods of quiescence, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), bursts of delta, and periods of possible brief slow-wave sleep are captured.  Frequent bursts of variable lengths of polymorphic sharply contoured theta and delta activity are captured.  This slowing is multifocal, but most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and does not result in additional abnormalities.  Step photic stimulation does not result in significant change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
Bursts of multifocal slowing, often sharply contoured, most pronounced over the left temporal region.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute awake and asleep electroencephalogram due to mild to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization and multifocal bursts of sharply contoured slowing, most pronounced over the left temporal region.  Diffuse slowing and disorganization indicates etiologically a nonspecific diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  No clear epileptiform discharges were identified.
