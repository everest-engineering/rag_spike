LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man brought after having 2 witnessed episodes of generalized tonic/clonic convulsions.  The patient received Versed and Ativan.
MEDICATIONS:
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  During maximal wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient that is less well preserved over the left hemisphere.  Intermittent polymorphic theta and delta activity are captured over the left frontal/anterior temporal region.  Additional faster frequencies are captured over the left frontal leads.  During sleep, vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes are captured.  Sleep architecture is more pronounced over the left hemisphere.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.

FINDINGS:
Intermittent focal moderate slowing over the left frontal/anterior temporal region.
Breach artifact over the left anterior temporal/frontal central region.
Prominence of sleep architecture over the left hemisphere.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute awake and asleep EEG due to intermittent moderate focal slowing over the left anterior temporal/frontal region.  This finding indicates underlying cerebral dysfunction that could be structural in etiology.  Breach artifact indicates a defect in the skull.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
