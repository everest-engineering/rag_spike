CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed male with stroke, epilepsy, head trauma, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, admitted with prolonged postictal encephalopathy, confusion, incontinence, and aggressive behavior.
MEDICATIONS:  Lactulose, Lovenox, Lisinopril, Thiamine, Keppra
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is awake.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there are sections of the record that are pretty well organized with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There are prominent bursts of shifting, right or left temporal delta, and rhythmic theta.  Sharp waves are noted, including at T2 and T4. There are also some spikes with a somewhat unusual field of spread or with a horizontal dipole noted in a T1 and then F8 lateralization. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta.  As the patient transitions into sleep, a breech rhythm is noted with a bit higher amplitude beta in the frontal regions, more so on the right. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of rhythmic slowing noted from the right or left temporal region.
Rhythmic right temporal focal slowing.
A handful of sharp waves on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures were recorded.  This EEG demonstrates a bihemispheric process.  If localization of this patient's epilepsy is needed, a long term monitoring study may be of value.
