INTRODUCTION:
PROCEDURE
A routine EEG was performed using the 10/20 standard electrode placement system along with anterior temporal and EKG
electrodes. Wakefulness and stage 1 sleep were recorded. Activation procedures with photic stimulation were performed.
MEDICATIONS:
None.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:
None.
HISTORY:
A 26-year-old woman with complaints of dizziness with lower extremity weakness in March 2011 and an episode of loss of
consciousness and fall in August of 2011 diagnosed with vertigo and inner ear infection.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:
The EEG opens to a posterior dominant rhythm at 9 to 10 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 70 microvolts. Normal frontal
central beta is seen. Sleep is characterized by stage 1. Alleviation procedures included photic stimulation, which revealed
no abnormal discharges. No hyperventilation was performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
None.
SEIZURES:
None.
IMPRESSION:
Abnormal EEG awake and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:
This is a normal EEG. No seizures or epileptiform activity were seen. Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude
the diagnosis of epilepsy. Further recording with deeper stages of sleep and prolonged recording may be helpful in
eliciting epileptiform discharges.
