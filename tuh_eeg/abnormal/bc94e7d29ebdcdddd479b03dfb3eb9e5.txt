CLINICAL HISTORY: Pseudo seizures and severe psychiatric disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Depakote, Haldol, Thorazine, Geodon and Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  Drowsiness is characterized by a prominent increase in beta.  In stage II sleep, there is prominent beta spindles and posts.  K complexes were also noted.
Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record.  Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage II sleep and did not alert the patient.
Heart rate 90 BMP.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is remarkable for generous beta, but is otherwise normal in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
Clinical correlation:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  The generous beta may be due to this patient's medications.  In comparison with this patient's previous EEG recordings which were utilized to make a diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures may be of value.
