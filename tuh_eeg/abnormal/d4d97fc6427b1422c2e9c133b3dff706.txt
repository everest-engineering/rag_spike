LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  20 minutes and 26 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 64-year-old man with a past medical history of a stroke in 2002, epilepsy, headaches, diabetes and dementia.  The patient's seizures are described as loss of consciousness associated with shaking, aggression and confusion.  Last seizure was approximately 1 year ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications:  Vimpat, Keppra, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.    Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude 9 Hz alpha that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and diffuse theta appears.  No Stage II sleep is recorded.  Occasional bursts of polymorphic moderate amplitude theta and delta are captured over the left temporal region.  At times the slowing appears to be sharply contoured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Step photic stimulation results in no change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Mild to moderate focal left temporal slowing.
No epileptiform discharges.
No Stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21 minute awake and drowsy EEG due to mild to moderate occasional left temporal slowing.  This finding indicates focal dysfunction over the left temporal region, that could be structural in etiology.  No clear epileptiform discharges are captured, however, Stage II sleep is not recorded.  If clinical indication for epilepsy persists a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
