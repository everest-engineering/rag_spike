CLINICAL HISTORY: 24 year old right handed female with headaches that last for 3-4 days with vomiting, bifrontal pain.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 Hz alpha rhythm, which is high amplitude with posterior slow waves viewed. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing, followed by vertex waves and POSTS. There are rare bursts of hyposynchronous theta. Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing and an increase in amplitude and scant hyposynchronous slowing.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
