CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 80-year-old male with adult onset epilepsy and dementia, patient had multiple seizures this morning including 5 seizures and then a tonic-clonic seizure in the emergency room.  Seizures typically occur with dehydration but not exclusively so.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Depakote, glyburide, lisinopril, others.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Patient was very confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is markedly slow and low voltage.  With arousals, a low voltage theta pattern was identified.  As the patient drifts in and out of sleep, there is some bursts of some shifting slowing and some muscle artifact.
Heart rate irregular 117 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to replacement of normal background with a low voltage flow pattern.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the third EEG without epileptiform activity for this adult.  The current pattern is compatible with a post ictal or pharmacologic pattern with a low voltage flow pattern.
