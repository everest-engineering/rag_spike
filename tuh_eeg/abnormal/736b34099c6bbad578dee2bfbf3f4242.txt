CLINICAL HISTORY:  An 87-year-old woman status post fall with pelvic fracture and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, digoxin, Lovenox, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  The patient is restless and confused.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Despite the muscle and movement artifact, this is overall a technically satisfactory EEG.  There is a glimpse of a 9 Hz alpha rhythm noted on the left or right with some shifting asymmetries.  Shifting slowing was noted, a bit more prominently on the right than the left.  With arrhythmic delta activity.  Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements.
Heart rate irregular 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Shifting slowing with more prominent arrhythmic delta activity and disruption of faster frequency activity on the right compared to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with a subarachnoid hemorrhage on the left cistern, no epileptiform features were seen.  Focal features were somewhat more prominent on the right compared to the left.
