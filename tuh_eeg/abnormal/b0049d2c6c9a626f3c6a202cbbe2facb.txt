CLINICAL HISTORY:  81 year old female with a history of right a MCA stroke as well as 79% right carotid stenosis who presents preoperative for a right carotid endarterectomy.
MEDICATIONS:  Pitavastatin, Plavix, Spiriva, Ambien, ASA, Fenofibrate, Lisinopril, Calcium carbonate, Indapamide.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Right carotid endarterectomy.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement with the additional of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Then record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of  frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and posed no abnormal discharges, but a nice photic driving response was seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F7/T3 as well as F8/T4, slightly more on the left than the right at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to the previous stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
