.CLINICAL HISTORY:  72 year old right handed man with a change in mental status and forced right gaze deviation with upper and lower extremity shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lasix, Hydralazine, Minocycline, Fentanyl
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status with right gaze and upper and lower extremity shaking.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some temporal artifact over the left hemisphere.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz.  There is increased amount of beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  Some sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at F3 frequently throughout the recording sometimes with a larger field at C3, T3.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left frontal and rarely centroparietal sharp waves.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left frontal region or possibly the left centroparietal region.  No seizures were seen.
