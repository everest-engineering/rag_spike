CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old left handed woman with history of seizures and postictal confusion.  Last seizure on January 16, 2012.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lamictal.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some multiple electrode muscle and impedance artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta seen.  The patient achieves sleep stages 1 and 2. Activating procedures, including photic stimulation and hyperventilation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:      None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and sleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy. Repeat recording with deeper stages of sleep may aid in confirming diagnosis.
