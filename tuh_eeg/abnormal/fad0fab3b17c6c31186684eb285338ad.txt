CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old male with paroxysmal episodes which can be
triggered by a hot beverage characterized by repetitive sneezing, confusion, weakness,
sweating and even loss of consciousness.

MEDICATIONS: None.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
10.7 hertz alpha rhythm of 40 microvolts with a small amount of low voltage,
frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing
with vertex were in stage 1 sleep followed by arousals. Hyperventilation increases the
amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits supraharmonic driving.

HR: 68 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If there are any concerns, a repeat
study capturing one of his paroxysmal sneezing spells is suggested.
