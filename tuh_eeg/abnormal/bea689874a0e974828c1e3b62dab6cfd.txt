CLINICAL HISTORY: 67 year old female with refractory epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Dilantin, Bactrim, Sinemet, ASA, Protonix, Lovenox,
Levothyroxine, Labetalol, Clonazepam

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is relatively
somnolent and seems to be posturing the right arm.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a theta
frequency pattern, which at times is more attenuated on the left compared to the right
There is a 6.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with some shifting arrhythmic delta activity
in the temporal regions. The patient Is awake and intermittently moving about. As the
recording continues, the most prominent area with attenuation of faster frequency
activity is the left temporal region.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Superimposed slowing from the left hemisphere maximum in the temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of
cerebral function, but with the greatest impact in the left temporal region.
