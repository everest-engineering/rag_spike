CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed woman with possible seizure
characterized by episodes with loss of balance, loss of speech, slurred speech, memory impairment, but no incontinence. The last episode was April 30, 2011.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 7 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. With testing, the posterior dominant rhythm remains somewhat slow at 6-7 Hz. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record. It produces some head rocking, but a suggestion of right posterior slowing. Lambda waves are noted in wakefulness. Features of stage 1 sleep include an increase in beta, POSTS, and then spindles in
stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting in and out of stage 2 sleep. There is no significant driving response.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing with a slow alpha rhythm.
2. Question of a focal hyperventilation response with a subtle of focal slowing on the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The head rocking artifact of hyperventilation makes the focal features a bit more difficult to interpret. The alpha rhythm is slow in this individual. Medications or a mild diffuse disturbance of cerebral function can contribute to slowing of the alpha rhythm.
