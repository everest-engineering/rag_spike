LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Twenty-two minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 52-year-old woman with history of hypertension, depression, seizures, hypothyroidism, and migraines.  Now presents with transient change in mental status that has since resolved.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include aspirin, amlodipine, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix, Celexa, Lovenox.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG
lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of a well-formed and modulated 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During brief drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of theta are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.
A single EKG lead demonstrates a regular heart rate.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute electroencephalogram.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, staged sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
