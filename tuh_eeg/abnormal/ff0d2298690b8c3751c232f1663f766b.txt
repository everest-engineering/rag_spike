CLINICAL HISTORY: 51 year old right handed woman with 5-6 year history complex partial and tonic clonic seizures. The patient has evidenced that she is not aware of and has intermittent memory impairment. She also reported a new event with numbness in her hands and difficulty walking.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal, Gabapentin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The EEG demonstrates a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces a small amount of theta. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed today. This EEG contrasts to other studies which have identified some background theta. Either excess background theta or some temporal theta.
