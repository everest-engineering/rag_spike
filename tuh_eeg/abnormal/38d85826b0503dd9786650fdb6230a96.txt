CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old male with a confusional episode following exposure
to an MRI and gadolinium.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are completed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-organized 10Hz, 40
microvolts posterior dominant rhythm. produces a small amount of
background theta. left temporal region than right. In relaxed wakefulness, there is
a very subtle asymmetry, again with very subtle isolated underlying theta in the left
temporal region. Scant driving response is noted.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle, isolated 4 to 6 Hz theta identified in the left temporal region with, at this
point, either isolated slowing or, in hyperventilation, a little bit more slowing on
the left than the right.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to previous studies, this is a markedly
improved EEG and the focal features on the left have substantially improved .
