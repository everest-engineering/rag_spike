LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 33-year-old woman with 2 year history of spells of unclear etiology.  The spells are associated with initial metallic taste in her mouth and an overwhelming sensation of burning followed by loss of consciousness and generalized shaking with associated tongue biting and urinary incontinence as well as postictal confusion.  These events can last up to an hour.  The last such event was on 01/15/2013.
MEDICATIONS:  Current medications include Depakote, Klonopin and others.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with addition T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of  well-formed and modulated 9-10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies with lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is observed throughout the recording.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of diffuse theta are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no change in the background. Stepped photic stimulation results in no additionally abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep maybe of benefit.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effect, such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
