CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old female with epilepsy, seizure free for 2 years, follow
up EEG.

MEDICATIONS: None

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is 9.9 alpha rhythm. There
seems to be a breech rhythm with accentuation of amplitude in the right occipital region.
Vertex waves and POSTS are noted in stage 1 sleep with spindles in stage 2 sleep,
with right occipital delta. Hyperventilation increases the amplitude. Photic stimulation
elicits driving.

HR: 80 bpm

IMPRESSION: Very mild abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal delta on right occipital lesion.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG did not identity any sharp waves or spikes. The
focal delta in amplitude and asymmetry can be seen in the context of a structural
abnormality. Clinical correlation is suggested.
