CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old gentleman who developed seizures 2 years ago characterized by headaches, sweating, vomiting and then loss of consciousness and post ictal confusion lasting days.  He has had 3 of these spells in 2 years.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Impedances were acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized.  There is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with prominent temporal wicket.  In addition to the wicket, hyperventilation produces a  small amount of intermittent, isolated focal slowing in the temporal regions, left more so than the right.  Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with harmonic and super harmonic driving.
Heart rate:  55 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a very mildly abnormal electroencephalogram due to:
Subtle left temporal focal slowing.
A small amount of shifting temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no definitive epileptiform features noted in this EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged tracing capturing sleep or the use of special electrodes may be of value.  The temporal features described above are nonspecific.
