CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old female with intermittent episodes of change in speech for the last 6 months. Previous episode of loss of consciousness, dizziness and shakiness.

MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, Singulair, Advair, Lisinopril

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is an 11 Hz, 40 mcV posterior alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving response.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed. If this patient's language disorder is thought to be a seizure, a repeat study capturing one of her spells might be appropriate.
