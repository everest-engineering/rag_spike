system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.7 hertz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Vertex waves, K
complexes, spindles and posts are noted in stage II sleep. Photic stimulation is
performed while the patient is in stage II sleep, but does elicit a driving response.
