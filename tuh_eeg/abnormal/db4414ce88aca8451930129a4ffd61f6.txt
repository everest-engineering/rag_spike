CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old left handed man with a history of syncope versus seizures, who presents with episodes of shaking for 10 minutes with loss of consciousness with no bowel or bladder incontinence.  No record of events.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontal central beta.  Activating procedures, which included photic stimulation, revealed no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in drowsiness only.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen frequently at F8/T4 with an amplitude of 20-60 mV at a frequency of 2-4 Hz.  At times it become monomorphic, but not clearly rhythmic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Right anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  A repeat EEG with capturing sleep may be helpful in elucidating the diagnosis.
