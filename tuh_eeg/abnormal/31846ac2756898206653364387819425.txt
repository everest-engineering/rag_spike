INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient had continuous eye movement artifact throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a low amplitude, but well-defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10-11 Hz and appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is a diffuse amount of frontocentral beta which is excessive.  The patient does not go into sleep, but appears to be drowsy.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and drowsy EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that the excessive beta sometimes can be seen due to medication effect.
