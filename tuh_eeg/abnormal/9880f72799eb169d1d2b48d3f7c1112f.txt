LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  29 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 23-year-old man with a history of headaches and dizziness for 2 days as well as slight tremors.
MEDICATIONS:  Oxycodone, lorazepam, Tylenol, and Lovenox.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 11 to 11.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at low amplitudes anteriorly.  Excess diffuse beta is captured.  During sleep there are symmetrical and vertex waves, sleep spindles and K complexes were observed.   Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in mild diffuse background slowing.  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in any change in the background.
FINDINGS:
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 29 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The excess beta could be secondary to medication effects such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
