CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old left handed male with a 5-minute episode of unresponsiveness, eye blinking and stiffening. History hypertension, asthma, head injury and a remote history of epilepsy and substance abuse.

MEDICATIONS: Unknown.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed. This is an awake record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a low voltage, relatively slow pattern with a 6 Hertz alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation results in frequent eye blinking but no pathological features. The patient is noted to have frequent eye blinking at other times, again without epileptiform activity.

HR: 90 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: These are non-specific features. Consider toxic-metabolic or bi-hemispheric disturbance.
