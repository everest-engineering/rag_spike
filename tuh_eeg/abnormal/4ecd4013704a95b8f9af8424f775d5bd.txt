REASON FOR STUDY:
CLINICAL HISTORY:
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves at T3 and independently at T4 seen frequently throughout the recording at frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.  At times, this focal slowing can be very suspiciously sharply contoured, especially over the right hemisphere, but not clearly epileptic.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due intermittent independent bilateral midtemporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction seen independently in both midtemporal regions, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  Please note that at times some of the slowing, especially on the right side, was suspiciously sharply contoured and a repeated recording with __________ for the
deeper stage of sleep may help in elucidating more clear diagnosis.  No seizures were seen.
