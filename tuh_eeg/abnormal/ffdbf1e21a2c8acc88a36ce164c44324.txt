REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old woman with history of left parasagittal meningioma, status post resection and craniotomy with history of focal seizures with right arm trembling.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, amlodipine, Prilosec, Colace, Allegra, Zocor, atenolol, folic acid, hydrochlorothiazide, loratadine, and Omega III.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10-11 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta, slightly seen more over the left hemisphere than the right.
Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
Abnormal discharges:  Focal slow waves seen at C3/CZ continuously throughout the recording with a frequency of 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 mV with an associated increase in faster frequencies consistent with a breach rhythm.
Seizures:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left central focal slowing and breach.  At times it is sharply contoured.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left central region, which is consistent with a known meningioma resection.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were clearly seen.
