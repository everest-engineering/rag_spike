CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed male with recurrent right focal seizures and right-sided numbness with new left parietal lesion on CT.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Lipitor, Gemfibrozil, Protonix, Lorazepam
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient has not been having any seizures but is continuing to experience left-sided numbness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with an alpha rhythm of 9 Hz, 40 microvolts.  There is generous frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in rhythmic slowing.  Vertex waves and posts are observed after the patient transitions to stage II sleep.  K complexes are noted.  Hyperventilation produces minimal slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation is performed as the patient is drifting off to sleep.  Scant driving is noted and is essentially symmetric.
HR:    72 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
