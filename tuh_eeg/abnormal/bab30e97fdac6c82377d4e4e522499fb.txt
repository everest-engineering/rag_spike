CLINICAL HISTORY:  48 year old right handed man with epilepsy and hypertension.  Seizures described as loss of consciousness and generalized shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Chlorthalidone, Motrin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta.  Features of drowsiness included increase in beta and theta.  Hyperventilation produces head rocking.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were observed.  There were no definitive focal features.  To more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of use.
