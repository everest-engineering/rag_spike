CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old right handed woman with childhood epilepsy,
recurrent seizures following cerebral malaria, now seizure free, but occasional nocturnal
incontinence.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a 10.5 Hz 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount of
low voltage, frontal central beta. Brief drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of the
alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. During photic stimulation frequent blink artifact
is noted, but there are no epileptiform features.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
