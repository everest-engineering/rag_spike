REASON FOR STUDY:  Hypothermia protocol.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 70-year-old man status post PEA code on August 26, 2013, down for 30 minutes, now on hypothermia protocol.  Past medical history of hypertension, CHF, and obstructive sleep apnea.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Versed drip, Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive and sedated.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no real posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  There is an absence of normal electrocerebral activity.  No variability or reactivity was noted in the EEG.  No normal sleep architecture was seen.
Abnormal discharges:  Lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
Heart rate 78 with frequent PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to lack of normal electrocerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction with lack of normal electrocerebral activity.  In this case, due to hypothermia protocol, it may be due to sedatives and medication effect.  No seizures were clearly seen.
