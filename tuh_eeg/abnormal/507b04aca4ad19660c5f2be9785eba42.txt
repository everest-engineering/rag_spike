INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is 11 Hz alpha rhythm. The overall record is appropriately organized for age. Features of drowsiness include increased background slowing with vertex waves in sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude in the background. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were observed and the normal developmental milestones for a child of this age including hypnagogic hypersynchrony were observed.
