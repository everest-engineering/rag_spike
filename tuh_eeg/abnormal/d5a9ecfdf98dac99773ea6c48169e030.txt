CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old woman who was status post left intracerebral hemorrhage due to head trauma, ocular blinking.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Labetalol, Keppra, Dilantin, Hydralazine, Pantoprazole, Lovenox, Insulin, Maxipime
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is trached and has very slow periodic eye blinking.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a pattern with beta. There is somewhat periodic sharply contoured activities at T6-02, which is in the delta frequency range, but the periodic eye blink occurs approximately 5 seconds and does not seem to correlate with the epileptiform activity in the occipital region. Stimulation of the patient produces an increase in theta frequency activity.
HR: 100 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
2. Right occipital periodic sharp waves.
3. Eye blinks which occur less than once per 5 seconds and do not correlate with epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral function affecting gray and white matter. The eye movement does not exactly correlate with EEG and maybe clinically evaluated.
