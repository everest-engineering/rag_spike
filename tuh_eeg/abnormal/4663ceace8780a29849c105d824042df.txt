CLINICAL HISTORY:	28 year old woman with multiple events in the clinic today admitted with episode of unresponsiveness  and mutism.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:   Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic simulation are preformed.  The patient is awake and cooperative.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a well defined 9.3 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage fronto-central beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by the appearance of rhythmic theta.
HR: 	90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are observed in this record. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. Of note, this record was
recorded immediately after this patient's multiple and prolonged events. Hence, not only were the behaviors unusual for seizures, but there was no postictal slowing.
