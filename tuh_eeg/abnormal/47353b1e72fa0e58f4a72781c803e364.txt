CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old right handed female with a past medical history seizures, migraines, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.  Past history of vague seizures.  She presented with a loss of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  The patient stated she had a lot of similar episodes last year but none this year yet.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Albuterol, Lamictal, Flovent, Zyrtec, Prednisone
REASON FOR STUDY:  Possible new onset seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and stage I and II sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  The patient has a lot of hair weaves and electrodes may not be accurate.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 to 10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening bilaterally.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta seen diffusely throughout the recording.  The patient appears to go into stage I and II sleep, and that has been recording by showing posts and K-complexes throughout the recordings.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the possibility of clinical seizures.
