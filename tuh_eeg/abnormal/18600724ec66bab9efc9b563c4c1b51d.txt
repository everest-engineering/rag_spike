CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old woman with asthma and 3 seizures in December 2012 characterized by blacking out while driving.
MEDICATIONS:
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Five minutes hyperventilation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, this is a very useful appearing EEG with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 80 microvolts with prominent, posterior slow waves of youth.
Hyperventilation was performed early on the record producing bursts of rhythmic, synchronous theta and delta again with a slight posterior predominance.  Following hyperventilation, as the patient became drowsy, hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing was identified.  Other features of sleep include vertex waves and multiple transitions in and out of sleep.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response with harmonic and supra harmonic driving.  In addition, on occasion during photic stimulation, the patient was becoming drowsy with bursts of paroxysmal slowing, but without definitive spike and slow wave activity.
Heart rate 78 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits for a young adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG.  There are multiple, youthful findings noted in this EEG, but no pathological features were noted.
The previous EEG demonstrated some of these same youthful findings, but raised some concern as to possible underlying spike and wave activity.
