CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed woman with meningioma resection 2
years ago, anxiety, vertigo, and headaches. The patient had an episode on May 11,
2011 characterized by vertigo, left sided went numb, was nauseated with pain in the left
head and back, and elevated blood pressure.
MEDICATIONS: Two medications for anxiety attacks (names unknown).
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.
There is head rocking artifact primarily picked up in the left temporalis region. Features
of drowsiness include rhythmic background slowing. POSTS are observed in stage 1
sleep. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude, as well as an increase in
beta. Brief vertex waves and brief stage 2 sleep is observed. Photic stimulation elicits
scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There is some head rocking on the left, but there are no
definitive epileptiform features. Prior EEGs identified focal slowing, none was seen
today.
