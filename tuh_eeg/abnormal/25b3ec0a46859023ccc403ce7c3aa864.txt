CLINICAL HISTORY:  45 year old right handed woman with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, seizure free for many years.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 11 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Both drowsiness and hyperventilation are characterized by an increase in theta with some paroxysmal bursts of theta.  There is also some left temporal 5 Hz activity picked up in hyperventilation with a characteristic morphology of rhythmic midtemporal theta of drowsiness.  Similar waveforms are seen on rare occasion on the right.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep.  Deeper stages of sleep are not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving with harmonic and supraharmonic driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No generalized spike and wave activity was noted.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In this particular epilepsy
syndrome, this normal EEG pattern, with absence of epileptiform activity in an adult is quite common.
