CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 19-year-old right-handed woman with epilepsy since age 13, patient had difficulty recalling or describing seizures.  Last seizures include loss of consciousness and postictal confusion.  Date of last seizure unclear.  Currently 5 months' pregnant.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient transitions in and out of sleep with vertex waves and spindles.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If additional information is needed, a follow-up study capturing more prolonged sleep or comparison with this patient's childhood EEGs may be of value.
