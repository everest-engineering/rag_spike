LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 35-year-old woman who presents with a history of seizures status post trauma at the age of 21.  The seizures occur mostly during sleep.  The seizures are characterized as first a sensation of dizziness followed by loss of consciousness with associated postictal confusion and tongue biting.  The seizures are currently becoming more frequent, occurring every week.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta activity is observed.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, bursts of theta and central beta are captured.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy nearly 23 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical suspicion for  seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep maybe of benefit. Excess beta could be secondary to medications such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
