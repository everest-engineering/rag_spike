CLINICAL HISTORY: 88 year old right handed male with possible seizures, evaluate for fugue states. An 88-year-old retired airspace engineer with states, Parkinson disease, pacemaker.

MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Famotidine, Sinemet, Atenolol, ASA, Pravastatin, Amlodipine, Plavix, Finasteride, Flomax

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is well organized with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive. Central mu activity is noted, but testing is not performed to confirm this. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background. Vertex waves are noted in sleep as are K complexes and spindles. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: This EEG is normal for an adult of this age.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are a handful of bursts of shifting slowing in the transition to sleep but none outside the range of normal. No epileptiform features were seen.
