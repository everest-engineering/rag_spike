CLINICAL HISTORY:  69 year old right handed woman here for preop for an aortic arch replacement.
MEDICATIONS:  Ciloxan, Metoprolol, Augmentin, Citalopram, Lexapro
REASON FOR STUDY:  Preop for aortic arch operation.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontocentral beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness. Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at F8/T4 frequently and much less frequently at F7/T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral (right more than left) anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral anterior temporal regions (right more than left), which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
