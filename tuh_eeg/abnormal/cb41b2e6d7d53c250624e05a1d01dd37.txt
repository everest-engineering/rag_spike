CLINICAL HISTORY: 65 year old woman status post left intracerebral hemorrhage and
subdural hematoma requiring craniotomy. She is postoperative day 4.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Serax, Ativan, Gentamicin, Thiamine, Folate Acid
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and is in a hard collar.
Prominent craniotomy defect is noted on the left. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the background EEG is low voltage
with rhythmic theta frequency activity of 6 Hz, reaching 50 to 60 microvolts followed by a lower
voltage more attenuated pattern. Intermittently there is some prominent increase in beta. Later
sections of the record are remarkable for occipitally predominant delta which is of different
frequencies, a little bit faster on the right compared to the left. There is some muscle and
movement artifact but as the movement artifact slows, there is a right frontocentral small
discrete sharp and more of a right parieto-occipital periodic sharp seen intermittently in the
record. These findings and this pattern differs substantially from the initial sections of the record.
They are also associated with richer overall background.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Pattern with generalized background slowing alternating with more of an irregular pattern
with posterior sharp waves or periodic delta.
2. Posterior periodic complexes or sharp waves.
3. Intermittent background attenuation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance of cerebral dysfunction.
Of note, while the majority of this patient's trauma is on the left, it is likely that the seizures are
emanating from the right hemisphere given the clinical description of ictal left gaze deviation and
the epileptiform features reported.
