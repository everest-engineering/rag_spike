CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old female with refractory epilepsy with recent cloudy thinking after a seizure and fall.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonisamide, Prilosec, Vimpat, Nortriptyline, Temazepam, Cyclobenzaprine, Omeprazole
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is disorganized.  There is a posterior dominant rhythm of approximately 6-7 Hz.  There is prominent background theta.  In this high amplitude, very sharply contoured background, there are a handful of sharp waves in the left mid to anterior temporal region.  There is also a single sharp wave in the right anterior temporal region.  Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
In this sharply contoured record, there are occasional sharp waves noted and these are primarily on the left.
Shifting slowing particularly in the right posterior quadrant.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In this individual with an abnormal baseline there may be an increase in background slowing and disorganization although this harder to assess
without direct comparison.  No seizures were recorded.  No specific hallmarks of a hepatic encephalopathy were identified.
