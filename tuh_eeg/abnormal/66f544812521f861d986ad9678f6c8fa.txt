CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old right handed woman with prior right MCA infarct, left hemiparesis and now with epilepsy. Most recent seizure was April 29 without loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed,
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat disorganized. There is a posterior dominant rhythm identified of approximately 8 Hz. It is somewhat disrupted on the right compared to the left. There is a small amount of shifting slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic background slowing. There are also some posts noted. Significant muscle artifact is noted at the T4 electrode.
There are a handful of bursts of sharply contoured slowing in the right centrotemporal region.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal EEG due to
1. Mild background slowing characterized by the excess theta.
2. Some focal slowing in the right central region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are artifacts in this record and hence there are no definitive sharp waves. If further characterization of this patient's underlying epileptiform focus is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested. Thank you.
