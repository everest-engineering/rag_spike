REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 31-year-old woman presents with a history of a feeling of a strange burning smell and déjà vu lasting for seconds.  At times it occurs more than once a day.  The last event was in March of 2013.  Past medical history is significant for possible febrile seizures at age 2 and was on Dilantin and Tegretol in the past.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 system with the addition of anterior temporal single EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a light amount of excessive  frontocentral beta.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation were performed.  Hyperventilation produced normal generalized slowing and photic stimulation had nice photic driving.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal sharp waves seen frequently at F7/T3 in wakefulness and sleep.
Focal slow waves seen almost continuously at F7/T3 throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to left anterior temporal focal sharp waves as well as focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization-related epilepsy with seizures arising from the left anterior temporal region.  In addition, there is evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction in that region which has high correlation with a structural lesion in that region.  No seizures were seen.
