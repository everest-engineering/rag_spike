CLINICAL HISTORY: 84 year old right handed woman with hypercoagulable state,
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, and syncope.

MEDICATIONS: Norvasc, Coumadin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well.organized with a 9 Hz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye
movements and increase in beta and some rhythmic central theta. Photic stimulation
does not significantly activate the record.

HR: 48 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG for an adult of this age but bradycardia.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. A normal EEG
does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration,
a follow-up study is suggested.
