REASON FOR STUDY:  Status post hypoxic injury, brain dead protocol.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 43-year-old woman who presents with status post cardiac arrest on 08/09/2013, down for an unknown amount of time with positive crack and heroin, who was found in pulseless electrical activity, and a head CT revealing diffuse cerebral edema.
MEDICATIONS:  Vancomycin, norepinephrine, desmopressin, Tylenol, and famotidine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG using the brain dead protocol was used using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes in a brain dead protocol fashion were used to review this EEG.  The patient was recorded while comatose.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some EKG artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reviewed based on a brain dead protocol at 2 microvolt sensitivity reveals no normal cerebral activity and lack of normal brain architecture.  There is no posterior dominant rhythm, no frontal central beta, absence of any sleep architecture, and no activating procedures were performed.  The patient did have stimulation and no reactivity or variability were seen.  Electrodes were checked by the technician during the recording.  This study lasted a totality of 53 minutes.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  No normal electrical cerebral activity.
SEIZURES:  None.
Heart rate is 96.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to the lack of any normal electrical cerebral activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with electrical cerebral findings and in the right clinical scenario is consistent with brain death.  These findings were communicated to the primary team.
