CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old male with epilepsy since age 6, recent 4 seizures in a row. Typical seizures are tonic clonic with postictal confusion.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm which is symmetric and reactive and a small amount of 11 Hz activity noted in the background bilaterally. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of alpha rhythm and disruption of the alpha rhythm. Notable findings in this record include sharply contoured delta or bursts of rhythmic frontal sharply contoured theta in the right frontal region typically at F8 or T2, reaching amplitudes up to 80 microvolts. While there are no definitive sharp and slow wave complexes, in some cases this is simply because of the duration of the discharge, not the actual morphology. Hyperventilation and drowsiness seem to accentuate this finding. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving at faster flash frequencies.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Sharply contoured rhythmic, delta in the right frontal temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: Although there was some eye artifact noted in the record, the eye artifact can be excluded with the use of an average reference and there is clearly a focus in the right frontal temporal region which can be differentiated from the eye movement.
