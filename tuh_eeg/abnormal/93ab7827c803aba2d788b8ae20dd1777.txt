REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old man with history of alcohol abuse with new onset of focal seizures and right upper extremity shaking, eyes deviating to the left with increased seizure frequency.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A long term EEG was performed from October 20, 2012 to October 21, 2012 for 24-hours using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and obtundation.  The patient had no activating procedures performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The overall background is slow with a theta frequency and at times with bursts of intermittent beta bursts seen diffusely.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
Abnormal discharges:
Focal sharp waves seen almost continuously over the left hemisphere which appeared to have an initial maximal negativity at F7 and sometimes FP1.  However, this appears to travel centrally and posteriorly over the left hemisphere towards C3 and at times P3/T5.  These sharp waves are seen at a frequency of 1 to 2 Hz and at times have rhythmic runs, but do not clearly evolve.  The periodicity is consistent with periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLED's).
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV seen continuously throughout the recording.  Note:  Although there is marked diffuse slowing at times, the patient is stimulated and there appears to be reactivity with muscle artifact and slight increase in frequency.
Seizures:  None seen.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due left hemispheric anterior frontal temporal and central PLED's, in addition to generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization related epilepsy with seizures likely arising from the left hemisphere.  In addition, there is evidence of acute structural dysfunction and irritability in that same region.  Lastly, there is evidence of marked diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology, but may be due at least in part to medication effect.  No clear seizures were seen.
