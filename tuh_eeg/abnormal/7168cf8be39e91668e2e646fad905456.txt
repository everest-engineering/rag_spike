CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed woman with asthma and a first-ever seizure. Symptoms included feeling strange, then a feeling in her legs, off balance with loss of consciousness followed by 2-minute tonic/clonic seizure and postictal confusion.
This event occurred on June 14.
MEDICATIONS: Lovenox, Hydralazine, ASA, Protonix

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation was completed. This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz 60 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Features of drowsiness include an increase in beta, some rhythmic frontocentral theta, and intermittent attenuation of the alpha. Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is d rifting off to sleep. In addition to posts, there also appears to be a driving response. The patient does wake up for the 13 Hz stimulation.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through brief stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no focal nor epileptiform features identified. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
