CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed man with history of hypertension, recent seizures, and altered mental status.
MEDICATIONS:  Famotidine, Keppra, Tylenol, Hydralazine, Heparin, Labetalol.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures, included hyperventilation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal amount of frontal central beta.  Hyperventilation produces exacerbation of frontal delta which augments in the abnormal discharges.  No photic stimulation was performed.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Frontal intermittent rhythmic delta seen in bursts frequently throughout the recording which is accentuated by hyperventilation.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Bursts of FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
