CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old right handed male with status epilepticus earlier this morning status post 10 mg of Ativan, Dilantin, and Keppra. History of cervical myelopathy. Intubated and paralyzed prior to the EEG.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Ativan, Etomidate, Fentanyl, Versed, ROCURONIUM
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is starting to emerge from paralysis and demonstrates stiffening and movements.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is a bit quieter. Activity demonstrates a slow pattern with some rhythmic mixed theta and delta on the left with a lower voltage, slower, a bit more suppressed pattern on the right, particularly in the temporal regions.
Stimulation of the patient clearly produces an alerting with an increase in muscle as well as alpha and theta frequency activity. During the EEG, the patient starts to wake up, move around, and cough. After this, there is a more alert pattern with more theta frequency and alpha frequency activity from the left, but the right remains quite slow. By the end of the record in this very sharply contoured record, there was a suggestion of underlying sharp activity versus part of the fast activity at F3. In addition, more sharply contoured slowing is seen at T4-T6.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Nearly continuous focal slowing on the right hemisphere.
2. Occasional T4-T6 sharps and question F3 sharps as well.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe, bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function as would be expected following the use of sedative, hypnotic medications. The focal slowing and rare sharp waves on the right are compatible with past right temporal hemorrhage. Additional evaluation of this patient's cerebral function may be needed. Ongoing EEG monitoring was undertaken to make sure no additional seizures occurred.
