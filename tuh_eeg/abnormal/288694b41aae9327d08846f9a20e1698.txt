REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with seizures described as pain in the stomach, lightheadedness, foaming at the mouth, eyes rolled back, with a history of hypertension, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, anxiety, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS:  Q-Pap, clobetasol, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, simvastatin, ketamine, nystatin, omeprazole, metformin, Mobic, cyclobenzaprine, Zetia, citalopram, alprazolam, zolpidem.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Continuous eye blinking and fluttering artifact seen throughout the recording.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded in wakefulness.  Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  Note:  The patient continues to flutter her eyes throughout the entire recording, making it difficult to make any good description of the frontal patterns.
Abnormal discharges:  None.
Heart rate:  84.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
