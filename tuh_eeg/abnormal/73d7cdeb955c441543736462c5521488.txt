CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old woman with stroke 3 years ago, left-sided weakness and aphasia, now with stress, anxiety, and intermittent paresthesias on the left.
MEDICATIONS: Vitamins
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  The overall amplitude of the background is relatively low voltage.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements, followed by rhythmic central theta.  The patient transitions in and out of stage 1 sleep with vertex waves.  She is drifting into stage 1 sleep during photic stimulation, which does elicit a bilateral driving response.
Hyperventilation increases the amplitude of the background.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were noted in this EEG.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  In addition, despite the previous stroke, no focal features were seen.  If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged study capturing her clinical symptoms may be of value.
