CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 24-year-old woman recently diagnosed with epilepsy.  Four days ago she had an episode of shakes, nausea, vomiting, incontinent of bowel and seizure activity, evaluated in the emergency room.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Dilantin, Risperdal, Cogentin, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was completed.  Impedances were challenging.  The overall technical quality is acceptable.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is an 8.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Muscle artifact was noted in the frontal regions.
Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in beta with slow rolling eye movements.  Sleep was not sustained.  Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background.
Heart rate:  90 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep may be of value.
