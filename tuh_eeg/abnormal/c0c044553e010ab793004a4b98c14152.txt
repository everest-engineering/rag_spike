REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 39-year-old female with uncontrolled right hand shaking, as well as seizure disorder 20 years ago, follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, gabapentin, clorazepate, quetiapine, hydroxyzine, oxycodone, alprazolam, Ventolin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 8 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures produced no abnormal discharges.  In general, the background appears to be disorganized and appears to be polymorphic including bursts of delta that at times are more focal in the bilateral temporal regions and sometimes in the central regions.  Overall, the background is in the theta range of slowing 5-7 Hz, although at times it becomes even more slow at 2-4 Hz.  Patient does appear to have some normal sleep architecture in stage 1 sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz with intermittent bursts of 2-4 Hz diffuse delta.
Focal slowing in both F7/T3 and F8/T4 and at times more centrally at 2-4 Hz at an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to generalized slowing as well as independent bitemporal as well as some central focal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction seen independently in the bilateral temporal region as well as the central regions as well as generalized cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
