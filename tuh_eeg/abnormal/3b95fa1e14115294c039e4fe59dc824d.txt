REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 54-year-old man with history of strokes and heart attacks, and subsequently seizures, here for follow-up EEG.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, metoprolol, Plavix, lisinopril, pravastatin, amlodipine, allopurinol.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep, stage I/stage II.  Procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record reveals a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness, stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.  There is a nice prominent burst of rhythmic temporal theta of drowsiness seen intermittently.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  48 with some frequent premature ventricular complexes.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
