CLINICAL HISTORY: 43 year old right handed male with syncope, numbness,
paresthesias, recurrent loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.
Hyperventilation was omitted.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is asleep during much of the EEG. with
abundant stage II sleep, vertex, POSTS, K-complexes and spindles. There is excess
artifact but there also appears to be attenuation on the right. Multiple artifacts are noted
from the left occipital region which are not corrected during the EEG. Photic stimulation
is performed while the patient is asleep. Very little stimulation of the patient is performed
and this stimulation Is performed within the last few minutes of the test and does not
serve to alert the patient.
HR: 60bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG
CLINICAL This EEG include electrode artifact on the right as well as
an inability to adequately stimulate the patient. Consequently focal features may be
under recognized. In addition, additional testing to make sure that it is possible to record
an awake individual is necessary.
