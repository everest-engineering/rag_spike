CLINICAL HISTORY:  This 24-year-old lady with new onset seizures, which were characterized by loss of consciousness with convulsion.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement and one channel EKG.  Wakefulness and drowsiness were captured.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is bilateral posterior dominant rhythm at 10.5 Hz frequency, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a good anterior posterior gradient and muted them was noted in the central electrodes.
Drowsiness was captured, which was characterized by slow rolling eye movements and some slowing of the record.
Photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.  Hyperventilation did not elicit any abnormal activity.  It was characterized by diffuse slowing.
Photic stimulation was performed, which showed good driving at all frequencies.
Heart rate 64 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy EEG.
A normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy.  Clinical correlation recommended.
