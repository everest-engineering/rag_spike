CLINICAL HISTORY: Rare CPS since 2007. Currently seizure free.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.
Hyperventilation elicits a small amount of theta with a very slight asymmetry with a bit more on the left.
Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving with supra harmonic driving.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is at the limits of normal for an adult of this age.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this adult with a spell in 2007.  Of note, of all the EEGs she has had, only the 12/12/2011 EEG identified left anterior temporal sharp waves. The subtle findings noted in hyperventilation are not outside of the acceptable limits of normal, but the theta on the left is ipsilateral the previously defined sharp waves.
