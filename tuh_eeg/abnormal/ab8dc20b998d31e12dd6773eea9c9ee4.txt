CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old woman with migraine headache and dizziness.

MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Elmiron, Prilosec, Verapamil, Topamax, Sanctura,
Amitriptyline
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized with a relatively high amplitude 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early in the record and increases the amplitude of the background. In drowsiness, bursts of hypersynchronous slowing are observed. Photic stimulation elicits vigorous driving.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
