CLINICAL HISTORY: 49 year old right handed gentleman with 2 episodes of blurry vision with syncopal like symptoms and left PCA infarct. Syncope was attributed to the patient's hypoglycemia but focal features were noted on exam.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 7.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm. The overall background is slightly slow and there is a small degree of shifting slowing in the posterior regions. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background slowing.
2. Rare shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were seen. In this individual with a history of an acute stroke, there was no significant left occipital slowing no acute distress no sharp waves.
