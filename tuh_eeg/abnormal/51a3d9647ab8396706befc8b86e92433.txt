CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old female with epilepsy since age 19, with nocturnal tonic-clonic seizures with incontinence, hypertension, hyperlipidemia. Seizures were related to an assault at age 19.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Gabapentin, Remeron
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.3 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing an increase in background theta. There are occasional bursts of paroxysmal rhythmic slowing noted as the patient transitions from hyperventilation into stage I sleep. Brief epochs of paroxysmal slowing are noted as she transitions into sleep with vertex waves. The pattern is overall most reminiscent of hypnagogic hypersynchrony but there is a suggestion of asynchrony in the bursts. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: This EEG is at the limits of normal.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The overall organization is acceptable. There is hypnagogic hypersynchrony which is at the limits of organization. In this individual with a history of epilepsy, additional EEG recordings may be valuable to delineate underlying epileptiform activity as well as to determine if there is an epileptiform discharge hidden in the hypnagogic hypersynchrony. Hypnagogic hypersynchrony, however, is a normal finding.
