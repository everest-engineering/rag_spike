CLINICAL HISTORY: 39 year old woman who had recent repair of lateral meniscus tear and an episode postoperatively of head deviation to the right and paroxysms for a few minutes with confusion. The patient has a history of VP shunt, blindness, and past seizure disorder.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the postoperative care unit using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient initially appears to be still sedated postoperatively.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a drowsy individual with a lower voltage, slower pattern. As she awakens, an 11 Hz alpha rhythm is identified bilaterally. Artifact is seen on the right compatible with prior craniotomy. As the recording continues, the patient is increasingly awake.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The initial sections of the record demonstrate a sedated pattern compatible with acute postoperative state, but by the end the patient is awake and there are no pathologic findings. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study in the lab maybe of use.
