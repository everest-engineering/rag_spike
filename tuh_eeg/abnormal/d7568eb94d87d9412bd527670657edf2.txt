LENGTH OF RECORDING:  23 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with history of alcohol abuse.  She had an episode concerning for alcohol withdrawal seizure versus a nonprovoked seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Condition of the recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated low amplitude 10-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Frequent bifrontal EMG artifact is present.  There is excess diffuse beta.  No sleep is captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical driving at medium to high flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake, only 23-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizure persists, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit. Excess beta could be secondary to medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
