CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed man with past medical history of diabetes, epilepsy, that presents with frequent seizures with low Dilantin levels.  He was given Ativan and loaded with Dilantin.  Now with tremors in the upper extremities.  EEG to rule out seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
REASON FOR EEG:  Rule out seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using the 10-20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal electrodes and EKG electrodes.  The patient was lethargic to obtunded during the recording.  No sleep was recorded.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a generalized slow background in the delta frequencies with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  Activating procedures were not performed.  Stimulation causes increased muscle artifact, but no change in the frequency.  During the recording the patient is seen to have tremors, more in the right arm than the left arm, seen on the video which revealed no epileptiform EEG correlate, but only muscle artifact seen along with the tremor.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 mV seen continuously.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Low amplitude.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  The tremor noted in the video had no epileptiform or EEG correlate.  No seizure or epileptiform discharges were seen.
