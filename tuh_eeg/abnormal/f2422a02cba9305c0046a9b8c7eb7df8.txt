HISTORY: 24 year old right handed woman, recent vaginal delivery of an infant.
The patient had a syncopal spell and was transferred to another hospital. She awoke with
tongue biting. No other information available.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an 8.7 Hz 20 microvolt posterior
dominant rhythm. Drowsiness was characterized by an Increase In slowing with appearance of
vertex waves and posts. Hyperventilation produces bursts of higher amplitude paroxysmal
slowing. The patient falls asleep and then is awakened from photic stimulation. In photic
stimulation there are bursts of high amplitude, frontally predominant, 2.5 to 3 Hz activity. During
photic stimulation, the patient starts to drift off to sleep. There are, however, bursts of frontally
predominantly 2.5 to 3 Hz sharp and slow wave or spike and slow·wave complexes and these
seem to be accentuated by the photic stimulation.
HR: 78bpm
IMPRESSION: abnormal EEG due to:
2. Overall organization at the limits for age.
3. Question of underlying, frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: A follow up EEG may be helpful to more clearly evaluate a
potential underlying generalized spike and wave discharge. This phenomenon can be
· seen in individuals with inherited mechanism for epilepsy, but they can also be seen in those
who carry a genetic trait for the same phenomenon.
