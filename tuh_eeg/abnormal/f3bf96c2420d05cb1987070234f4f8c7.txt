CLINICAL HISTORY:  25 year old right handed male with refractory epilepsy, admitted last night following multiple seizures.  Seizures were characterized by turning of the head and jerking.  He received 4 mg of Ativan.
MEDICATIONS:  Ativan, Vimpat, Phenobarbital, Keppra, Zonisamide, Banzel, Clorazepate
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  The patient was able to complete hyperventilation.  He had a single event at the end of hyperventilation with head turning to the right and verbal unresponsiveness.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG demonstrates a slow and disorganized pattern with a posterior dominant rhythm of 5 Hz.  There is excess theta and a small amount of shifting asymmetry.  In apparent wakefulness, the patient seems to have vertex sharp waves.  After hyperventilation, at 1:12:25, the patient complains of feeling unwell and looks to the right.  He is verbally unresponsive.  The technologist called for the physician.  The patient had some bursts of paroxysmal central theta but no epileptiform activity is noted.  In addition, the patient is noted to have spontaneous, purposeful movements despite his inability to speak to the physicians or to more purposefully interact.
HR:    96 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Background disorganization.
What are likely vertex sharp waves with central sharply contoured theta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The behavior that was recorded today did not carry an EEG signature.  There were some subtle bursts suggestive of a posterior paroxysmal spike and slow wave but no definitive spike and slow wave activity was seen.  This is one of more than 30 EEGs for this individual.  This event differs from others in that there was no EEG signature for a patient who was not able to respond to external stimuli.
