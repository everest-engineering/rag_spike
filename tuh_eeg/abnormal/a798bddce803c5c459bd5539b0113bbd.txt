CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 41-year-old male with epilepsy since 1984,
characterized by an aura of tremulousness in his right finger followed by generalized
tonic-clonic activity and then 3 to 5 minutes of post ictal confusion. History of mental
illness.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well.organized with a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a generous amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude
of the background. Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in frontal theta.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. Heart rate 75 beats per minute.

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed and a
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If further information is needed, a
followup study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
