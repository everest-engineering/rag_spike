CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 59-year-old male with post traumatic epilepsy, frontal and bitemporal gliosis. Patient had multiple major motor seizures with elevated Tegretol level of 18, sedated with Ativan and Versed.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal, lisinopril, carbamazepine, Ativan, Versed, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed at the bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The patient is drowsy.  The background is diffusely slow with a mixture of delta and theta.  Stimulation of the patient produces eye movements and increase in delta.
The patient is initially not cooperating or not talking to the technologist.  As the recording continues, the patient is conversant despite a markedly slow background.
Heart rate:  104 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: Significant generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Previous EEGs were not available for comparison.  This EEG supports a severe bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function and may occur with a toxic or metabolic encephalopathy or postictal state.
