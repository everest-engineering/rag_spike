CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old, right handed woman with migraine headaches and a
seizure in August 2010, with fractured jaw. Since that time she has been having these
episodes with loss of time 1 to 2 times per day. There is a past medical history of
depression and gastric bypass.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Gabapentin, Topamax, Seroquel, Elavil
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is slow,
somewhat disorganized with a 7.8 Hz alpha rhythm. There are bursts of shifting
arrhythmic delta activity particularly in the temporal regions. These bursts are
accentuated by hyperventilation and drowsiness. There is a fair amount of
electrocardiogram artifact but no definitive sharp waves are noted. Photic stimulation
does not activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
2. Bursts of sharply contoured slowing and shifting arrhythmic delta activity
particularly in the right or left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There are no definitive sharp waves. A Followup study
capturing deeper stages of sleep may be helpful to identify an epileptiform activity
particularly in the temporal regions.
