CLINICAL HISTORY: 82 year old woman with dementia, new onset seizures and pain. Question right hemiparesis.
MEDICATIONS: None listed in chart
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is disorganized. There is a 6.8 Hertz alpha rhythm on the left and significantly slower rhythmic activity on the right. Bursts of FIRDA are noted and there are a handful of C4, F4 sharp waves noted. These findings are quite subtle, however. Features of drowsiness included increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is drifting off to sleep and does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 78 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Arrhythmic delta from the right.
3. Subtle frontal central sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function as well as a structural or function process on the right involving gray and white matter. Correlation with imaging given the focal epileptiform features is suggested.
