DATES OF STUDY:  May 30-31.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old male with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness, pacemaker, depression, bradycardia.
MEDICATIONS:  Depakote, Toradol, Xanax, oxycodone, others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  No clinical events were noted.  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm in a pattern rich in beta.  There is a small amount of background theta noted in wakefulness and a small degree of disorganization.  Drowsiness was characterized by an increase in background slowing and there are occasional bursts of shifting slowing as the patient becomes drowsy.  The patient remained in lighter stages of sleep overnight.  He was awake and sitting at the side of the bed at 4 a.m.  By 5 a.m., he was drifting into stage 1 sleep with POSTs.
Heart rate 84 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is a mildly abnormal EEG for age due to:
Intermittent excess theta.
Rare bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were seen.  This patient did not sleep very much during the long-term EEG monitoring session.  This may have represented difficulty sleeping with the electrodes, but he was up and awake throughout much of the record, raising the possibility of an underlying sleep disturbance.  A bit more sleep was captured in the baseline EEG.  An underlying sleep disturbance or a
disruption of the sleep-wake cycle or medications might all contribute to the sleep pattern described above.
