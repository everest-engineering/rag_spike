CLINICAL HISTORY: 59 year old right handed male with syncope and stroke in 2006.
MEDICATIONS: Diovan, Nystatin, Spiriva, Advair, Amlodipine
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 hertz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Drowsiness is characterized by
slow rolling eye movements with vertex waves and spindles in stage II sleep. Sleep is
not sustained. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. Normal
EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.
