CLINICAL HISTORY: 75 year old male with subacute infarct with recent status
epilepticus.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. The patient is comfortable, but relatively somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is abnormal and relatively
slow. There is a lower voltage in the theta and delta pattern on the right. In contrast, the
left has less faster frequency activity. Stimulation of the patient produces some faster
alpha and beta frequency activity on the right, but less so on the left. The patient is
restless. Shifting arrhythmic delta activity is observed. A critical team was called to
administer medications which do slow the heart rate, but this intervention does not
change the EEG. Photic stimulation does not activate the record.
HR: 150 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Lateral background slowing.
2. Asymmetry with slower pattern on the left compared to the right and disruption of
faster frequency activity on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In contrast to previous EEGs, no epileptiform features
were seen. This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function
affecting gray and white matter, the left more significantly than the right.
