CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed woman with right middle cerebral artery
CVA, syncope, visual complaints.
MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol, Norvasc, ASA, Zocor, Plavix, Neurontin, ISOSORBIDE,
LISINOPRIL, Heparin, Protonix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized. From the left hemisphere, there is a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm but
also some 7Hz to 10Hz activity. From the right hemisphere, there is disruption of the
alpha rhythm with focal slowing in the right posterior quadrant. Photic stimulation was
performed while the patient was drifting into stage II sleep and in stage II sleep,
asymmetric spindles were observed.
60bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1.
Focal slowing from the right posterior quadrant with disruption of faster frequency
activity.
2.
Mild background slowing on the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural abnormality on the right
No epileptiform features were noted.
