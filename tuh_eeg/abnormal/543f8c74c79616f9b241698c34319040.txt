CLINICAL HISTORY: 40 year old male with a history of head trauma. Rare early morning seizures typically associated with exhaustion and missing medications.

MEDICATIONS: Carbamazepine.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient reports he has not had a seizure since March.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hertz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record and produces sustained, rhythmic right frontotemporal 2-3 Hertz activity. Following this, as the patient drifts into sleep there are rare right anterior temporal sharp waves noted. The patient is awakened from sleep for photic stimulation which elicits a generally bilateral driving response which is relatively subtle but there is also rhythmic slowing and a handful of sharp waves noted during photic stimulation.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Rhythmic slowing in the right temporal region.
2. Rare right anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. Epileptiform activity was more prominent in the EEG in comparison to previous studies including a normal1-hour study in 2007 and an abnormal study in 2006.
