CLINICAL HISTORY:  34 year old woman with liver failure, long history of multiple body jolts with drop and loss of consciousness over the past 3-4 years.  The patient reports a single tonic clonic seizure after taking tramadol.  Scuba driving instruction license. Positive family history of epilepsy.  The patient previously on and off diazepam.  Symptoms alleviated with the use of diazepam.  Also history of anxiety and nervousness.
MEDICATIONS:  CellCept, Prograf, Prednisone, Valium,
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and a sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG includes excess theta.  There is an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is excess 6 Hz and 4 Hz activity noted in the background. Features of drowsiness include hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing with some vertex waves, spindles, and POSTS noted in stage II sleep.  Stage II sleep is better organized. There is some more paroxysmal, sharply contoured bursts at C4/T4, but without focal slowing.  There is no after going slow wave that accompanies these discharges. Hyperventilation produces paroxysmal rhythmic slowing. Photic stimulation elicits driving.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Excess theta.
Background disorganization.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  There are no definite sharp waves or spikes noted in this EEG.  The features described above in terms of C4/T4 focus may represent a normal variant, particularly if there is no after going slow wave which accompanies the discharges.  In this individual with a history of myoclonus and/or tonic clonic seizures, a follow EEG, perhaps in 1 hour with sleep, may be helpful to more fully evaluate this patient.
