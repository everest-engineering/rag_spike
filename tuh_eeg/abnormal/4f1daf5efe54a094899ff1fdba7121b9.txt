CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old male with panencephalitis at age 2, multiple seizures per week lasting seconds, myoclonic jerking, chronic static encephalopathy, urinary tract infection.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Primidone, Ranitidine, Oxybutynin, Baclofen, Mellaril, Valium, Diastat, Veramyst, Albuterol, Pulmicort

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is awake. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is slow and disorganized with rhythmic 3 Hz to 5 Hz activity. The overall shape of the cranium is markedly asymmetric and there is a previous ventriculostomy but there is also a sharp wave focus in the right central region which is quite prominent throughout the EEG. Lateral rectus eye movement artifact is also observed bilaterally. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.

HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent sharp waves from the right central region.
2. Bilateral background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a bihemispheric disturbance of cerebral function congruent with the imaging. The epileptiform activity emanates from the right.
