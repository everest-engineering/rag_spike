CLINICAL HISTORY: 55 year old left handed male admitted yesterday after 5 tonic
clonic seizures. Liver transplant patient.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tylenol, Cyclosporine, Lamictal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is significantly slow with a
mixture of theta and delta. There is a great deal of muscle artifact in the record. In addition, bursts of frontally predominant or generalized spike and slow waves are noted. Hyperventilation seems to accentuate the epileptiform activity, but in this challenging EEG, epileptiform activity is prominent and in fact, because of the muscle and other artifacts, sometimes, the after going slow wave is a little easier to define than the frontally predominant spike. Photic stimulation does not clearly activate the tracing.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Prominent generalized epileptiform activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to last week's EEG, this EEG is slower,
more disorganized and has more epileptiform activity.
