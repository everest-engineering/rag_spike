LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Approximately 22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 66-year-old man who has a history of a TIA about 2 to 3 weeks ago.  The episode was described as approximately 1 minute of speech slurring.  He denies any weakness or loss of consciousness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension.
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and medications for hypertension.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening. There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates, bursts of diffuse theta and delta are observed, and vertex waves are captured.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequency.  Occasional heart rate with fewer than 60 beats per minute is captured in a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
