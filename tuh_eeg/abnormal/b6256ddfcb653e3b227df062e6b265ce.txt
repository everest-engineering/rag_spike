CLINICAL HISTORY: 31 year old right handed male with episodic chills, dizziness,
nausea. Last event was 2 months ago.
MEDICATIONS: Amitriptyline
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized
with symmetric reactive 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm and a small amount
of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the
record and produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation
elicits bilateral driving. Brief sleep is characterized by posts and vertex waves.
HR: 75 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are identified. A normal
EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
