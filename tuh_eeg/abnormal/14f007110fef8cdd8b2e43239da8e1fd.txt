CLINICAL HISTORY: 50 year old right handed male with TB, meningitis, and
nonadherent with medicines admitted with declining mental status, left hemiparesis, and
seizures.
Depakote, Rifampin, Isoniazid, Pyridoxine, Pyrazinamide,
Ethambutol, Protonix, lovenox, Zocor, lisinopril, ASA, Simethicone, Dilantin,
Metoprolol, Valproate
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG Is quite abnormal. On rare
occasions, there is a glimpse of a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm in the posterior regions, but
much of the record includes a rhythmic theta and delta. There are prominent bursts of
rhythmic theta and delta most prominent from the right frontal region but present
bilaterally. In addition, there is a bit slower arrhythmic delta activity in the right
frontal region in comparison to the left. The patient is awake throughout much of the
record. There are a handful of sharp waves noted in the right frontal region.
HR: 120 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent bursts of frontal slowing, right greater than the left
2. Generalized background slowing.
3. Rare sharp waves in the right frontocentral region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No seizures were recorded. This remains a markedly
abnormal EEG.
