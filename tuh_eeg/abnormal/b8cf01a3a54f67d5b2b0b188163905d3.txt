CLINICAL HISTORY:  51 year old right handed male with a stroke, left hemiparesis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.  The patient was admitted with acute and chronic renal failure and left leg shaking.
MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, at times there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The background is intermittently disrupted by generalized background slowing.  As the patient transitions in and out of sleep, there is a subtle asymmetry with disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right.   Photic stimulation elicits bilateral slowing.
HR:    90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent bursts of generalized focal slowing.
Occasional disruption of the alpha rhythm on the right relative to the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is more supportive of a metabolic process.  The subtle focal features may be correlated with imaging.
