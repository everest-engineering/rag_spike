CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old right handed woman with right temporal
hemorrhage, headache since November 2009 but no seizures.

MEDICATIONS: Keppra

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Photic stimulation is performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well-defined posterior
dominant rhythm of 8.3 Hz. There is a small interhemispheric asymmetry with a bit
more delta activity in the right temporal region compared to the left. This is better
identified with the use of mapping software than is visually apparent. Photic stimulation
elicits scant driving.

HR: 96bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Subtle asymmetry with subtle delta in the right temporal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. The focal delta
described above is an anticipated finding following intracerebral hemorrhage.
