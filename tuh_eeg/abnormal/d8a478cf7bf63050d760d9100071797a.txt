CLINICAL HISTORY: 62 year old right handed male with seizure like spells August
2009 characterized by eyes open, shaking lasting seconds. Throat cancer, coughing
and supplemental oxygen requirements.
MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Pilocarpine, Diovan, Simvastatin, Dilantin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation was not
performed, but photic simulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with a low voltage of 9 hertz alpha rhythm .and a generous amount of low
voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta.
In the transition to drowsiness, there is some shifting slowing particularly in the right
central region. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. There is some
occasional age related shifting slowing in drowsiness, but none outside of the limits of
normal. This is the patient's second EEG without epileptiform activity. If there are strong
concerns about seizures, a more prolonged sleep EEG or an overnight recording may
be of use. The shifting and slowing identified in drowsiness is a nonspecific finding and
can be seen in the context of underlying cerebrovascular disease or simply as a normal
finding in a senior citizen.
