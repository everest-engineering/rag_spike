CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old right handed male with epilepsy characterized by epilepsy with seizures for the last 7 years, last hospitalized 14 months ago for 3 months. No recent seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient was quite thirsty and was drinking water during the hyperventilation section of the EEG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9.7 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. The overall amplitude of the EEG is low voltage. The patient transitions in and out of stage I sleep with vertex waves and spindles. Electrode artifact at T3P3 is noted. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. There is head rocking artifact noted.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is the second normal EEG for this patient this year. If additional information is needed. comparison with previous studies is suggested.
