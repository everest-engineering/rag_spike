MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
HISTORY:  A 52-year-old with Down syndrome and new onset tonic/clonic seizure in December 2012.  Seizure with loss of consciousness and incontinence.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 7 Hz alpha rhythm in a pattern with generous beta.  In apparent wakefulness, intermittent rhythmic theta was noted.  In addition to this theta, there are intermittent burst of somewhat irregular slowing noted bilaterally.
The patient transitioned in and out of sleep with vertex waves in snore arousals.
Photic stimulation was performed as the patient was drifting off to sleep and did produce a driving response at faster flash frequencies.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG for an adult of this age due to:
Slowing of the alpha rhythm.
Some unusual bursts of shifting slowing in sleep particularly in the central regions.
CLINICAL CORRELATIONS:  This patient seems to awaken frequently from sleep or has a fair amount of muscle artifact in sleep.  A more prolonged sleep record maybe helpful to search for epileptiform activity in this middle-aged adult with Down syndrome.  There are no previous EEGs available for comparison in term of the slow alpha rhythm for an adult of this age.
