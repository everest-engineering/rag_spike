LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a first-ever seizure on 7/11/2013.  Episode was characterized by eyes rolling backwards and shaking, lasting for approximately 5 minutes.  The patient felt dizzy upon arrival.
MEDICATIONS:  Prilosec and Flexeril.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consisted of well-formed and modulated 10 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior-to-posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at the lower amplitudes anteriorly.  Diffuse excess beta is present.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates.  Bursts of diffuse theta and delta are observed as well as __________ present over the left.  Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and results in no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving with multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
No stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indications for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage 2 may be of benefit.  Excess beta could be secondary to medication affect such a benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
