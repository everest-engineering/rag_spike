CLINICAL HISTORY: 63 year old female with refractory status epilepticus following stroke. Rectal carcinoma.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Zofran, Pantoprazole, Insulin, Vimpat
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and somnolent.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The left hemisphere includes a mixture of theta frequency activity with some arrhythmic delta activity and some beta. The right hemisphere demonstrates a relatively suppressed background particularly in the posterior temporal region. The frontocentral regions demonstrate some mixed frequency activity. The major abnormality in this record is a high amplitude left occipital spike and slow wave complex which is seen as frequently as 5 discharges in 20 seconds but sometimes is infrequently as only 2. This is a very high amplitude irritative focus but it no longer evolves.
HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Prominent high amplitude right occipital spike and slow wave complex.
2. Right occipital temporal suppression of cerebral activity.
3. Moderate background slowing from the left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is markedly improved and the patient is no longer having seizures and the epileptiform activity is isolated and it no longer revolves. These findings are congruent with the MRI which demonstrates a significant right TCA stroke.
