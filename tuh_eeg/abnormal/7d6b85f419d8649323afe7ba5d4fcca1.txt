REASON FOR STUDY:  Left-sided weakness.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This patient is a 57-year-old female with left-sided facial weakness, left facial droop, lupus, hypertension, discoid lupus, alcohol abuse, and history of intracranial bleed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
MEDICATIONS:  Cyclobenzaprine, Ambien, diltiazem, levothyroxine, and hydroxychloroquine.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens up with posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There was some frontocentral beta.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation which produced no abnormal discharges.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and stage I sleep.
Heart rate:  72 with some PACs.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow wave seen almost continuously over the left hemisphere at T3 at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 microvolts.  At times there is loss of faster frequencies noted over that region.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to left midtemporal focal slowing and loss of faster frequencies.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural cerebral dysfunction, which is consistent with a known hemorrhage in that region.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
