CLINICAL HISTORY: A 56-year-old male with epilepsy following cerebral thrombosis in childhood. Seizure free for the last 7 years. History of a skull defect.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol, Neurontin, Pravachol.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background includes a 10-Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is continuous skull defect at C3-T3 with higher amplitude activity in that region. Underlying this there is also a subtle disruption of faster frequency activity and some rhythmic focal slowing which is sharply contoured. There is also a subtle amount of slowing in the right.
Hyperventilation produces an accentuation of the rhythmic slowing in the left temporal region as well as bursts of rhythmic generalized slowing. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. In drowsiness the focal slowing is more prominent in the left midtemporal region.
Photic stimulation elicits driving which is best identified on the right but is relatively
subtle.
Heart rate 72 BPM.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Focal slowing from the left.
2. Breech rhythm, an anticipated finding following the focal slowing.
3. Sharp waves in the region with the craniotomy, most of which are left temporal, a
few of which are left frontocentral.
