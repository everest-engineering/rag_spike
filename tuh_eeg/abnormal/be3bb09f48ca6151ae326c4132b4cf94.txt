CLINICAL HISTORY: 32 year old female with epilepsy since the age of 10, with tonic-clonic seizures. Last seizure was March 2009. This was an outpatient study for a 32-year-old female.

MEDICATIONS: Topamax

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a symmetric reactive 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing high amplitude bursts of rhythmic frontal delta. The delta and theta are paroxysmal but there is no definitive spike and wave activity noted with it. Drowsiness is characterized by an increase in background slowing. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response but no spike and wave activity.

HR: 72 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In this individual with epilepsy and these findings in hyperventilation, additional studies may be helpful to determine if there is underlying spike and wave activity.
