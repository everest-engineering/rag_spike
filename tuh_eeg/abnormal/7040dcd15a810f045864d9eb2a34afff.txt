CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old woman with epilepsy since age 15, seizure free for
several years. Characteristics of seizures
include shakiness.

MEDICATIONS: Zonegran and oral contraceptive.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
10.5 hertz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Hyperventilation is performed early on in the record producing head rocking artifact and
a small amount of beta which is symmetric. Prominent eye artifact such as lateral
rectus spike artifact is noted in the background. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 66 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. If
additional information is needed, comparison with previous EEG may be of use.
Alternatively, a study capturing sleep may also be valuable .
