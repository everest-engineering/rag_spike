CLINICAL HISTORY: 57 year old female who has encephalopathy with acute left PCA and MCA infarct. Tonoclonic seizure at 10 a.m. on September 1, 2010.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Cipro, Heparin
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates continuous, high amplitude left frontal delta which is periodic in nature. There is a bit of faster frequency activity picked at T1 and at 7 but there are also some left frontal or frontotemporal sharp waves associated with these activities. The high-amplitude delta can be reviewed at a slower paper speed and does not have frequency evolution. Its overall frequency is 2 Hz. As times there is a suggestion of an 8.3 Hz alpha rhythm in the right posterior quadrant but there is significant slowing in the right frontal region. At times the delta in the left posterior quadrant is slower than that in the anterior quadrant.
HR: 84bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1: Continuous delta from the left hemisphere.
2. Bilateral FIRDA.
3. Occasional left frontal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a severe disturbance in the left hemisphere affecting both gray and while matter. The sharp waves are congruent with the history of acute seizures. No seizures were recorded. Ongoing evaluation is suggested.
