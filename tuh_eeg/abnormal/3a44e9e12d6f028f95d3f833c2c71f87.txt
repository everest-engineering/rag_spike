CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old woman with intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient had twitching today. Please evaluate for seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Metoprolol, Keppra, Pantoprazole
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing opens, the patient is intubated and unresponsive. There is prominent frontal delta present bilaterally but which is more prominent and more sharply contoured in the left frontal region. Ativan is administered and by 4:04, the EEG starts to show an improvement with more of a beta and theta frequency pattern. There is low voltage frontal delta, but the activity is abating and it is not as periodic or as high amplitude.
HR: 140 bpm
IMPRESSION: Markedly abnormal EEG due to:
1. An initial pattern which is probably a late ictal pattern with rhythmic repetitive frontal delta bilaterally left-sided maximum.
2. Generalized background slowing at the end.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The initial pattern is probably a seizure, but the pattern did improve with benzodiazepines. No additional seizures were recorded.
