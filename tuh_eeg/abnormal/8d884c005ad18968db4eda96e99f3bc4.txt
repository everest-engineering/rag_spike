CLINICAL HISTORY:  49 year old right handed male with past medical history of seizures as a child, presents with last seizure in June, now with complaints of memory difficulties.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Phenobarbital.
REASON FOR EEG:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  Wakefulness and stage I sleep was recorded.  Activation procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The EEG opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm at 9 Hz with a 20-60 mV amplitude.  An increased amount of diffuse beta is seen in the recording.  Sleep is characterized by stage I. Activating procedures included hyperventilation which caused normal response and at times accentuated the focal slowing, which will be described below.  Photic stimulation did not evoke any abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  T4/F8 and independent T3/F7 focal slow waves seen frequently at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-40 mV.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Independent bilateral anterior temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of independent bilateral anterior temporal focal cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform seizures were seen.
