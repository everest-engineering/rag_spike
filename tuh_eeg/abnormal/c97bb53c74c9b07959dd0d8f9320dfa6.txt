LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 36-year-old man with a history of seizures since childhood, with no seizures in the last several years.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamotrigine, Topamax, Fosamax, vitamin D, calcium and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 9 Hz moderate amplitude alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and symmetrical vertex waves are observed.  Hyperventilation was performed and the results have no significant change in the background.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a normal cardiac rhythm.
FINDINGS:
No stages of sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 22 minutes EEG.  When compared to the EEG from 04/25/2008, epileptiform discharges seen over the right posterior temporal region are not captured on this study.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.
