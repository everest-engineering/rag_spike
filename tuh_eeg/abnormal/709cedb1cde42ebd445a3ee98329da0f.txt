REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  He is a 63-year-old man with history of epilepsy since age 29, has mainly tonic/clonic seizures refractory to Dilantin in relation to medication noncompliance.  Currently he is having 1-2 seizures per month.  He has a history of alcohol abuse and cocaine abuse in the past.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with the addition of anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  There is intermittent frontal electrode and multielectrode dislodgement throughout the recording, as well as muscle artifact.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta seen.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation produces no abnormal  discharges.   The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves are seen intermittently in bilateral frontal regions, at a frequency of 2-4 Hz and amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to bifrontal bilateral frontal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the bilateral frontal regions, which is consistent with his known trauma.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
