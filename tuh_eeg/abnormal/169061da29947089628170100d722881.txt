CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed male with complex partial epilepsy status post
severe closed head injury in the 1980s. Seizures described as an aura followed by stuttering
with episodes of loss of time over seconds. The patient reports head trauma in 1971 with
seizures in 1980.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Phenobarbital.
Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20 system of
electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are
performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD In maximal wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat
disorganized and slow with an alpha rhythm of 7.5 Hz. Hyperventilation is performed early on in
the record, producing an increase in slowing with rhythmic frontal theta and delta and some
shifting slowing. Paroxysmal rhythmic slowing is noted, which is a bit more prominent on the
light. Photic stimulation at 11 Hz is associated with frontal spike and wave activity. Other
frequency stimulation produced bursts of frontal delta without the definitive pair of spike and
wave complexes.
HR: 50bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Background slowing.
2. Paroxysmal bursts of rhythmic slowing.
3. Shifting slowing.
4. A pair of frontal spike and slow wave complexes.
CLINICAL The background slowing described above was identified in
previous studies. The frontal spike and slow wave complexes may be part of a frontal lobe
epilepsy or may reflect more than one mechanism for seizures.
