CLINICAL HISTORY:  21 year old male with history of male with history of HIV on HART, transferred from an outside hospital with seizures, now suspected to have meningitis on isolation.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Fentanyl, Propofol, Truvada, Lexiva, Apresoline, Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir, Vancomycin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion and a seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while unresponsive.  No activating procedures were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some electrode impedance artifact seen in the right hemisphere.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontal central beta.  The patient does not appear to have any normal stages of sleep.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen over the left hemisphere, but maximal at T3, almost continuously throughout the recording at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-70 mV.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz with an amplitude of 20-40 mV seen continuously throughout the record.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Left hemisphere focal slowing maximal in the mid temporal region.
Generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal structural dysfunction in the left hemisphere, maximal in the left mid temporal region which has a high correlation with a lesion in that region.  In addition, there is evidence of generalized cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
