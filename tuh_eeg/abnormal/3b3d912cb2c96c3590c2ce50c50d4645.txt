CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right handed woman with a 7-year history of epilepsy.  Five tonic-clonic seizures then seizure free for 3 years.  Now she has episodes where she has pins and needles and her head feels like something is making her head turn.
MEDICATIONS:  Zonegran, Keppra, birth-control pills and prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is appropriately organized for age with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm of 30-40 microvolts and a generous amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  Hyperventilation produces bilateral theta.  Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic temporal theta and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.  Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Photic stimulation elicits scant bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  However, stage 2 sleep was not achieved.
