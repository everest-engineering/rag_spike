CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old right handed female with medical history of subdural
hematoma x2 with surgery on the left and a CVA. She had an episode of one
generalized tonic clonic seizure in 2007. The patient denies any more seizures. Past
medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, CHF. She has a skull defect on
the left.
MEDICATIONS: Lantus, Lovastatin, Atenolol, Quinapril, Procardia,
Hydrochlorothiazide.
INTRODUCTION: A 1 hour sleep deprived digital video EEG was performed in lab using
standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic
stimulation was performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: There is an 8.8. Hz alpha rhythm with increased
amplitude on the left. In the background there is occasional bursts of slowing on the left
or right The patient transitions in and out of sleep vertex waves and spindles were
seen in sleep. Photic stimulation elicits driving. There are no sharp waves on the right.
HR: 78 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This EEG is abnormal due to:
1. Rare bursts of shifting slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The amplitude asymmetry is expected with increased
attenuation on the left which Is consistent with skull defect and does not make the EEG
abnormal. No sharp waves were seen
