CLINICAL HISTORY:  83 year old right handed woman with a dizzy spell, worse since January of this year.  Symptoms increase with head turning.
MEDICATIONS:  Diltiazem, Lisinopril, Omeprazole, Isosorbide, ASA, Levothyroxine
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was not performed, but photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz 30 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.  The patient is tense.  Scant drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation does elicit a subtle driving response.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
