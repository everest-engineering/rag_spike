LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  24 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a chief complaint of slurred speech and stuttering for 1 day.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide, carvedilol, aspirin and Celexa.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single electrocardiogram lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and vertex waves are observed.  Hyperventilation results in mild symmetrical background slowing. Stepped photic stimulation results in no change in the background.  A single electrocardiogram lead demonstrates a regular rate.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 24 minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persist, a repeat study with sleep may be of benefit.
