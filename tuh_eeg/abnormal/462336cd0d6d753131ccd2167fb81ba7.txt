CLINICAL HISTORY:  56 year old right handed female with epilepsy, asthma, hepatitis C, chronic abdominal pain.
MEDICATIONS: Endocet, Ambien, Luminal, Nasonex, Prilosec, Proventil, Advair, Fosamax
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.7-Hz alpha rhythm and a generous amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta.  There is occasional shifting slowing as the patient drifts off to sleep.  Hyperventilation produces a small amount of slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits a vigorous driving response with harmonic and super harmonic driving at 3 Hz.
HR:    84 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  In contrast to previous EEGs, there was no significant slowing in wakefulness.  This patient has also had normal EEGs in the past.  The evanescent shifting slowing may be part of this patient's interictal pattern.  Alternatively, it may be impacted by her hepatic dysfunction.
