CLINICAL HISTORY: 61 year old woman with hyperlipidemia and vertigo, evaluated
for syncope.
MEDICATIONS: Amiodipine, ASA, Colchicine, lisinopril, Meclizine, Metoprolol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is
well organized with a 9.8 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage,
frontocentral beta activity. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background
theta with rate bursts of right or left temporal theta. Deeper stages of sleep are not
achieved. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed in this record. A
subject of this age is permitted a small amount of temporal theta in drowsiness.
