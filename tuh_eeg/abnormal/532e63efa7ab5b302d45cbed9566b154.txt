HISTORY: 74 year old female with new onset generalized tonoclonic seizure less than 45 seconds.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Vancomycin, Valium.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. There was no photic or hyperventilation simulation used.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: This is a diffusely slow EEG with an 8 Hz predominant rhythm. There are transient sharps originating from the right occipital region. It does occasionally involve the left occipital region. There is a posterior 3 to 6 Hz dominant focal slowing and sharp waves, sometimes seen With the sharp wave and sometimes independently.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Diffuse disturbance of cerebral function.
2. Exhibital sharp waves are supportive of a localized mechanism for seizures.
CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localized mechanism for epilepsy.
