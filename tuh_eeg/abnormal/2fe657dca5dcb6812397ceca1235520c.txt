CLINICAL HISTORY: 28 year old woman admitted 2 days ago status post severe
head trauma with cerebral edema.

MEDICATIONS: Vasopressin, Epinephrine, Dopamine, Phenylephrine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
comatose.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The patient is examined during the EEG. The EEG
is an electronic format. Sections of the record are performed with the ECS montage.
There is no definitive cerebral activity. There is EKG and other artifacts, including some
rhythmic artifacts picked up at 02. Stimulation of the patient does not activate the
record. There is no variability. The electrode integrity is tested by the technologist.

HR: 120 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Electrocerebral inactivity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: In the appropriate clinical context, in the absence of
profound hypothermia or medications which might explain this pattern, this EEG is
compatible with electrocerebral silence.
