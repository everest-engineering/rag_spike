CLINICAL HISTORY: 15 year old female with global headaches since childhood and epistaxis.
MEDICATIONS: None
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity with mixed theta, followed by vertex waves, and spindles in stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving. Hyperventilation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features are observed. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy nor headache.
