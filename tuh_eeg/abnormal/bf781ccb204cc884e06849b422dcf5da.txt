REASON FOR STUDY:  Somnolence.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 56-year-old woman with 8 episodes of urinary incontinence, somnolence without loss of consciousness with shaking. Past medical history hypertension, CAD, also obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, anxiety, stroke, diabetes and syncope.  Had a recent CABG, has acute kidney injury, hypertension and AFib.
MEDICATIONS:  Heparin, insulin, metoprolol, famotidine, digoxin, warfarin, aspirin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded mainly in sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record is mainly in sleep, but during wakefulness there appears to be  at best a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  The patient's background is mainly at times while in wakefulness appears to be slow in the theta frequency and she appears to become drowsy quickly.  Activating procedures were not performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild generalized slowing with excessive theta in wakefulness.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal electroencephalogram due to mild excessive theta in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
