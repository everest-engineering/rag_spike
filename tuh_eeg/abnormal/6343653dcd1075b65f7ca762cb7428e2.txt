CLINICAL HISTORY:  22 year old woman with Downs syndrome, up to 22 seizures per month with brief staring and/or incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Lamictal and Vimpat.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  Some sections of the record are somewhat disorganized with an 8.7 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is excess beta.  There is some sharply contoured slowing picked up in the left anterior temporal region.  Spiky, eye artifacts are also noted.  There is shifting slowing also observed.  MU rhythm is noted.  The primary foci for epileptiform activity is in the right or left temporal region, but it can range from anterior to posterior temporal.  Brief drowsiness is characterized by an increase in beta, and that occurs during photic stimulation.  There is a scant driving response.  Much of the epileptiform activity is a bit more on the left than the right.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Background slowing and disorganization.
Sharp waves, primarily seen in the left temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is one of many EEGs for this patient.  Other EEGs have demonstrated epileptiform activity in the left temporal or parietal region.  Only her initial EEG showed generalized spike and wave activity, and this has not been seen in
the more recent studies.  Overall, in comparison to the very first study, there is significantly less in the way of epileptiform activity.
