CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with metabolic encephalopathy, seizures.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Keppra, Prednisone, Oxycontin, Lasix
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is poorly responsive.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a mixed frequency pattern with intermittent bursts of beta but prominent delta and theta. There are shifting asymmetries noted. There are also shifting beta asymmetries but a suggestion of intermittent, sharply contoured slowing identified independently in the right or left frontocentral region. There is a bit more focality in the right hemisphere than the left. Stimulation of the patient produces muscle.
HR: 96 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Marked background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: In comparison to a previous study last week, technically, this is a better quality study. While the pattern remains abnormal, from a perspective of pathology, both patterns are different but similar in terms of prognosis in that both suggest a relatively significant disturbance of cerebral function. The shifting asymmetries described above may be correlated with imaging.
