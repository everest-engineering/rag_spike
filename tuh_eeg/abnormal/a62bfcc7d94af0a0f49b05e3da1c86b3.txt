CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 47-year-old male with epilepsy and seizure related subdural hematoma in 2010, last seizure 2 months ago.  The patient amnestic for the seizure.  Now with right leg and hip weakness requiring a cane.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm, but there is a small amount of 7 Hz theta activity identified in the background.  Hyperventilation is performed early in the record increasing the amplitude of the background and producing a small amount of theta.  Features of drowsiness include attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and increase in theta and slow rolling eye movements.  Deeper stages of sleep are not achieved.
Photic stimulation was remarkable for photo electric artifact.
Heart rate 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This a mildly abnormal EEG due to:
Mild excess theta noted in wakefulness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this EEG or in the previous EEG.  If epilepsy is an important consideration a follow-up test which may be a sleep-deprived EEG or a more prolonged sleep EEG may be helpful in capturing epileptiform activity.
