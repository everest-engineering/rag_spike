CLINICAL HISTORY: 34 year old right handed man with a history of sleep apnea with a possible seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide, Metoprolol, Tartrate
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 7 to 8 Hz, which does not appear to be reactive to eye opening.  There is a lack of normal frontocentral beta.  No normal sleep architecture is seen, however.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts are seen throughout the recording.
Intermittent bursts of frontal intermittent rhythmic delta are seen (FIRDA).
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
FIRDA.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
