CLINICAL HISTORY: 47 year old right handed male with cocaine related dementia, severe hypertension, heart failure. The patient had a seizure followed by visual impairment and is poorly cooperative. Acute right occipital infarct.

MEDICATIONS: Lasix, Carbamazepine, Furosemide, Hydralazine

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is not particularly cooperative. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 6.8 Hz alpha rhythm. The overall background is disorganized with theta frequency activity, bursts of frontally predominant delta activity and some shifting arrhythmic delta activity including some identified in the right posterior quadrant. Independent, right or left anterior temporal sharp waves are observed. Some of these are bilateral, frontotemporal and a few are right central parietal. Stimulation of the patient produces no alerting response. When unstimulated, the patient drifts off to sleep with significantly more delta.

HR: 84 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Independent right or left temporal sharp waves.
3. New sharp waves which are in the right central parietal region.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The background slowing has been previously described. The independent left or right temporal sharp waves have also been noted before. The right central parietal are new findings. This EEG supports a localization-related mechanism for epilepsy. In that there is an occipital lobe Infarct, the focal features are less prominent than one might anticipate.
