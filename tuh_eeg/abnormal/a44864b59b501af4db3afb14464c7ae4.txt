CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 61-year-old woman with epilepsy, seizure free for the past 3 years.  Previous craniotomy with residual left sided deficit and cranial defect C4 to P4, as well as T6.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred.  Photic stimulation was completed.  This was an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  There is a fair amount of muscle artifact noted in the background and there is a slight degree of disorganization in both hemispheres.  The most prominent features in this record include intermittent focal slowing in the right hemisphere with spread to the midline with bursts of higher amplitude, right frontocentral delta.  In the context of a breech rhythm, there is some sharply contoured discharges at F4, but without after going slow wave.
Photic stimulation elicited a driving response somewhat more apparent on the left than the right, but present bilaterally.
Features of sleep included the appearance of frontal delta, right more so than the left.  Brief stage I sleep with vertex waves was noted, but stage II sleep was not sustained.  Heart rate 66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Intermittent, focal slowing noted in the right hemisphere most prominent in drowsiness or sleep with a generous field of spread into the right hemisphere and to the midline.
Disruption of faster frequency activity in the right frontocentral region.
Mild slowing and disorganization on the left.
Clinical correlation, no definitive epileptiform features were identified.
