CLINICAL HISTORY:  68 year old female with history of seizures, apnea, GERD, and frequent episodes of feeling anxious.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol, Topamax, Alendronate, Lovastatin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were performed, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well defined posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta. Activating procedures, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation, reveal no abnormal discharges.  Normal sleep, stage I and stage II, were seen.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T3 with a frequency of 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-70 mV.  These discharges were seen occasionally.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Occasional left mid temporal slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid temporal region, which is nonspecific in regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
