CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed woman with epilepsy onset in 2007, but seizure free for the last 2 years.

MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 11 Hz, 40 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm. Drowsiness Is characterized by an increase in background slowing with an increase in beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of this relatively low voltage background. Photic stimulation elicits subtle bilateral driving.

HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No focal nor epileptiform features were identified. There are no previous EEG for comparison. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
