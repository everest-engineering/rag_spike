CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed woman with a stroke in 2009, rightsided weakness, myoclonic seizures. Last seizure was yesterday.

MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 9 to 10 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a generous amount of background beta. In relaxed wakefulness there is a bit more theta than anticipated. Drowsiness is characterized by rhythmic central theta. Stage 2 sleep includes vertex waves and spindles followed by arousals. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Very mildly abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild background disorganization with an alpha rhythm that is a bit more variable than traditionally accepted.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. No myoclonus occurred, and there were no significant focal features. In this individual with a stroke and myoclonus, an ambulatory study capturing her symptoms might be useful.
