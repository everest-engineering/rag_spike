CLINICAL HISTORY:  29 year old woman with fibromyalgia and multiple seizures per week which include an aura of a funny smell, then shaking and clenching of the teeth.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Klonopin, Pristiq, Pamelor
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  The patient is extremely sleepy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG includes generous stage 2 sleep.  With arousal, there is a well-defined alpha rhythm.   Hyperventilation serves to activate the patient to a more awake state.
HR:    96 bpm
IMPRESSION:   Normal EEG
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were noted.  Because of this patient's refractory seizures, additional EEG recording will be undertaken to more completely characterize her spells.
