REASON FOR STUDY:  Preop for aortic arch replacement.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 29-year-old man with a past medical history of aortic valve replacement in 2012 with complications and with IV drug use, diabetes, depression, anxiety, hepatitis C, with complaints of leg and back pain, found to have an aortic and bilateral iliac thrombus and he is preop for aortic arch replacement.
MEDICATIONS:  Pepcid, morphine, Lopressor, paroxetine, methadone, heparin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while awake and drowsy and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 5 Hz which appears somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some faster frequencies in frontocentral beta seen intermittently and some stage 1 sleep architecture appears to be seen.  Overall, there is a diffusely slow background in the delta range seen almost continuously throughout the recording.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen over the right hemisphere, maximum at T4, at times at F8 seen frequently throughout the recording.
Generalized slow wave at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts is seen almost continuously throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to right midtemporal focal slowing as well as generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right midtemporal region, with an additional diffuse cerebral dysfunction, both of which are nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  The primary team was informed of these abnormal findings in the EEG.
