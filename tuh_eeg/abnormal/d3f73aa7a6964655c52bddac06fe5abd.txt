CLINICAL HISTORY: 36 year old right handed male with childhood epilepsy, currently experiencing seizures described by a funny feeling in his body lasting minutes. He also reports tonic clonic seizures, profound psychiatric impairment.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a 1-hour EEG. Photic stimulation and hyperventilation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the overall background EEG is reasonably well organized with a 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of shifting slowing. Notable in this record are just prior, during, and after hyperventilation are bursts of high amplitude frontally predominant 3-5 Hz spike and slow wave complexes. These are high amplitude, frontally predominant, symmetric, and typically occur in bursts lasting 2 seconds, but up to 3 seconds. They are symmetric, bifrontal, with a polyspike component. Features of drowsiness include vertex waves. K-complexes are noted in stage 2 sleep. Dyshormia is noted as the patient transitions into sleep. In the transition to and from sleep there is some isolated high amplitude or more subtle spike and wave complexes also observed.
Photic stimulation is remarkable for a driving response. In addition, just following 11 Hz spike and wave activity and in the intermediate/frequencies, such as 17 Hz, spike and wave activity is observed.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG is significantly different from the initial EEG November 4, 2009 which did not identify generalized spike and wave activity. In that study, hyperventilation was not performed. This EEG is much more supportive of a generalized and focal mechanism for epilepsy. It is also different in that there is no generalized background slowing noted today.
