CLINICAL HISTORY:  57 year old right handed woman  with episodes of lightheadedness, headache and an episode of loss of consciousness for 10 minutes and postictal confusion without incontinence. Also, episodes of tongue biting, episodes of nausea.  Aortic regurgitation, possible seizures and possible past stroke.
MEDICATIONS:  No seizures medications.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  This is an awake and briefly drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9.5 hertz alpha rhythm. Drowsiness is characterized by attenuation of alpha rhythm with POSTS. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified. A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If seizures are an important consideration, a followup EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
