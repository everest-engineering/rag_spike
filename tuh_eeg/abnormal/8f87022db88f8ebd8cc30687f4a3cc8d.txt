CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is an 18-year-old woman who is pregnant and is due on 11/13.  She has a past medical history of seizures and is currently not on any medications.  Stopped taking antiseizure medications last August when she had her last seizure.  Patient had last seizure 2 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is 10-11 Hz alpha rhythms.  There is a generous beta activity.  Peak alpha rhythm is slightly higher in amplitude on the left than the right and there is also posterior slow waves of youth seen on this EEG.  The drowsiness is characterized by a slow roving eye movements with spindles in asleep.  Hyperventilation caused increase in amplitude and photic stimulation did not cause any driving.  Heart rate was 84.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in awake and asleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal EEG and there are no epileptiform discharges or seizure activity.  Comparison with previous childhood EEGs may be helpful to characterize epileptiform activity.
