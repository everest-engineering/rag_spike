CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed female with a history of tonic-clonic
seizures with postictal confusion lasting 1 to 2 minutes. Seizures are preceded by an
iron taste in her mouth. Past history of trauma, November 2009
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Lamictal.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a low-voltage 10.5 Hz
alpha rhythm with a small amount of low-voltage fronto-central beta activity. The
technologist struggles with this patient because of prominent sweat artifact on this
unusually warm day. Hyperventilation produces an Increase in amplitude. Drowsiness
is characterized by an increase in beta. Photic stimulation elicits a low-voltage driving
response.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed in this record. A
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. If additional information is
necessary, a repeat study with more extensive sleep is suggested.
