CLINICAL HISTORY: 48 year old left handed female with a history of childhood epilepsy with complex partial and generalized seizures typically 2 to 3 seizures a month but last seizures was on the 14th with multiple seizures, previously treated with Dilantin and Topamax.
MEDICATIONS: Tegretol
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In maximum wakefulness, the background EEG is somewhat slow with excess theta and a poorly defined 9Hz alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation is performed early-on in the record, clearly accentuating rhythmic mixed theta delta from the right temporal region as well as left temporal sharp waves. Following hyperventilation, the sharp waves and the rhythmic slowing gradually abate and the patient becomes somewhat drowsy. Photic stimulation does not significantly activate the record.
HR: 72 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Rhythmic theta and delta primarily from the right temporal region.
3. Right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: These findings were seen in previous EEGs. Of note, only 2 of this patient's previous 11 EEGs were available for review today but the findings are similar in this individual with known, refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and previous, unilateral or bitemporal findings.
