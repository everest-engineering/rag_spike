CLINICAL HISTORY: 66 year old woman with complex partial seizures with loss of consciousness, past history of hypertension.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, Dilantin, Phenytoin, HCTZ
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: Much of the record includes relaxed wakefulness or drowsiness. In this drowsy state there is more of a theta and beta frequency pattern. In addition, there are bursts of sharply contoured focal slowing in the left anterior temporal region. Some of the bursts occur with pairs or brief bursts of sharply contoured theta frequency activity. Photic stimulation produces scant driving, as well as some electrode artifact. The left anterior temporal, irregular, sharply contoured slowing is identified at that time as well. There appears to be a T1/T3 sharp wave mixed with this. As the patient becomes a bit more drowsy, there is also some rhythmic theta in the left frontal region. The normal testing to search for an alpha rhythm was not performed. Spontaneous eye opening and eye closure was identified, but there appeared to be scant, lower voltage, 10.5 Hz alpha activity, better defined on the right compared to the left.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Irregular bursts of left mid to anterior temporal sharply contoured theta.
2. Subtle and mixed left mid to anterior temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a localization related mechanism for epilepsy. The primary features were in the temporal region, spreading to the frontal region as the patient became drowsy. The overall awake background was likely, Inadequately assessed for an adult of this age due to communication difficulties.
