REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 59-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, multiple lacunar infarcts, chronic small-vessel disease, noncompliant on medications, comes with a chief complaint of status epilepticus.
TECHNICAL:  Difficulties none.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that at best reaches 6 Hz which appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta during wakefulness.  Activating procedures were not performed.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and sleep and easily goes into sleep.  During the recording, specifically as the patient goes to sleep, there appears to be small sharply contoured discharges seen at T3 and at T4 most consistent with benign epileptiform transient of sleep.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Mild generalized slowing at 5-7 Hz seen continuously during withdrawal wakefulness throughout the recording.
SEIZURES:
None.
HEART RATE:  102.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to mild generalized slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Again please note that benign epileptiform  sharp transients (BETS) were seen in this recording.
