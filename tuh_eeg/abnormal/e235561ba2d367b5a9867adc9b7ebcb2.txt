ORIGINAL
CLINICAL HISTORY: 41 year old right handed woman with recurrent syncope.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized. There is a 12 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 60 microvolts with a generous
amount of low-voltage frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in
theta. Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness is noted with paroxysmal bursts of
theta. There is also some hypnagogic hypersynchrony observed. Hyperventilation
produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits
vigorous bilateral driving.
HR: 66 bpm with occasional APCs.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were 2 normal variants, hypnagogic
hypersynchrony and rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness. If epilepsy is an
important consideration, a followup study may be considered.
