CLINICAL HISTORY: 77 year old right handed female presents with a history of diabetes, cardiac dysrhythmia, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, hypertension, Alzheimer's, senile dementia, osteoporosis.  She presents with bilateral tremors and a history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Alendronate, Aricept, Aspirin, Lantus, Lisinopril, Prilosec, Senna, Trihexyphenidyl.
REASON FOR STUDY:  History of seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation was performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that, at best, reaches 8.5 Hz, which appears to be reactive to eye opening.  There is no abnormal frontocentral beta.  The EEG is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Photic stimulation produces no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  Focal slow waves seen at T3 at a frequency of 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolts.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
infrequent left mid-temporal delta.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the left mid-temporal region, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
