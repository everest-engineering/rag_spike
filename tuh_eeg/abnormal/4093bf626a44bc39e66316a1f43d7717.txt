CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 20-year-old woman with a history of seizures versus non-epileptic seizures since age 14, is currently 5 months pregnant and is a prisoner.
MEDICATIONS:  Benadryl.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using a standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with and additional anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures include hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9-10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontal central beta.  The patient is recorded during wakefulness and stage 1 sleep.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation and hyperventilation which produced no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
HEART RATE:  66, however, there appears to be an AV block, although this is only a single electrode EKG.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is a normal awake and asleep EEG.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.  Please note that a normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  Please also note the patient had an abnormal EKG strip which appears to have an AV block, however, a full 12-lead electrocardiogram should be performed and follow up with primary doctor for this abnormality is recommended.
