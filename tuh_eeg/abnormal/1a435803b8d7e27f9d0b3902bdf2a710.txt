CLINICAL HISTORY: 69 year old right handed woman with syncope behind the wheel with subsequent motor vehicle accident. Afterwards she was quickly oriented, but did not remember the accident. History of hypertension, depression, hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS: Cardizem, Zocor, Lexapro, Lexapro, Lisinopril, Ambien, Paxil

INTRODUCTION; Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Photic stimulation was completed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a well formed 9.3 Hz, 60 microvolts posterior dominant rhythm and a slow amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. In addition, there is some rhythmic temporal theta noted in the transition to sleep. Vertex waves are identified in stage 1 sleep with spindles. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving. The patient is drifting off to sleep during photic stimulation. There is a single artifactual appearing sharp wave noted at FP2, F4 on 1 occasional followed by more well defined artifacts in the frontal region. These are seen only briefly and in the last quarter of the record.

HR: 55 bpm

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and epileptiform activity can be elusive. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a more prolonged 1 hour study or an outpatient ambulatory study may be helpful to assess underlying seizure disorder.
