CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 69-year-old male with TBSA burns to bilateral lower extremities, status post escharotomy.  He has a past history of epilepsy or seizure disorder.
MEDICATIONS:  Phenobarbital, phenytoin, Percocet, heparin, and others.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1-channel of EKG.  Despite the challenges of the ICU, impedances were okay.  The technologist did need to readjust some of the electrodes.  The patient was described as awake.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG demonstrates a dynamic pattern.  At times there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm.  At other times, there are bursts of more rhythmic slowing identified bilaterally.  The bursts of rhythmic delta are a bit more prominent on the right than the left.  They are also a bit more prominent in the right posterior quadrant.
Heart rate:  130 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to disruption of normal background with bursts of rhythmic delta right greater than left.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No seizures, sharp waves, or spikes were noted.  The bursts of rhythmic slowing are a bit more prominent on the right than the left.  These findings may be correlated with this patient's history and imaging.  To more completely characterize this patient's epilepsy, a repeat study when the patient is out of the ICU is suggested.
