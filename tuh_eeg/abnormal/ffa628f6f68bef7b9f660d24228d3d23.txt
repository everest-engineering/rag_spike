CLINICAL HISTORY: 68 year old gentleman with 2 seizures, the first 9 years ago and
the second 1 year ago.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed In lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. Neither hyperventilation nor photic stimulation activate the
record.The patient remains quite drowsy.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz posterior
dominant rhythm but the patient transitions relatively quickly back into a drowsy state.
Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the alpha rhythm with more of a theta
frequency pattern followed by vertex waves.
HR: 55 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Clinical correction
to determine why the patient is so sleepy may be considered.
