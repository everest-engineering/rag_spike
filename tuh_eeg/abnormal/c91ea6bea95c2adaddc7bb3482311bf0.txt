LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of a head injury in 2011, now with right-sided pain, migraines and panic attacks with associated shaking.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Klonopin.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORDING:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  A fast alpha variant is frequently observed.  Diffuse excess beta activity is captured.  During sleep symmetrical sleep spindles and vertex waves are noted.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no significant change in the background .  Stepped photic stimulation does not result in a change in the background .
FINDINGS:
Excess beta.
Stage 2 sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep 21 minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  The excess beta could be secondary to a medication effect such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates.
