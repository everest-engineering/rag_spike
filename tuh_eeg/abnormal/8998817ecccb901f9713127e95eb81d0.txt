CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 49-year-old male with history of frontal sinusitis, hypertension, left sided weakness, and new onset seizures 01/07/2013, now with neck pain, dizziness, and balance problems.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In apparent wakefulness, the overall background EEG is somewhat slow with rhythmic theta and delta.  It is difficult to define this alpha rhythm in an otherwise low voltage EEG.  Generous frontal central beta activity was noted.
Hyperventilation produced prominent rhythmic bilateral 3-4 Hz activity.
Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.  In addition, the bursts of slowing were a bit more prominent on the left, some of which were sharply contoured, but without definitive sharp waves.
Heart rate:  66 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized background slowing noted intermittently in wakefulness.
Scant alpha rhythm (this is not considered necessarily pathological).
Background disorganization.
Superimposed focal slowing more so from the left frontal temporal region.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  In comparison to a previous EEG, 01/07/2013, the focal slowing does not appear to be so prominent, but there may be more generalized background slowing.  The previous EEG was primarily in sleep. Consideration for both a focal and a diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction is appropriate.
