CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 68-year-old with generalized weakness, COPD, and tonic clonic seizure.
MEDICATIONS:  Tylenol, metoprolol, Klonopin, and oxycodone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation are performed.  Hyperventilation was deferred in this patient with cardiopulmonary disease.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm reaching 50 microvolts with 10 Hz low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Frequent muscle artifact was noted.  Very brief drowsiness was characterized by a decrease in muscle artifact, attenuation of the alpha rhythm, and an increase in theta.  Rare lambda was noted in wakefulness with rare POSTS noted in sleep.  Photic stimulation elicited bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  The general theta described above may be related to this patient's benzodiazepine use.  If additional information is needed, a follow-up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
