CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 48-year-old left-handed woman admitted February 2013 with new onset seizures and a cystic brain mass status post day #1 after resection of right parietal tumor.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Morphine, Zofran, and Percocet.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at the bedside in the ICU using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  The patient was noted to have a prominent right craniotomy.
TECHNICAL:  There is some muscle artifact, but overall this is a technically satisfactory record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  As the tracing begins, the EEG is remarkable for a mixture of arrhythmic mixed theta-delta from the right hemisphere.  The left hemisphere has more of a medium amplitude more rhythmic theta pattern.  Although the patient is awake and following commands, an alpha rhythm was not identified.  As the patient drifts off to sleep, more of a rhythmic theta pattern is noted on the left with a mixture of arrhythmic delta and theta on the right.  Asymmetric spindles were noted out of the right central region.  In the context of a breech rhythm, there is some very subtle right frontocentral sharp waves noted.
The patient transitions in and out of stage II sleep with spindle activity.
Heart rate 50 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:
Continuous focal slowing on the right.
Background slowing on the left.
Rare discrete right frontal sharp waves.
FIRDA noted at the close of the record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG supports a structural process on the right.  There are some subtle sharp waves noted in the region of the craniotomy on the right.  The bilateral background slowing suggests a bihemispheric process and may be part of this patient's postoperative pattern.  Correlation with imaging and clinical history is suggested.
