CLINICAL HISTORY: A 28-year-old male with frequent falling, recurrent episodes of lightheadedness with loss of consciousness. Past history of gastric bypass and Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10Â·20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is a primarily awake record with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
DESCRIPTION Of RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta. Hyperventilation did not significantly activate the record. Photic stimulation elicited brief bilateral driving.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and brief drowsiness.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
