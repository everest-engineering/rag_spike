CLINICAL HISTORY:  26 year old right handed female with a history of tuberous sclerosis, Lupus nephritis, and brain lesions respected at age 7, with expressive aphasia at baseline.  Follow-up EEG for a history of seizures.
MEDICATIONS:  Keppra, Versed, Ativan, Heparin, Compazine, Vimpat.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Change in mental status.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video  EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and EKG electrodes.  No activating procedures were performed.  The patient was lethargic and unresponsive during the EEG.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow EEG with no posterior dominant rhythm and no clear frontocentral beta.  Some eye movements can be seen.  No normal sleep architecture is seen.  No activating procedures were performed.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges are seen at T6-O2, at times P4, mainly in the posterior quadrant at 1 to 2 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 100 microvolts.
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz
SEIZURES:  Although the PLEDs were continuous, they do not appear to evolve and do not appear to have a clinical correlate from the testing performed by the tech and the video.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Rhythmic right posterior quadrant PLEDs.
Generalized slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG is consistent with the diagnosis of localization epilepsy with seizures possibly arising from the right posterior quadrant.  There is also
evidence of continuous focal cerebral dysfunction in this region which may be related to a focal lesion like a tumor in that region. Lastly, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is non-specified with regards to etiology. No clear seizures were seen.
