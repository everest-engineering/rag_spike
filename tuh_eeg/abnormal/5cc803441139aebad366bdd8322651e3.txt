CLINICAL HISTORY:  63 year old right handed woman with episodic memory loss, depression.
MEDICATIONS:  Simvastatin, Fosamax.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation was performed.  This is an awake and sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness there is a 9.5 Hz 30 mV posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity.
Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements and attenuation of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    66 bpm
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A low voltage record is a normal finding.  No epileptiform features were noted.
