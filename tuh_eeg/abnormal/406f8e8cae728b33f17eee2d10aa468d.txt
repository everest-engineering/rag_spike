CLINICAL HISTORY: 70 year old woman with epilepsy since 1984. Black-out spells. Auditory hallucinations.
MEDICATIONS: Topamax, Keppra.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. This is her fifth EEG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is an increased 5-Hz posterior dominant rhythm. There is a small amount of excess temporal theta. In hyperventilation, there is subtle focal delta in the temporal regions, right more so than the left. The activity in the temporal regions is sharply contoured bilaterally. Vertex waves and spindles are identified in stage 2 sleep. Subtle right temporal sharp waves are noted in relaxed wakefulness.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Mild excess temporal theta for age.
2. Subtle right temporal sharp waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: The epileptiform activity identified today is much less prominent than that seenâ•– in the 4 previous EEGs. The background otherwise is not significantly changed.
