CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed male who fell off the lower bunk bed and then was confused with a blood sugar of 73.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Ativan, Tylenol, Percocet.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE' RECORD: As the tracing begins, the patient is awake and conversant, but the background EEG is somewhat slow. There is primarily only a theta frequency pattern with a glimpse of an alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an increase in theta. When present, the alpha rhythm is in the 8-9 Hz range. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing with brief stage II sleep which is not sustained. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient seems to be drowsy. The patient is drifting into stage I sleep during photic stimulation.
HR: 72bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted in the record.
Additional evaluation for this patient's hypersomnolence and background slowing may be appropriate.
