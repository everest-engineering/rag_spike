CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 38-year-old female with history of seizures.  She is a poor historian with limited English complaining of epilepsy, does not know if she had febrile seizures or any other type of seizures when she was a child.  The patient started to have seizures after delivered her baby.  Last seizure was 5 years ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbamazepine, valproic acid, vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital EEG was performed in the lab using the standard international 10/20 system of electrode placement in addition to T1 and T2 electrodes and 1-channel of EKG monitoring.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.  This tracing captures wakefulness only.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, the alpha rhythm is 9-10 Hz in frequency, 20-40 microvolts in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontal central beta activity which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70-80 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities or seizures were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy/  if seizures are clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
