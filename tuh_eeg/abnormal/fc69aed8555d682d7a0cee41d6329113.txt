CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 58-year-old male with episodes of memory loss and forgetfulness. One week prior to this EEG the patient had a 2 day episode of inability to talk, eat, or respond to wife.  Past history of heroine addiction, 2 years clean on methadone.
MEDICATIONS:  Methadone.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake through stage 2 sleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness the background EEG is appropriately organized with a 10 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontal central beta.  Occasional muscle twitch artifact was noted with eye movements.
Features of drowsiness include rhythmic slowing, followed by vertex waves, K-complexes, spindles, and POSTS.
Photic stimulation was performed while the patient was in stage 2 sleep and did not activate the record.
Hyperventilation did not activate the record.
Heart rate:  72 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No focal or epileptiform features were identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are an important consideration, a follow up tracing capturing one of his spells may be of value.
