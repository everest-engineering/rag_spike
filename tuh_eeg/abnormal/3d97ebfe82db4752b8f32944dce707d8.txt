CLINICAL HISTORY:  53 year old right handed male status post seizures and fall.  Seizures started 2 months ago after running out of Xanax.
MEDICATIONS:  Topamax, Keppra, Lovenox, Oxycontin, Citalopram.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizures.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.  Activating procedures were not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with a posterior dominant rhythm that best reaches 8 Hz but appears to be somewhat reactive to eye opening.  There is some frontocentral beta.  No activating procedures were performed. The patient is recorded in wakefulness and drowsiness.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Focal slow waves seen at T4/C4 continuously throughout the recording at 2 to 4 Hz with an amplitude of 20 to 60 microvolt and an associated breach in that region.
Generalized slow waves at 5 to 7 Hz seen continuously throughout the recording during wakefulness.
SEIZURES:   None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Focal slow waves seen at T4/C4.
Generalized slow waves at 5-7 Hz.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right centrotemporal region which is consistent with the known craniotomy.  In addition, there is evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
