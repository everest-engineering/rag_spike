CLINICAL HISTORY: 19 year old right handed female with childhood epilepsy, seizures with loss of consciousness and incontinence of urine.  Last seizure 2 weeks ago.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The background EEG is well organized with an 11 Hz alpha rhythm.  Early in drowsiness and in hyperventilation, there is prominent background theta.  Hyperventilation also produces a rhythmic, higher amplitude, relatively symmetric slowing.  Posterior slow waves of youth are noted in the background. Deeper stages of sleep were not sustained.  Stage 1 sleep is characterized by rhythmic theta. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR:    90 bpm
IMPRESSION:  This EEG is within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The prominent hyperventilation response described above is a normal finding.  If additional information is needed to characterize this patient's
epileptiform activity, a more prolonged tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep or a study with additional hyperventilation may be of value.
