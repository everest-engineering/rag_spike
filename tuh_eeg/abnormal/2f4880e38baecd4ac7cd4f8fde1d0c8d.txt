CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 19-year-old male, having episodes of shaking and teeth chattering, blurred vision lasting a few seconds.  No past medical history of epilepsy.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are completed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm was 10-10.5 Hz in frequency, 20-30 microvolt in amplitude seen in the occipital region, which attenuates the eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Hyperventilation results in symmetric slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate was 70 beats per minute and regular.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness only.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of the sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
