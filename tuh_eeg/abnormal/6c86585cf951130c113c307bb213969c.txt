EEG length is 25 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY: 73 y/o with PMH of seizures, Hepatitis C, dementia
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, Aricept and others.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 75-year-old man with past medical history of seizures, hepatitis C and dementia.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10-11 Hz, low-amplitude alpha that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
During drowsiness, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) and symmetrical vertex waves are captured.
Hyperventilation was not performed.
Stepped photic stimulation results in no significant change in the background.
A single EKG demonstrated a heart rate with fewer than 60 beats a minute during drowsiness.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Rare sinus bradycardia.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 25-minute EEG.  No epileptiform discharges were captured, however stage II sleep was not recorded. If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
