CLINICAL HISTORY:  27 year old right handed woman with 3 weeks with confusional spells, difficulty findings words, chest pain, feelings of panic, poor sleep.  Positive family history of aneurysms and multiple sclerosis.
MEDICATIONS:  None
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 9.5 Hz alpha rhythm.  A 10 Hz mu rhythm is identified, but testing is not performed to confirm this.  Lambda waves are noted.  Drowsiness is characterized by the attenuation of the alpha followed by POSTs and then vertex waves.  Vertex waves, K complexes and spindles characterized stage 2 sleep.  Hyperventilation produces some hypersynchronous rhythmic slowing.  Photic stimulation elicits bilateral driving.
HR:    60 bpm
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  No epileptiform features are identified.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
