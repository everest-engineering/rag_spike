CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 25-year-old female with history of new onset seizure-like activity described as having chills, seeing colors, and patterns and bad smell followed by 30 seconds of loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Trileptal, Celexa.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In the most alert state, alpha rhythm is 9.5-10 Hz in frequency seen in the occipital region, which attenuates with eye opening.  There is a small amount of low amplitude, frontocentral beta activity, which is distributed symmetrically.  Drowsiness is characterized by disappearance of the alpha rhythms, slowing of the background, and absence of muscle and eye blink artifact.  Hyperventilation results in symmetrical slowing of the background.  Photic stimulation was performed at multiple flash frequencies and results in a symmetric driving response.  Heart rate is 70 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal EEG recording capturing wakefulness through drowsiness.  No epileptiform abnormalities were identified in this record.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  A normal EEG does not rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are a clinical concern, a repeat EEG capturing deeper stages of sleep or a 24-hour ambulatory EEG may be helpful.
