TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  Some T4 electrode artifact occurring intermittently.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a posterior dominant rhythm that reaches 9 to 10 Hz which is reactive to eye opening.  There is normal frontocentral beta.  The patient had stage I sleep noted.  Activating procedures including hyperventilation and photic stimulation produced no abnormal discharges.
Heart rate 84.
