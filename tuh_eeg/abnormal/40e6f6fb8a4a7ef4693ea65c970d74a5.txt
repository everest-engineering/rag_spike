CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 31-year-old right handed woman with childhood epilepsy.  History of absence seizures.  Tonic/clonic seizures.  The patient experienced as exacerbation of her epilepsy with a prolonged fugue state in November following a bout of gastroenteritis.
MEDICATIONS:  Carbatrol
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  Technically, a significant head rocking artifact was noted, particularly in the right occipital region.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a high amplitude 9 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta.  Minimal drowsiness is characterized by a decrease of eye movement and anterior spread of the alpha rhythm.
Hyperventilation generates a vigorous hyperventilation response with bursts of rhythmic high amplitude rhythmic mixed beta delta.  In addition, there is frontally predominant underlying 3-5 Hz spike and wave activity noted in brief bursts and a little bit of irregularity in the posterior regions.  A handful of the bursts of paroxysmal slowing are posteriorly predominant.
Photic stimulation also elicited rare spike and wave activity which was frontally predominant and a single burst was noted as the patient became drowsy following photic stimulation towards the end of the record.
Heart rate:  60 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Three to 5 Hz spike and wave activity.
Occasional occipitally predominant slowing noted in hyperventilation.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  These findings are similar to previous EEGs and support a generalized mechanism for epilepsy.  As has been seen in previous studies, this EEG may be compatible with a primary secondarily generalized mechanism for seizures.
