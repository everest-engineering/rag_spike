LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 36-year-old man with dizzy spells, lasting from 30 minutes to several hours.  These have increased in frequency over the last 6 months.
MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording was performed according to the 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed or modulated 10.5 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at low amplitudes anteriorly.  Intermittent lambda is captured during wakefulness.  During drowsiness the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep) are captured.  Diffuse excess of beta is observed.
Hyperventilation is performed with good effort and produces an increase in the heart rate to approximately 100 beats a minute, but does not change significantly the background.
Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
FINDINGS:
No stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
Excess beta.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG.  No clear electrographic seizures were captured, however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizure persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
