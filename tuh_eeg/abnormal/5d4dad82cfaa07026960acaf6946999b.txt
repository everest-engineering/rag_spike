CLINICAL HISTORY: 54 year old right handed female, status epilepticus, distress. The patient is very combative and agitated. The patient was given 2 mg Ativan at 6:30a.m. before the hook up for agitation.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-2d system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the recording begins the patient is quite sedated. The background is markedly slow with slow delta and beta frequency in the central region. Occasional right anterior temporal sharp waves are observed. the EEG continues there is an increase in alpha frequency activity and a bit more central beta. This is a b.. more prominent on the left compared to the right.
HR: 90bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing, improving over the course of the EEG.
2. Right anterior temporal sharp waves.
3. Focal features including disruption of faster frequency activity on the right.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a focal mechanism for epilepsy. It is a
dynamic record compatible with a postictal state.
