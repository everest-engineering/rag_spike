CLINICAL HISTORY: 35 year old right handed female with left mesiotemporal
sclerosis, epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Lamictal

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: As the tracing begins the patient is asleep. In
wakefulness, there is a well defined, 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small
amount of low voltage frontal central beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed with
good effort, producing an increase in background theta. Vertex waves, K-complexes,
and spindles are noted in stage 2 sleep. There are a handful shifting asymmetries in
the temporal region noted in sleep. Photic stimulation is performed while the patient is
falling asleep and does not activate the record.

HR: 78 bpm

IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage 2 sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed on this EEG, but a
normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
