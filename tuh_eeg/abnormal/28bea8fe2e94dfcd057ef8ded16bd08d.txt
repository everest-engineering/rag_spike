CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 37-year-old woman with epilepsy, 1-2 seizures per month for the last 2 years.  They occur out of sleep, are tonic-clonic, and associated with tongue biting.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin and Keppra.
INTRODUCTION:  A digital video EEG was performed in the lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were completed.  This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 10 Hz alpha rhythm, which is symmetric and reactive to eye opening.  There is a small amount of low-voltage frontal central beta.  Features of drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm and an increase in beta.  Eye blink was noted during a portion of the record of unclear significance.
Hyperventilation produced an increase in bilateral background slowing.
Photic stimulation elicited vigorous bilateral driving.
Heart rate:  96 BPM.
IMPRESSION:  Normal EEG in wakefulness through stage II sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This is the second normal EEG for this adult.  Additional recording strategies may be helpful to capture epileptiform activity.
