CLINICAL HISTORY: 42 year old right handed male with a breakthrough and
Dilantin toxicity. Active polysubstance abuse. Perinatal right frontal infarct.
MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Depakote
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard
system of electrode placement with 1channel EKG. Photic stimulation was

HR: 90 bpm
IMPRESSION: A normal EEG due to:
1. Background disorganization and slowing.
2. Subtle focal slowing from the right hemisphere, particularly frontocentral
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a diffuse disturbance of
function which may e due to postictal state or metabolic encephalopathy.
