CLINICAL HISTORY: 52 year old right handed female with headaches and changes in mental status, intermittent episodes where she does not know who she is. Poor historian. History of sleep apnea, heart attack, and diabetes.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates a slow pattern. The alpha rhythm is at best 7.5 Hz in a pattern with rhythmic theta. Features of drowsiness include an increase in background slowing. Limited cognitive testing, such as counting backgrounds from 10, was not performed. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling eye movements. Photic stimulation does elicit a driving response.
HR: 84 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.
2. Rhythmic slowing.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no epileptiform features observed. The findings described above are nonspecific and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral dysfunction of many different causes, including memory disorder.
