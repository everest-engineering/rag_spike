LENGTH OF RECORDING:  28 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 20-year-old woman who is currently 6 months pregnant with a history of one seizure in 2007.  Of note, the patient has 3-4 episodes per day of zoning out.  There is a strong family history of seizures.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Prenatal vitamins.
INTRODUCTION:  The recording is performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and a single lead EKG lead.    Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.  EEG was performed in the laboratory.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5-11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and produces no significant change in the background.  Step photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.
During sleep POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients in sleep), symmetrical vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K-complexes are captured.
After a period of sleep the patient wakes up and reports feeling dizzy.  While she is reporting that the patient's EEG background remains at baseline and normal.  Heart rate remains at baseline and regular.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
Stage 2 sleep.
An episode of dizziness reported out of sleep that is not associated with an abnormal ictal activity or abnormality in the EKG.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and sleep 28 minute EEG.  The epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  An episode of dizziness reported by patient occurred out of sleep.  This dizziness was not associated with any abnormal activity seen on the scalp EEG or an abnormality in the EKG.
