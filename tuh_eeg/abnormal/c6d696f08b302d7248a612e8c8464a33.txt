CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old right handed male with migraine headaches, bipolar disease, anxiety, multiple concussions and epilepsy, with last seizure January 4, 2010. History of loss of consciousness and confusion with this seizure.
MEDICATIONS: Seroquel, Depakote, Topamax.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. There is a fair amount of muscle artifact observed in the background.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well organized with a 10.5 Hz, 65 microvolt posterior dominant rhythm, and a small amount of low voltage frontal central beta. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. This is followed by drowsiness with anterior spread with alpha rhythm. POSTS are observed in stage 1 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response.
HR: 60 bpm
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits in wakefulness and brief sleep.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were noted, but if epilepsy is an important consideration, a follow up study capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
