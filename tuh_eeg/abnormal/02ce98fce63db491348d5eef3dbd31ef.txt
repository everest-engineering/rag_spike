CLINICAL HISTORY: 46 year old right handed male with epilepsy seizure free for 18-31 years.
MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Pravastatin.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and drowsy record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is well
organized with an 11 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. Hyperventilation produces a small
increase in amplitude in the background. Drowsiness is characterized by slow rolling
eye movements in an increase in beta, followed by vertex waves. POSTS and spindles
are seen in stage 2 sleep. Photic stimulation elicits a driving response. Lambda is seen
at the close of the record in wakefulness.
HR: 72 bpm and slightly Irregular.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features are observed. Normal EEG does
not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.
