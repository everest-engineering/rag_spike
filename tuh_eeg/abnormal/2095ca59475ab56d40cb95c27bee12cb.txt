CLINICAL HISTORY: 23 year old right handed woman with a learning disability and
recurrent seizures in sleep with incontinence, tongue biting, and migraine headaches.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG is a bit slow,
slightly disorganized with a posterior dominant rhythm of 6-7 Hz, 50 mcv. Features of
drowsiness include anterior spread of the alpha rhythm. Hyperventilation produces an
increase in slowing of the background. At the close of the record just before photic,
there are portions of the record are well organized and within normal limits. Photic
stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 60 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Intermittent, excess theta in wakefulness.
2. Intermittent disorganization for age and wakefulness.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is one of many EEGs including a long-term monitor
for this patient. No seizures have ever been captured, and no epileptiform activity has
been seen. Additional recording in sleep would be necessary to identify epileptiform
activity or seizures.
