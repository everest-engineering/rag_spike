CLINICAL HISTORY: 21 year old left handed male with new onset tonic-clonic
seizures 1.5 years ago. Headaches prior to the seizures. Seizure-free for the last 6
months.
MEDICATIONS: Unknown
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness the background EEG is well organized
with symmetric, reactive, 10.3 Hz alpha rhythm of 50 microvolts. There is a
small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation is performed
early-on in the record producing an increase in amplitude of the background. Photic
stimulation elicits scant driving.
HR: 60 bpm and irregular
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed but evaluation for
the irregular heart rate may be warranted. If epilepsy is an important consideration,
please consider a repeat study capturing sleep.
