CLINICAL HISTORY:  28 year old male with new-onset seizures, history of heart valve replacement due to a congenital heart abnormality, and a history of recent endocarditis.
MEDICATIONS:  Gentamicin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The EEG was performed during wakefulness and sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz with a low amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a slightly increased amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep is captured in stage I.  Photic stimulation and hyperventilation posed no abnormal discharges.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:  None.
SEIZURES:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Normal awake and asleep EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  Please note that no seizures or epileptiform activities were seen.  A normal EEG does not exclude the diagnosis of epilepsy.  If epilepsy is still a clinical consideration, we will consider repeating the EEG with deeper stages of sleep.
