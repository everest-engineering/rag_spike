CLINICAL HISTORY: 25 year old right handed female with 2 tonic-clonic seizures in February with tonoclonic activity, tongue biting and incontinence, seizure-free since February 2009.
MEDICATIONS: None.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there Is a 10.5 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta activity. The beta activity is 20 Hz in nature. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background. Drowsiness is characterized by slowing of the background with an increase in beta and dropout of the alpha rhythm. Photic stimulation elicits a bilateral driving response.
HR: 66bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in wakefulness and light sleep.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were observed. Normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy and if seizures are an important consideration, a repeat tracing capturing deeper stages of sleep is suggested.
