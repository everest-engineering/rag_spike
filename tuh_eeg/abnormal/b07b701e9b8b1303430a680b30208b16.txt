LENGTH OF RECORDING:  30 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old man with history of blackout episodes, now status post fall from a ladder on 08/02/2013.  Patient subsequently self-referred, cervical spine injury and required surgery.
MEDICATIONS:  Labetalol, insulin, dexamethasone, potassium.
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10/20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed at the bedside.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  During periods of quiescence, the background consists of a mixture of polymorphic theta and delta activity that are low amplitudes.  No normal sleep architecture is captured, however diffuse spindle-like wave forms are observed.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are not performed.  Large portions of the recording obscured by significant diffuse EMG artifact.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Intermittent periods of significant EMG artifact.
No clear seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake only 30 minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing.  This finding indicates etiologically nonspecific moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Large portions of the EEG were obscured by diffuse EMG artifact.  This limits interpretation of the recording during those time periods.  No clear electrographic seizures were captured.
