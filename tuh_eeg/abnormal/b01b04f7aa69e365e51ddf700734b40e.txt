CLINICAL HISTORY.: 79 year old woman with severe coronary artery disease, COPD, stroke, breast cancer and a syncopal event with dizziness and head trauma on 12/28.

MEDICATIONS: Spiriva, Zocor, Metoprolol, Advair

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. There is no hyperventilation or photic stimulation. This is an awake and drowsy record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates relatively rhythmic background slowing with a posterior dominant rhythm of 7.5 hertz, 40 microvolts and primarily a theta or alpha theta frequency background. Features of drowsiness include slow rolling eye movements. Heart rate irregular at 90 BPM.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Generalized background slowing.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This is a nonspecific pattern and can be seen in a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function. No epileptiform features were observed. If epilepsy is an important consideration, a repeat tracing in the lab with photic stimulation and more extensive sleep may be appropriate.
