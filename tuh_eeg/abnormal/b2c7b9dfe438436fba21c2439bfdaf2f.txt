CLINICAL HISTORY: 38 year old gentleman status post slab injury and acute trauma on May 9th. Episode of cardiac arrest in the trauma bay with shaking. Evaluate for myoclonus.

MEDICATIONS: Versed, Dilantin, Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed. The patient is intubated and febrile as described above. Current body temperature 103.8.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG does demonstrate a preserved cerebral pattern. There is low to medium voltage, mixed frequency primary theta frequency activity of 5.4 hertz, but there is also some 3.5 hertz delta activity and smaller amounts of beta. In this video study, the patient is postured with his head looking to the right. The big EEG machine and video camera are on the left. The camera demonstrates intermittent jerking of the chest and this correlates with some muscle artifact seen diffusely through the EEG. The brief jerks of muscle artifact are not clearly associated with epileptiform activity. There is a suggestion of a vertex sharp wave seen independently of the jerks and on 1 or 2 occasions, as the recording continues, there does appear to be a slow wave that follows some of the jerks. There is a small degree of discontinuity.

HR: 144 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. A primarily theta/theta delta pattern following cardiac arrest.
2. High amplitude myoclonic jerks, but some of these seem to have an after going slow wave.
3. Vertex sharp waves.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The presence of an after going slow wave would suggest that the myoclonus is epileptiform in nature. Additional intervention may be appropriate.
