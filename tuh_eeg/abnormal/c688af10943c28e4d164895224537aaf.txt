LENGTH OF RECORDING:  21 minutes
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording is performed using standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed.
HISTORY:  The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of seizures who is set to undergo VNS placement.  The patient had several seizures last week.
MEDICATIONS:  Vimpat, Zonegran, Restoril and tramadol.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORDING:  There is no clear posterior dominant rhythm and anterior-posterior frequency amplitude gradient is nearly always absent.  The background consists of moderate amplitude polymorphic diffuse theta activity with intermittent delta activity.
Additionally, diffuse broad triphasic-like wave forms, often with anterior to posterior lag, are captured.  These wave forms are sharply contoured and are occasionally followed by slowing, but these wave forms are not clearly epileptiform.  Periods of quiescence are noted; however, no clear normal sleep architecture is observed.  Hyperventilation is not performed.  Photic stimulation does not result in additional abnormalities.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing.
Broadly-based diffuse sharply-contoured triphasic-like discharges, often followed by slowing.  However, these discharges are not clearly epileptiform.  No electrographic seizures.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal 21-minute EEG due to moderate diffuse slowing, disorganization and diffuse broadly-based, sharply-contoured discharges.  Slowing and disorganization indicate etiologically nonspecific,  diffuse cerebral dysfunction.  Diffuse broadly-formed triphasic like wave forms are of unclear clinical significance; however,  they are sharply contoured.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
