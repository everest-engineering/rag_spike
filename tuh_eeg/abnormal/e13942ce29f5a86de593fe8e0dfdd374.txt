CLINICAL HISTORY: 44 year old right handed male with head trauma in 2008, subsequent epilepsy.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, the background EEG includes a
well-organized 10 Hz alpha rhythm with a small amount of low voltage frontocentral beta
activity. Drowsiness is characterized by slow-rolling eye movements. Vertex waves are
noted in stage I sleep. Hyperventilation does not activate the record. Photic stimulation
elicits a driving response. Head rocking artifact and a skull defect are noted
intermittently in the frontocentral regions.

HR: N/A

IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: The skull defect and associated breech rhythm are not
pathologic abnormalities. No epileptiform features were seen.
