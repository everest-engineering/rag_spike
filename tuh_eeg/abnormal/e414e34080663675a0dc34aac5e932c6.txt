CLINICAL HISTORY: 27 year old male a history of gunshot wound to the left side of
the skull and chronic daily headaches.

MEDICATIONS: Dilantin, Percocet, Tylenol, Phenytoin, Gabapentin

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The right hemisphere demonstrates a reasonably well-organized background with a 9 Hz posterior dominant rhythm. The left hemisphere demonstrates continuous theta. Hyperventilation accentuates the theta rhythmic data from the left hemisphere. Photic stimulation elicits scant driving.

HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Continuous slowing from the hemisphere.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a structural or functional abnormality on the left involving gray and white matter congruent with the history.
