CLINICAL HISTORY: 45 year old woman with seizures in 1987 which were attributed either to the use of Vistaril or medications or substance abuse; now with recurrent seizure earlier this month.

MEDICATIONS: Dyazide, Clonidine, Risperdal
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG. Hyperventilation and photic stimulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm with a generous amount of low-voltage, frontocentral beta activity. Hyperventilation produces an increase in amplitude of the background as well as a small amount of theta. In drowsiness, there is rhythmic theta and on one occasion there is the suggestion of rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness. In the transition to stage II sleep, there is one BETS. Posts, vertex waves, and spindles are noted in stage II sleep, although the posts are slightly higher amplitude on the left. Photic stimulation is performed, although the patient is falling asleep and does not significantly activate the record.

HR: 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: EEG within normal limits.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: There were no definitive epileptiform features, although there were some normal variants. In this individual with a recent seizure, if further information is needed, a repeat study capturing more extensive sleep is suggested.
