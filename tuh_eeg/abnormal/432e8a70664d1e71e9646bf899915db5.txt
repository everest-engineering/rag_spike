CLINICAL HISTORY: 64 year old female presented with a Brainstem stroke, persistently unresponsive.

MEDICATIONS: ASA, Cipro, Heparin, Simvastatin, Isosorbide, Coreg.,

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Patient is intubated but is stimulated during the record.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG is markedly slow with a mixture of theta and delta. In addition, there are sharp wave complexes noted in the record including right central parietal and left posterior temporal. Stimulation of the patient produces little in the way of alerting response.

HR: 110 bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Markedly slow background.
2. Epileptiform activity in both hemispheres, some of which appears in trains or is somewhat periodic in nature.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a significant disturbance of cerebral function affecting both gray and white matter. The epileptiform activity is of unclear significance but may merit additional intervention and evaluation.
