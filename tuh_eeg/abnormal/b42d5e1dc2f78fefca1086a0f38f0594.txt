CLINICAL HISTORY:  A 53-year-old woman with Alzheimer dementia, hep C, found to have a seizure with urinary incontinence.
MEDICATIONS:  Aricept, Lovenox, Zoloft, Risperdal, Trileptal
REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video routine EEG was performed using the standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded while lethargic.  Activating procedures were not performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a diffusely slow background with no normal posterior dominant rhythm or frontocentral beta.  Patient is recorded mainly in wakefulness, although some sleep is captured.  Activating procedures were not performed.  During the recording, the patient is stimulated with sternal rub.  There appears to be some muscle artifact with no clear improvement in the frequencies.  The background is composed of mainly delta activity seen diffusely.  However, throughout the recording, there is overriding central predominant sharply contoured periodic waveform that waxes and wanes in frequency and at times becomes more predominant and has a sharp contour, although not clearly epileptiform.
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:
Generalized slow waves at 2-4 Hz and an amplitude of 20-60 microvolts.
Periodic complex with maximal central frontal predominance, at times sharply contoured seen at about 0.5 Hz continuously throughout the recording, not clearly consistent with vertex waves and of unclear significance.
SEIZURES:  None
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Generalized slow waves.
Periodic central complexes.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is nonspecific with regards to etiology.  However, the periodic central
complexes are of unclear etiology.  Further recording and monitoring may aid in elucidating their significance.
