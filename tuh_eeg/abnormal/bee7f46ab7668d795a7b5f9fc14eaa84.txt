DATE OF THE RECORDING:  07/09/2013 from approximately 7:00 p.m. until 07/10/2013 at approximately 8:00 a.m.  Total length of the recording is approximately 7 hours, since the patient was disconnected from the system from approximately 2:00 a.m. until approximately 8:00 a.m.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 42-year-old man with a history of seizures since childhood, who now presents with increase in seizure frequency.  Seizures are characterized by change in mental status lasting approximately 10-20 seconds.
MEDICATIONS:  Tegretol and Depakote.
CONDITIONS OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single lead EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were not performed.  The recording was performed continuously.  The recording was reviewed several times during the recording period.  The patient was equipped with an event button.  Pushbutton events were reviewed.  Medication staff notes and technician notes were reviewed as well.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  There is no posterior dominant rhythm and no anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  The background consists of a mixture of polymorphic low to moderate amplitude theta and delta activity.  Periods of sleep are brief and are characterized by symmetrical sleep spindles.  No electrographic seizures were captured.
FINDINGS:
Moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.
No electrographic seizures.  Brief fragmented sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal awake and asleep 7-hour continuous audio-video EEG recording due to moderate diffuse slowing and disorganization.  This finding indicates diffuse cerebral dysfunction that is etiologically nonspecific.  No electrographic seizures were captured.  These findings were conveyed to the neurology primary team.
