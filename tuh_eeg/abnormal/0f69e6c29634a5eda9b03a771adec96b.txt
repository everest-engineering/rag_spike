LENGTH OF RECORDING:  23 minutes and 48 seconds.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 49-year gentleman with past medical history of stroke in 2002 with subsequent left sided weakness, possible myocardial infarction.  He now presents with loss of consciousness.
MEDICATIONS:  Lovenox, Coumadin.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG is performed in the lab/bedside using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel of EKG.  Photic stimulation is performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of low to moderate amplitude, well formed and modulated 10-10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eye opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient.  Intermittently fast alpha variant is observed.
During drowsiness diffuse theta is present.  By the end of the recording vertex waves and very briefly sleep spindles are captured.
Hyperventilation is not performed.
Photic stimulation results in symmetrical occipital driving.
A regular cardiac rhythm is captured on a single EKG lead.
FINDINGS:
Brief stage II sleep.
No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake, drowsy, and very briefly asleep 23-minute EEG.  The lack of epileptiform discharges in the routine EEG does not exclude a
diagnosis a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  A regular cardiac rhythm was captured on a single EKG lead.
