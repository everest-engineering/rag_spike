LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  Nearly 21 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a past medical history of seizures and mood disturbance and a long history of Xanax use.  She now presents with an episode of decreased responsiveness with associated left facial droop.
MEDICATIONS: Keppra, Xanax
CONDITION OF THE RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with an additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was performed.  Photic stimulation was not performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of a well-formed and modulated 10 to 11 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  Alpha amplitude is higher over the right hemispheric leads.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and prolonged bursts of symmetrical rhythmic frontal moderate amplitude theta activity is observed.  Hyperventilation is performed with poor effort and results in no change in the background. Stepped photic stimulation is not performed.  There were no clear epileptiform discharges.
FINDINGS:
No clear epileptiform discharges.
No stage II sleep.
Runs of bifrontal rhythmic theta during drowsiness.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 21-minute EEG.  Runs of anterior rhythmic theta activity are of uncertain clinical significance.  No clear epileptiform discharges were captured; however, stage II sleep was not recorded.  If clinical indication for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage II sleep may be of benefit.
