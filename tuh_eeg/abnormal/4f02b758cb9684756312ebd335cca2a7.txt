CLINICAL HISTORY: n year old woman status post PEA code at 18:20 one day ago
with now facial twitching. History of heart failure, dementia and MI.
MEDICATIONS: Ativan, Simvastatin, Lexapro, Glipizide.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. The patient is intubated and
poorly responsive. Hyperventilation and photic simulation are performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: The background EEG demonstrates nearly
continuous, diffuse 13 Hz beta frequency activity. Superimposed upon this, there are
some asymmetries. The left hemisphere, particularly the left posterior quadrant is more
attenuated in the left posterior quadrant. There is more beta frequency activity in the
right than the left and there is a beta accentuation at C4, T4. Tactile stimulation of the
patient does not activate the record.
HR: 104 bpm
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Replacement of normal background primarily with a beta frequency pattern.
2. Superimposed asymmetry with relatively less beta and more suppression in the left
particularly in the posterior quadrant
CLINICAL CORRELATION: This patient's 8 mg Ativan could contribute to the beta
activity described above. The focal asymmetries may be assessed clinically and/or with
Imaging. No seizures were noted.
