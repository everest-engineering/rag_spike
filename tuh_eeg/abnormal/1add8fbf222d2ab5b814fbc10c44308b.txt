CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 63-year-old man with alcohol withdrawal had 1 episode of seizure and then became drowsy and disoriented.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, thiamine, Serax, and lorazepam.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed at bedside using the standardized 10/20 system of electrode placement with 1 channel EKG.  Hyperventilation was deferred, but photic stimulation was completed.
DESCRIPTION OF RECORD:  In brief periods of wakefulness, the posterior dominant rhythm was between 7-7.5 Hz and was characterized by slowing of posterior dominant rhythm.  In most of the recording, the patient remained drowsy with background activity characterized by low amplitude slowing in theta and delta range, which was intermixed with intermittent fast frequency in alpha range, 10-11 Hz in frequency.  There is also occasional sleep elements as spindles with frontal central distribution.  No epileptiform discharges or seizure activities were noted during this recording.  The patient had several episodes of body movements with no EEG correlation.
Heart rate was 90 BPM with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION:  This is an abnormal EEG due to:  Diffuse low amplitude slowing of background activity.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  The diffuse slowing can have a wide range of differential diagnosis and could be seen in postictal states, (toxic-metabolic abnormalities, infectious, or bilateral cerebral dysfunction). Clinical Correlation recommended. There are no epileptiform discharges in this EEG, but this does not exclude the possibility of intermittent seizure activity.  If there are concerns for seizure activity, repeat EEG or long-term monitoring EEG maybe helpful.  Please note that the patient had multiple PVCs on EKG recording.
