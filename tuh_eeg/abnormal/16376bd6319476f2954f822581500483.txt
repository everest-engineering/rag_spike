LENGTH OF RECORDING:  22 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 47-year-old woman with history of carbon monoxide poisoning with associated loss of consciousness on 10/20/2012.  She now has symptoms of headache, dull diffuse pain, memory loss, swallowing difficulties, shortness of breath, and motion sickness.
MEDICATIONS:  None listed.
CONDITION OF RECORDING:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrode and single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation was not performed. Stepped photic stimulation was performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant consists of a well-formed and modulated 9.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient, with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During sleep, POSTS (positive occipital sharp transients of sleep), vertex waves, sleep spindles, and K complexes are captured.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  Stepped photic stimulation results in occipital driving at multiple flash frequencies.  A single EKG lead demonstrates a heart rate fewer than 60 beats a minute.
FINDINGS:  No epileptiform discharges.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and asleep electroencephalogram.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine electroencephalogram does not preclude the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.  Heart rate with fewer than 60 beats per minute is captured on a single-electrocardiogram lead.
