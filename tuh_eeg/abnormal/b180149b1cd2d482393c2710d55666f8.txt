INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed using standard 10-20 system of electrode placement with one channel EKG.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were deferred.  This was an awake and a sleep record in a patient with frequent transitions in and out of sleep.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  In wakefulness, there is a 9 Hz alpha rhythm.  The patient transitions in and out of stage I sleep with rhythmic central theta followed by drowsiness and then arousals.  There are rare bursts of delta as the patient transitions in and out of sleep.
Heart rate 72 bpm.
IMPRESSION:  EEG within normal limits.
No focal or epileptiform features were identified in this record.  A normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.  If seizures are important consideration, a follow up study may be of value.
