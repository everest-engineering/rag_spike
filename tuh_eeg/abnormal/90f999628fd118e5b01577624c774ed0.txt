REASON FOR STUDY:  Seizure.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a 91-year-old woman with past medical history of stroke and residual right-sided weakness, and hypertension and new onset seizure 5 days and 3 days prior to this EEG, the patient had 2 episodes of staring and not responsiveness and was started on Dilantin.
MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin, albuterol, amlodipine, Motrin, aspirin, omeprazole.
INTRODUCTION:  A routine EEG was performed using the standard 10/20 electrode placement system with anterior temporal and single lead EKG electrode.  The patient was recorded during wakefulness and drowsiness and stage I and 2 of sleep.  Activating procedures included hyperventilation and photic stimulation.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a somewhat slow and disorganized background for age with alpha rhythm that reaches 7.5 Hz and reactive to eye opening.  There is sharply contoured slowing on T1 more than T2 region.  Drowsiness is characterized by increased slowing and decreased muscle activity.  Stage II of sleep is characterized by K complexes and spindles.  Activating procedures included photic stimulation, which wakes the patient up and increases muscle activity.
Heart rate is 72.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to:
Slow and disorganized background and somewhat slow for age.
Sharply contoured slowing more on T1 than T2.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of mild left temporal slowing and somewhat slowing in the right temporal region.  The slowing could be due to the cerebral dysfunction, which can be explained by the previous stroke.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen on this EEG.
