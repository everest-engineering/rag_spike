CLINICAL HISTORY: 26 year old right handed female with daily migraines associated
with epistaxis.
MEDICATIONS: Amitriptyline.
INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 1 0-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
simulation are performed. This is an awake and asleep record.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness background EEG is well organized
with a 12 Hz alpha rhythm and a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta activity.
Features of drowsiness including increase in beta. As the patient becomes sleepier,
there is an increase in theta. Hyperventilation does not activate the record.
Photic stimulation elicits driving at faster flash frequencies.
HR: 66 bpm
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG.
CLINICAL CORRELATION: No epileptiform features were identified.
