CLINICAL HISTORY:. 19 year old right handed woman with epilepsy since age 5,
tonoclonic seizures. Last EEG 2007.

MEDICATIONS: Tegretol.

INTRODUCTION: Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20
system of electrode placement with 1 channel of EKG. Hyperventilation and photic
stimulation are performed.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: In wakefulness, there is a 10.5 Hz alpha rhythm
with a small amount of low voltage, frontocentral beta. Just prior to hyperventilation,
there is a pair of 3.5 Hz spike and wave complexes. Hyperventilation also elicits in brief
bursts. Following hyperventilation there is an isolated, very subtle sharp and slow wave
complex again noted in the frontal regions. Features of drowsiness included an increase
in beta. Photic stimulation elicits brief bilateral driving.

HR: 100bpm

IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to:
1. Frontally predominant spike and wave activity identified in relaxed wakefulness
and augmented by hyperventilation.

CLINICAL CORRELATION: This EEG supports a generalized mechanism for epilepsy'
as can be seen in inherited epilepsy. No burst was longer than a second in duration ..
Comparison with this patient's previous EEG April 20, 2007 has not yet been possible
but this EEG supports an inherited mechanism for epilepsy. Of note, carbamazepine
which is this patient's seizure medication may accentuate this phenomenon.
