LENGTH OF THE RECORDING:  27 minutes.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient is a 17-year-old man with a chief complaint of dizziness, lightheadedness, numbness mostly in the arm.  These episodes started over 6 months ago and occur approximately 1-2 times a week.  He has a history of 2 concussions, last 04/11/2013.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  None.
INTRODUCTION:  Conditions of the Recording:  The recording was performed according to the standard 10-20 system with additional T1 and T2 electrodes and a single EKG lead.  Hyperventilation and photic stimulation were performed.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The posterior dominant rhythm consists of well-formed and modulated moderate amplitude 10.5 Hz alpha activity that attenuates with eyes opening.  There is an anterior to posterior frequency amplitude gradient with faster frequencies at lower amplitudes anteriorly.  During drowsiness, the posterior dominant rhythm attenuates and bursts of theta are captured.
Hyperventilation is performed with fair effort and results in no significant change in the background.
Photic stimulation does not result in occipital driving.
FINDINGS:
No epileptiform discharges.
No stage 2 sleep.
IMPRESSION:  This is a normal awake and drowsy 27-minute EEG. No epileptiform discharges were captured, however, stage 2 sleep was not recorded. If clinical suspicion for seizures persists, a repeat study with stage 2 sleep may be of benefit.  The lack of epileptiform discharges on a routine EEG does not preclude a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.
